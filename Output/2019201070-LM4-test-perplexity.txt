What does additives do.	403.87764430235654
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.3446805143128864
In most cases you will notice , if you look into literature , that the km value undergo a change.	68.52166649453324
In this case as we discussed earlier that , tendency to homo propagate , and tendency to cross propagate is same , so what happen.	361.813248564539
For example in this practical case of penicillin acylase catalyzed hydrolysis of penicillin the kinetic rate expression comes as k2.e0 v = 1 + km / s ( 1 + a / kia ) + p / kip ( 1 + km / s ) they have developed the reaction performance equations but the quantitative comparison of cstr and pfr in such cases will become more and more complex.	496.65137860488835
But in case if you getting a p d i value is one point less than 2 for a polymers which you have taken out from the solution which means that the low molecular samples which might have left in the solution.	331.6327422889971
So , except the two ends , each segment have z minus 1 contact.	22.411737971311457
This enzyme particularly will be able to act upon a large variety of hexose as a substrate and it can phosphorylate.	459.0491443267588
Theoretically one can produce enzymes from any living source microbial , plant or animals but the trend in the reason past has been that the microorganism has been the preferred choice for variety of reasons.	4696.9003888901525
So , if you look few data s you take butadiene and isoprene; obviously , we will compare anionic at anionic polymerization 20 degree centigrade in non - polar medium hexane , anionic polymers at almost similar temperature at non - polar medium.	591.3085081739673
And , if you choose not to write 2, then during the initiation reaction also you have to choose not to write 2 in the; it will come back that initiation reaction , rate of initiation , again when you write the expression for r i , rate of initiation.	314.6094569603662
L , the characteristics of this function is that when.	153.93764743145596
Then ph is another feature.	105.7286916230693
And we know that in case of radical copolymerization basically there are numerous options where you can choose two monomers and make a copolymer from there.	171.87386971104107
The drawback is that they might , it is produced colour bodies , and that will discolour the polymer matrixs.	1873.6934977287979
Stage ii , at the end of stage ii all the monomer droplets disappeared , because the monomer has been supplied to the reacting polymer particle , surrounded by the surfactant molecules , and stage iii is basically the completion of the polymerization reaction inside those reacting , or active polymer particles.	482.98278461953134
So , let us first talk about the effect of polar groups.	16.541900599883324
You are proposing an operational reaction mechanism which may be slightly different than that proposed by michaelis menten or others earlier as we discussed and that mechanism need to be understood very clearly and that will give you a physical picture of the enzyme substrate binding.	581.9547383196224
Now , briefly talk about polymer blends , polymer blends is basically mixture of more than one homo polymers or copolymers.	101.47607772407375
So , this is another way we can cyclic and form and this is the process is called backbiting , from the end of the polymer chain to the back bone of the existing polymer chain.	203.41370925004347
So , primary anti oxidant , as you said , as i just mentioned , it traps this r dot and proxy radicals.	175.20404499019313
So , in that case , there is a limitation , there is a limit at which you can take out the condensate from a system.	46.54135273579205
Even for example in the case of a cstr people have immobilized the enzyme on to the base of the and carryout the reaction.	113.89911574906561
That means the enzyme reactor system becomes more and more controlled by diffusional limitations and when the enzyme loading is less the diffusional limitations are less.	73.56339003319579
One is to understand the reaction mechanism that a particular reaction follows and second thing is design of reactors.	205.03511096394206
Now , this term twice is introduced; in some text , this twice is introduced , because that the 1 termination reaction is effective in bringing the termination of 2 radical.	1713.596306163558
In case if the fraction of conversion required is very high if you are looking for a 99 % conversion , it will be desirable to use a plug flow reactor with a partial recycle.	58.42727403167443
Based volume , performance and price polymers can be also categorized in two class , three classes.	2571.5385697848074
They will be from different groups as we mentioned from electron donating groups and withdrawing groups and one from electron donating groups.	1612.3596593825112
So , in that case intrinsic viscosity will be smaller.	22.44175366364669
Now before we end this lecture , let us go through the commercial , a few commercial coordination polymers.	204.2368994947327
The second category and probably which is of most significance to us as in the case of immobilized enzyme systems are continuous flow reactors because the major purpose of the immobilizing enzymes is to use them in continuous modes or repeated mode.	912.8004877828154
So , with the exposer to uv light , it turns yellow; as a result of that , bond cleavage will be high energy uv light; and , as the result , the polymer becomes embrittle.	610.3870687247727
Now , what is the reason that this monomers are difficult to polymerize.	36.51574211065623
This surface , they have a thickness delta on the basis of the physical properties of the substrate molecule and the carrier particle.	71.97500694463592
You can choose any of these monomers , which were utilized to make homopolymers , and then mix them , and also you can mix them in , or make copolymers in different proportion.	203.46381705236115
Then degree of inhibition for the competitive inhibition also depends upon all the parameters and the expression for degree of inhibition for competitive inhibitor can be written as km . i / ki i = { km ( 1 + i / ki ) } + s the degree of inhibition depends on substrate concentration , inhibitor concentration and also on km and ki.	274.77850022884826
For example , let us take example of this general structure and see how we can think of a different polymers producing getting produced from these general 1, 3 butadiene type monomers.	248.77174550697586
So , if there is any chain transfer reaction , the actual value of x n bar will come down and c s and other c s , it could be a s , could be a monomer a solvent or a molecule , which are added from outside by deliberately or by , it present as impurities.	206.84481853915653
Instead of hydrogen peroxide , you can use the other peroxides , so hydro peroxides as well , and this case you can use other ions as well.	148.88238992427102
Because conversion is defined the fraction of functional group has reacted , in this case , a present in a small amount.	257.59908566717337
Buffers were not a very common tool to be used in the kinetic analysis.	124.56415281370941
We will discuss this , effect of this little detailed with examples.	258.0302557022075
And there are relative methods where you actually require a calibration curve by known polymer molecular weight where the molecule and the molecular have been determined by these absolute techniques.	883.1896171377476
There is no water present in the proximity of the enzyme molecule and the hydrophobic matrix and the enzyme is immobilized in a hydrophobic patch and it is suspended then in the organic solvent.	122.77638335810383
If you do it in a little higher say about 40 percent you get like this if you say 60 percent is the 60 percent monomer in the solution , you gel effect 80 percent you get even before the this 100, 100 percent conversion , this is bulk.	899.9260209716342
If you have a molecules which have only one functionality for example , instead of ethylene glycol you have a phenol molecules , then once this weights of phenol is reacted you , the chain does not goes , you you cannot make a polymers.	554.4961038363589
The first and probably the foremost is yield of immobilization.	152.52588507050203
Two major sectors of applications of immobilized enzymes are analytical applications and also their application in the therapeutics for the treatment of diseases in human beings and both the applications are also particularly important or in contrast to the application as industrial catalyst lies in the effect that you require much more purified systems and the use of high value enzymes in their applications unlike in the case of industrial biocatalyst where mostly we were dealing with relatively lesser valued enzymes and the two applications on analytical applications and therapeutics require relatively high value enzymes and in a higher purified state.	1552.8001716463639
One : that reactivates of both functional groups in a bi functional monomers are same.	982.1882318531513
The other group of application sector is analytical applications.	177.9170327002594
The antibodies and enzyme molecules in terms of their dissociation constant for their counter part in the case of enzymes it is substrate in case of anti bodies , they are antigens.	908.6315072993954
How you typically name these step polymers.	1558.4809184214157
Usually the covalently immobilized enzyme preparations will have a half life of few months when operated in a reactor and when stored under storage conditions it could go even for years without any loss of activity in terms of half life.	966.5288656837865
When you making chain polymers , what you doing.	189.89646855124312
This is last and most important.	159.62467157527902
The cell membrane is much more specific and has quiet distinct features compared to an ordinary ultra filtration cell which only functions based on molecular weight.	1371.8807792789962
They selected the height of the column based on the pressure drop limitations so that don t have to face very severe pressure drops.	703.092401186832
So , we consider this general reaction.	24.213440510066878
So , ticl 4 have more lewis acidity compared to , tl , ticl 3 than this.	785.5712338529677
So , basically good properties are favored by high molecular rate of polymers.	184.080347519368
This is an enzyme catalyzed reaction which is used commercially all over the world and particularly 6 - amino pencillanic acid is used as the intermediate for synthesis of ampicillin and today because the use of penicillin as an oral drug has reduced significantly excepting for application . . . . ointment.	1799.8798943522975
Any mechanism by which you can take the reactant closer to a transition state not by formation of transition state any other mechanism which can do that will facilitate or reduce the energy of activation.	411.17217234193635
Ultimately at equilibrium or in steady state condition the net effect will be that the bulk of the enzyme will be in the form of ess.	106.02567175912031
Because , the contact angle between the water and the polymeric surface is very high so , it basically rolls off and giving the strolling of process , it can take away that , they are the impurities , which are present in the surface.	240.8551175189339
Minimum information should be provided so that anybody who wants to reproduce the method can use it for further work.	2417.797495821232
But when you go from 0.9 to 0.99, the relative quantity of enzyme becomes more than five times and it very significantly increases the relative quantity in the first order regime.	381.2337677376841
And this rotation or the mobility of the polymer chain depends upon the stiffness of the backbone or the flexibility of the backbone , steric effect , side group , which is basically governed by the side group present and inter molecular forces; the more intermolecular forces , the less is the freedom to move.	415.3020766349467
That is the order of magnitude which the binding energy goes in the binding of the substrate.	52.95181016091205
So , now , we can plot this as a combined function of c and theta.	82.23927696330914
But this was disputed by briggs and haldane particularly observing certain reactions which were known to be relatively fast.	850.0674841572423
You can define co - operativity index as long as you mention; if it is s0.75 / s0.1 or s0.9 / s0.1, or it could be any ratio.	883.3783110418703
As you can understand that crystalline regions , semi - crystalline polymers will have crystalline regions of high stiff regions which basically gives you higher rigidity , but lower impact strength; obviously , you can imagine from the structure that it will give higher density.	713.7617949238166
So , we will we we talking about elastic deformation and plastic deformation , elastic deformation where on a plain releasing the stress , the sample comes up back to the original state and in case of plastic deformation , it it come it come does not come back.	811.4808369100401
And in this lecture we will continue our discussion on polymer stereochemistry and coordination polymers , which we began in the last lecture.	5.983638772451885
And if you do not what are the monomers you should not use for branching and you should also know the utility , if you what sometimes it is undesired to have branching in the polymer.	378.98391138839895
We have discussed in length about cation polymerization or an anionic polymerization of carbon carbon double bond.	52.2568900932077
Cellulosic materials are insoluble and the enzyme has to be reacted with this insoluble substrate to hydrolyze into glucose.	602.8860557793909
Polyvinyl alcohols are not produced from poly vinyl alcohol because vinyl alcohol does not exist in that.	1782.7079757294691
All variety of those functions at a molecular level has become an added dimension which has been at the center of the bio technology in general.	1217.8019255967395
The chances of forming cyclics are much more , because cyclics are not reacting with the byproduct and forming the linear product once again , which means once cyclics forms it will remain in the final product.	603.570239558889
Particularly , more importantly for resolution of racemic mixtures which we know that the enzymes are able to recognize one of the isomers the resolution can be carried out in the case of chemically synthesized racemic mixture.	547.1041300485554
Hydrophobic forces are very often considered to be a major force which is involved in the globular structure.	456.68491948614985
Now , this translational entropy does not depend too much on the monomers structure.	118.32846955197452
So , how many chains they have.	50.685902495024685
So , basically it is normalized , with the area , as well as the pressure difference across the flame thickness.	119.60456471515319
Monitor the substrate concentration or fraction of conversion with reference to time and determine the parameters by a single reactor performance data.	1128.4262084464656
So , if you do a reaction say at 50 degree centigrade or 60 degree centigrade that his below the t g glass transition temperature.	119.67057758097405
So , it is a inhibition reaction and this yb is a inhibitor if k z is little higher or may be comparable with k p , then are even part of the m n is under going this reaction and part of the m n is undergoing normal propagation reaction.	539.9547304696953
They very they produced in small volumes , and we are not going to discuss much about conducting polymers.	527.6296153870724
A result of incorporation of a solid particle in a reaction mixture and particularly we consider a porous solid particle where most of the enzyme has been immobilized on the interior of the particle.	142.29069869038275
Now let us see i apply , this is stress or load.	324.41905947814803
This is 1 - f1, f1 is going to the reactor for mixing.	145.97193064676827
I am just moving it fast , because this just information i my aim is to just give you the generic synthetic procedure for this class of step polymers.	1196.4971357395746
Such a perception in the earlier days was based on a very limited understanding of the enzyme structure and function and the limited understanding was that people had looked at the stability of the enzyme in water miscible solvents say for example acetone which is still used for precipitation of enzyme proteins; it makes aggregates and precipitates; dioxanes which are water miscible solvents and beyond certain concentration of these solvents in the bulk medium inactivates the enzyme.	1704.776273489632
Is the ratio of the kinetic parameters to the diffusional parameters which is defined as.	124.79263727562052
That means it should be able to switch on and off the path way with a very subtle change in substrate concentration.	329.91433311658596
So , reactivity actually comes down very much.	209.17494836745593
How can , what are the types of side reactions.	194.34640322904642
The use of immobilization enzymes will lead to a heterogeneous catalysis.	50.35451920248848
If you go back here , each polymer segment , if all of these are , say for argument , all these neighboring cells has solvent molecules , and then it will have z contacts.	327.51754925349394
Some of the trade names are shown here.	12.825820286240187
So , actually the rate of , so net rate of polymerization would be rate of , polymers , propagation minus rate of depropagation.	209.8833942083285
Now we can apply clausius - clapeyron equation and write del p del t is del h vaporization by t v m; v m is molar volume and if you consider the vapor is the ideal gas , considering the ideal gas vapor we can do few mathematical steps to write.	2249.7406104424067
And also join the you can join this spinodal points and you can also join the inflection points to get something like this.	237.79748402730468
The mixed inhibition is a special case of non - competitive inhibition where otherwise substrate concentration does not influence the degree of inhibition.	52.41709156395194
The value of solubility parameter of the polymers can be also indirectly obtained from group contribution method.	130.43505165377815
So , huggins found out that k versus eta square is linear and pass through origin; k is the slope.	714.3758991380909
Now you think poly methylacrylate.	164.50530781687146
The structure of succinic acid is - ooc - ch2 - ch2 - coo -.	1080.665965347368
So , this is typically that is the difficulty in this technique.	106.95222060801697
Also this hydro peroxides; for example t - butyl hydro peroxide , it can also undergo homiletic cleavage forming two radicals.	556.0106972482232
You cannot determine m v for a unknown polymer by as such; you need to have a calibration curve and for doing calibration curve , you need to have 5, 6, 7, 8 known molecular weight narrow dispersed same polymer whose molecular weight you need to get it from the other absolute techniques like osmotic pressure or light scattering techniques.	630.3133932959058
At any other v value of b the rate profile will be a hyperbolic profile analogous to that of michaelis menten constant.	118.78039826329811
Now this cross a similar to the vapor liquid equilibrium of ideal liquid mixtures , so that is why , that is from where this name of ideal has come.	1620.2498319794547
I would like to introduce you to another method involving the use of cyanogen bromide not only from the point of view of preparing the immobilized enzyme preparation but it also has an additional property that is the cyanogen bromide method is used in the case of carriers that have hydroxyl groups.	402.33578641856974
And in other case of chain reaction you can do it with lower reaction temperature as well because the reactivity of these monomers are quite high.	155.687739254999
So , these are basically block copolymers , which have a long sequence of two different monomers.	66.65498249076634
So , the free volume because of this long chain is much more compared to the free volume produced by bulky groups having a spherical type shape or coil type shape.	664.1973022356127
Now , let us talk about a molecular weight in radical chain polymerization.	11.420694061650734
So , eta is the viscosity of the polymer solution , eta 0 is the viscosity of medium , and this phi 2 is the volume fraction of the polymer chain , so what we can easily show that , this expression would give this expression.	90.58005426406739
And that is , for amorphous polymer , obviously that should be highest temperature of usage because after that , the polymer becomes so soft that it cannot be useful.	329.7734370100212
A very accurate method which also has many other merits is in terms of lack of interference.	989.989764554856
So , what is done.	5.77802551417179
Here you have the active site , the sites on which the binding groups available on the substrate binds and this portion shows the substrate which is analogous to the key.	176.84738409677723
I just took few examples.	101.96133243702411
If i assume that your knowledge in polymer chemistry or other subject is related to the age , then you have some knowledge base.	674.9052571414575
So any face change , which involves any glass transaction or melting , which is endothermic processes , will require more heat , to maintain the temperature , and ideally this should be a sharp increase here.	1639.912942961771
In a chromatographic poly , these polystyrene columns are made by these , this cross linked polystyrene beads.	1038.0327831413051
Then you are sure in one thing that your km and vm values are somewhere in this range.	221.38071022315373
The second case again with respect to ternary complex formation is ordered ternary complex formation.	137.606496674373
Besides a macromolecule of various combinations of amino acids , the enzymes may also be considered as a catalyst.	129.31297111676292
I must again remind you that this is not a planar site.	217.08428367106114
Because each raft agent forms one radical , so we have to come include the concentration of the raft agent as well as initiator concentration.	411.2723131382361
It can even also be used along with , like your fiber entrapped enzymes , if the fibers are woven in the form of a cloth or thing like that so that you get a very large surface area in the form of a film , long film.	388.73556077752676
Hence there is tremendous effect of the solvent and the counters ion in case of ring opening polymerization as well , as was in the case of the linear ionic polymerization of the double bond.	213.44738789488957
Most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions involve more than one intermediate complex.	58.032840917678676
L , when.	168.9839462299844
Temperature also can control the degree of polymerization and all the parameters can be optimized for a given condition so that the maximum yield of the enzyme activity is recovered at the end of the reaction.	80.67441962842027
Which have initially started to make the mess.	3683.9497926020554
Very commonly encountered proteins are glycoproteins , many of the enzymes , particularly those which are isolated from eukaryotes , a glycoproteins which means that in addition to the amino acids the protein molecule is associated with an oligosaccharide , monosaccharide or an oligosaccharide , they could lipo proteins a lipid molecule , they could be nucleoproteins and a large number of proteins which are metalloproteins containing metal enzymes where the metal ions acts as a cofactor are known.	1242.2054726912297
So it will be k ln 1, again 0; number of different ways you can add in this solvent molecules , but unlike the ideal solution case s 2 is not equals to 0 here because the amorphous polymer chain has different confirmations and so you can actually arrange the polymer chain in different ways; not only one way like small molecules.	684.3177802146686
This film thickness will depend on various physical properties of the fluid.	139.79132659839513
Now , look at sum of the final sum of the polymers and solvent common solvent like acetone delta value 20.3 c c l 6, this example of take few polymer like polystyrene , this is some polymer polystyrene 18.5 and bis phenyl poly carbonate its around 19.5 to 2.	2132.950773355689
But in the case of immobilized enzyme you can repeatedly terminate by physically separating it.	138.14200548921735
In the first profile there is no peroxidase added which means as soon as the reaction starts the hydrogen peroxide produced inactivates the alcohol dehydrogenase and no further reaction takes place.	523.6489757971447
Now , as the chain grows , the possibility , the kinetic feasibility of the two functional groups present at the end coming and reacting to form ring , ring , comes down , which means , that k c comes down as a reaction progresses because the kinetic feasibility , that the longer the chain , that chances , that two end will come and react each other forming intra - molecular reaction , forming a ring , is always lower.	490.8498774505105
Similarly , we can do it for second concentration c 2 and get this value , get delta r theta excess rayleigh ratio at different angles; similarly , we get for the third solution.	497.47106495691776
It will , it will become like a sheet.	54.24928796453661
Let us take example.	6.178436847580606
You can compare between the values between m a and m m a.	100.43533910135079
L / p and therefore the value of kappm gets altered by a factor of.	369.2384841052431
If strain is not developed it will remain in the binding site but not at the active site.	211.1743331333607
So we will come back and start in the next lecture from this redox , the other example of redox initiators.	49.293762572547436
The negative and positive charges are equal.	163.29902715835334
Instead of equilibrium behavior they mentioned in the case of rate terms a steady state behavior.	145.50739814769014
But , this is , this thermal induced self initiation is not a very common and solution for styrene; so , this is very specific case for styrene.	440.9216395807118
Very sharp change in substrate concentration can bring in the regulation.	656.0687914576084
So , this is the transfer constant for chain transfer constant for monomer , this is chain transfer constant for the initiator , similarly for solvent , we can write c s solvent by m plus c cta , cta by m.	199.21588936113275
Now , this two can be polymerized to give you a poly styrene co mma , this is a copolymer of poly styrene and methyl methacrylate.	120.19581336203001
So , it is a serial process.	47.84931514997713
And , is typically the initiator efficiencies , initiator efficiencies lie around say 0.3 to 0.8, which means that the , among all the radical species which are generated around 30 percent to 80 percent of the radicals , actually generate or initiate a chain polymers.	782.8798388443694
So , p is very close to 2, at most if your polymer molecular is low , it can be little lower than .	176.61838878291883
It is a two stage ester exchange process , first stage dimethyl terephthalicd m t is reacted with excess of ethylene glycol at say around moderate temperature and methanol is distilled out to form this compound.	2496.54998845857
When they are placed in a reactor how do they influence the performance of the system.	120.88192475579048
So , number of initiator residues per chain , per polymer chain is 6 by 4 is 1..	203.7906792160485
Ds / dx is negative and this is output of the substrate from the pore.	240.34081501926494
So , the most used co - catalyst is mao which is a methylaluminoxane , which is network compound of this.	500.2518520362509
Monomers , we talked about several times monomers.	814.2551838375236
The specificity in fact has both negative as well as positive role.	1297.8556472336509
So , that we can get a molecular distribution; similarly , if we have ri plus viscosity then viscosity real time gives the eta value and then we can use the inverse of calibration curve to find out this molecular weight distribution.	199.73039702182336
And the commonly these are called i will show you the example in the next slide , if you have co these are called polyketones and specifically this structure is called poly ether ether ketones and simple this called polyether ketone , you have if you have a sulfonegroup so 2 group in here then these are polysulfones.	2211.4139736418238
Second parameter , which is responsible for permeability is the solubility , and solubility of a gas in a polymer depend upon , the chemically affinity between gas , and the polymer we are talking about; that depends upon the solubility parameter of the gas , and the polymer metals , we discussed earlier , when we discussed the polymer solutions , we talked about the solubility parameter.	302.5701238398335
So , you can say that whether the other functional group , it present in other end of the molecule , whether that is reacted or not , that does not determine the reactivity of the other side , as the function group is in other side.	89.47959999174167
We will let me drive the draw the mechanism in a separate page.	133.51842837969244
The third and perhaps a very simplistic example is of the hydrolysis of starch for the production of glucose.	197.96079772847318
Simply this aibn type molecule also can absorb photon and break into 2 radicals.	1545.8774851843875
It is a very specific configuration which has been reported and has been used industrially and this system has been used extensively for immobilized enzyme preparations which are in the form of thin films.	116.0526240861016
Many of the kinetic analysis in the early stages when i say early stages i am referring to the late 18th century or early 19th century when people tried to understand the kinetic behavior and i think one of the earliest recorded interpretations or results of the kinetic analysis of enzyme was by o sullivian and tompson as early as 189.	1147.5806545856135
L is greater than two f is equal to 1 /.	8.194237030406303
It gives you a much increased activity and that is the major advantage.	47.10582552141494
Rather , if the polymer chain can be initiated , polymer chains can be broken at some , some place and you get a radical or some active center , the polymers will depropagate , unzip to form monomers , so that the free monomer concentration goes up and gives you the equilibrium monomer concentration.	289.3786544952505
So , you have synthesized in this way a unsaturated polyester.	60.55554112486376
So the total bed multiplied by the voidage will give a fluid volume in the reactor.	261.85066365588835
How many number of radicals has initiated polymer chains , that 6 moles so that is 10.	849.3478534689928
So , with this , i come to the conclusion of this course and thank you , for being with me with this course and good luck to you.	742.1308053412629
And he also should know that why in reality pdi always end up being slightly higher than two because of side reaction cyclization.	2375.7756068822305
That means if there is a particular state of ionization of the active site of the amino acid involved , whatever fraction of the enzymes present in that fraction will constitute the catalytically functional enzyme.	204.90473656042874
That means , you must be expecting a high molecular weight you have got a low molecular weight polymers.	91.06756693575684
You can immobilize the whole cell as long as you do not inactivate other contaminating enzymes in the cell which will interfere in the process.	248.95382769157274
Now days , these are not practiced.	248.9911043210868
The significance of co - operative binding lies in actual practice in the case of allosteric enzymes.	88.67314670500788
The chemical species which needs to be analyzed is anylate.	59.63784005937135
So , even if at high conversion , the length of the polymer chain or the oligomer chains are quite high.	57.23145927664353
One is that enzymes have binding sites for substrate molecule.	154.46025286087598
You can also conclude that the faster reactions will have a smaller value of e *.	165.57780420316632
The cost of the carrier and the regeneration capacity are directly linked.	83.00615286948478
So , if we just go back and see what we have seen , now we know the entropy of mixing of a polymer solution and polymer plus solvent is truly , now in this case , the entropy is truly a combinatorial entropy.	137.4233984346459
You will get something like this; almost a typical profile as we discussed earlier that it becomes convex to 1 / sb; 1 / v.	426.101524015865
You can get a thermodynamic picture of the enzyme substrate binding and also you will notice that the interaction on the x - axis will give you.	127.86307278885366
So , from this expression also you can predict that the polymer solvent interaction parameter will be lower than 0.5, which means the polymer will promote or it will dissolve in the solvent you are using.	59.531801624683204
So it doesn t meet the requisite commercial requirements.	544.0072199804816
There are certain general patterns which we follow in studying reversible inhibition and before we go to the individual cases i like to highlight that.	567.444786023896
A similar profile is observed in the case of conversion of pyruvate to alanine using same polyacrylamide hydrazide coupled nad and formate dehydrogenase and alanine dehydrogenase.	979.6295502583788
I think we will now stop at this point.	23.912169391963733
How did you define the degree of polymerization is the number of structure unit.	114.07631424725771
Dt k1e0 s ( k1s + k - 1 + k2 ) x if you just solve it you will get a logarithmic term and the solution will be ln [ k1e0s - ( k1s + k - 1 + k2 ) x ] = t + a - ( k1s + k - 1 + k2 ) let us say alpha is the constant for integration.	450.9796676963297
So , the original definition of addition and condition polymers are modified and now , the condensation polymers are polymers where you have a functional group like this z , where z could be any of this.	79.39698970593108
So , the amount of energy required to break this bar is called impact strain.	87.73450170054271
So , in this spectra corresponds to 1 styrenic munity , and 4 point may be about 4.28 mma munity , which means the composition percentage of mma is 4.28 1 plus 4.28 into 100, which gives around 8.	3865.9838599638942
Langmuir isotherm is based on a theoretical development.	1953.6406787605974
If you assume that there is some kind of deviation from ideality and in the case of cstr the kind of deviation could be of two types.	60.89507369157986
But , if you compare the other alternative , which is shown here.	22.067284238697788
R p also you know this k p mm dot.	703.519491514764
This binding energy can be of the order of about 10 - 15 kcalmol - 1 at 25c and if you take the two reactants at one molar concentration , the computation will tell that it will be about 10 - 15 kcalmol - .	248.05327980733418
So , now , we basically know these are the mechanism of zeigler - natta polymerization.	25.269960843758533
So , you may require high temperature , so this are typical not used commercially this two reactions are not used commercially.	582.2790729720673
Therefore i think one should very clearly understand the relationship between fractional conversion , enzyme quantity required or the space time and productivity.	333.36953366418976
And , another example of photodegradation of polycarbonate; if you take bpa polycarbonate and keep it outside , for 1 to 1 and a half hours , it turns yellow and becomes hazy and brittle of that time.	1796.7287752355533
Now this significant amount , fix amount is basically is prefixed.	1695.6829319155881
So finally , delta r s by c at c is equal to 0 will give you the k r s which is this k for the resistance by m n.	346.9715418193045
So , for making a polymers you require monomers which have at least two functionality in them.	470.78391802586947
The conventional use of enzymes in therapeutic has been the use of proteases.	786.630146867249
That is what you see in a diagrammatic picture like here.	100.04945665909939
Just to give few data for polymer solvent polymer solvent system having different values of i and theta let us look at some data of different polymers and with different solvents as we are mentioning , for all this cases the interaction parameter value chi is less than 0..	1232.5012964769921
This is followed by partial ionization of this olefin as well as this alkyl bridge.	1344.4997951403684
At the end of gpc experiment , we get a detector response and with the illusion volume.	87.15646481726445
Now , once the h o thermic reaction happen , if we do not have arrangements to take out that heat which his evolve chain the reaction , then there will be change in temperature.	88.02790883839317
You get a slope of - km and the intercept on the y axis is vm itself.	121.93226016883511
If you compare taking to different groups , where they are this electron deficient and this is electron rich , then they will tend to be forming alternate copolymers.	239.97824633322162
So , between this three processes thermal process redox process and photochemical processes.	750.2154894540499
In dilute polymer solution we had found that the excess contribution excess chemical potential , we got this relationship.	465.62439031125723
Now from this fluctuation of the scatter intensity which we can apply techniques; this is like dynamic light scattering which take advantage of this fluctuation and we can get information about hydrodynamic radius for the polymer molecules and the time average intensity which we will use in the techniques called static light scattering which will give the information about absolute molecular weight , weight average molecular weight , the radius of gyration and the second semiempirical coefficient which will in turn give the information about polymer solvent interaction parameter.	309.000699136719
So , final state is a non - equilibrium state.	81.65294958374739
Now , it is very difficult.	5.087440904425361
You can clearly see , that with increase in temperature , here temperature goes up , this values of transfer coefficient , transfer constant goes up and if this transfer constant goes up , that means , what will happen.	99.80492103371805
And , also this k 3 is the; the value of k 1, k 2 and k 5, they have much higher value compared to k .	405.370808619332
Oh plus h , it gives you 1.	3102.648974647027
And because you are continually stirring this actually stabilized the suspension , so the poly.	918.6448912368509
Right; only z1; you don t bother about z.	13796.00587571975
Except to understand their role to evolve methods to prevent the poisoning they don t have much of industrial value.	1028.8623473941807
Mind it the reaction binding of b from e is not possible in the ordered mechanism.	776.9969430995226
That means the average number of radicals in 1 particle is half , because the probability of finding 1 radical and no radical is same , so probability of finding 1 radical is or the average number of radical is half.	530.2087493630706
And also if your , the sample is having a larger refractive index then , as a result of higher reflection value , your gloss will be also higher , how do you measure gloss.	1193.9094296180388
But both the products are crosslinked preparations and are useful.	1231.400972458934
They are somewhere between the continuous stirred tank reactors and the plug flow reactors and if you put the substrate feed at a speed high enough to lift the bed or fluidize the bed but not allow the catalyst particle to go out of the reactor , unlike in the case of a packed bed there is a static bed of the immobilized enzyme particles and the linear velocity of the feed is not large enough so that the bed can be disturbed.	247.12248250173707
I think we will stop here and continue to discuss the behavior of enzyme reactors.	41.231517444646684
And as i said that , i will be mainly i will be discussing the mechanical properties in in details , basic some basic terms in , when you talk about mechanical properties , stress you know that , it is force divided by the area upon which the force acts.	438.58719426282204
So , we can write d eta s p by c by d c; this is the slope k that is proportional linear.	597.7658265474719
Therefore he mentioned that the rate of break down of e - s and rate of formation of e - s are probably the same and e - s remains under steady state.	101.1877625830041
In the case of mixed inhibition they are not identical but they have a magnitude and both are related by ratio of a and which determines the degree of inhibition.	102.33073021561005
But initial autolysis of the cell increases gives some.	1880.6507982240591
So , you can have reactions happening in both the , propagation happening in both the sides.	193.77998146317566
Now , before we come to this lectures topic , let us just recapitulate what we have learnt in last lecture.	114.75628503425425
The difference is that in the case of acid base catalysis there is no covalent bond formation.	64.15984417789961
So , in all the cases , it will produce the same radical.	29.287511518980416
So , we can write rate of polymerization divided by rate of initiation , now at steady state we knew that we know by this time , that r i is equals to the rate of termination.	51.41235825911639
These reversible inhibitors are often categorized into three major classes based on certain general features and some of the general features which are used to classify them are : one is pattern of binding of the inhibitor to either the enzyme molecule or the enzyme substrate complex or in another words it leads to specific mechanistic steps which are involved in the inhibitory effect.	433.71109781475946
Then we have a number of enzymes which show stereo chemical specificity.	194.798105082813
So , without going much into the theory of light scattering , let us go into the theory directly into the equations for the light scattering from dilute polymer solutions.	531.4751278293351
Now the key issue is that all these functions in the living cell , may it be a microbial cell , may it be a plant cell or it might be an animal cell , they are mediated by the catalyst known as enzymes.	1588.0757174998957
On the other hand there is an optimum water concentration which is required but when water is produced water has to be removed rather being added.	690.0136655978431
Remember the expression for the atip.	246.55562731871643
I think you may like to go through and i suggest some of the references; you just go through them; you will find the experimental details as to how they arrived at the final decisions.	2383.6828697420387
There could be the other differences as well and this is not , at not , as temperature sensitive , as cationic polymerization.	391.69897067746376
So , if we , we can plot m versus e versus 1 over t c and from the slope we can , if you know this , by experimental process we can get this values from the slope and interest rate is , so if we know these values we can get the value for del s and del h.	149.03865527920254
Those cases we can term those polymers as semi - synthetic or semi - natural in any of the ways.	647.1564858194864
One international unit of enzyme is the quantity of that enzyme or the concentration of that enzyme which can convert one micro mole of substrate into product in unit time per minute.	181.2236855410873
But turn over number for most of the enzyme catalyzed reaction varies in the order from 10 - 104 per second.	286.0839287711078
Common technique to study the amino acid residues or identify the amino acid residues at the enzyme active site is by chemical modification of the different function of the groups that are present.	218.08871729815857
Now , typically e transfer is higher than e p , so which means , that with t , with increase in , decrease in temperature c also goes down , which means , x n goes up.	105.77428437057856
R p 1 is given by k p 1, m 1 dot , m plus , r 2 is given by k p 2, m 2 dot , m plus , so on; and , this r p n is given by k p n , m n dot , m.	101.78212445567355
Now we said , that when we talk about homo polymers , now we can have only limited , number of homo polymers you know , we always using , if you have noticed same names basically coming , every time polystyrene , polyaclonoidal , polygon acetate , polymethyl like.	969.2139704728337
We are considering this parameter the.	184.80228654777946
And , these degradation is accelerated by , in presence of light , heat , oxygen and presence of acids.	108.58620050239394
So , at the level of 100 degrees of polymer , what do you have in this reaction medium.	25.21316614583542
In most cases it is true and that is why even the dissociation constant concept is feasible.	257.39184108932943
For example , if we are talking about two blocks , then , if they are not miscible to each other or other way invisible to each other , then you have two phases.	85.40992776312343
They must be able to tolerate it and the enzyme must be available when you say yield i am referring to a term which incorporates the cost part; because higher the yield , the cost can be lower.	207.1703108257965
So you get the hexamethylene diamine derivative of the cellulose where you have already separated the matrix by six ch2 groups.	799.7032502069475
They can in a because in a , they have two defined functional group at both the sides.	407.63740760750574
These are exception; few exceptions , rather than a regular case.	359.4167407334418
Obviously , we know that with increasing crystalinity , the modulus and strength goes up , whereas with a if we cross link this material with cross linking , the modulus goes up.	99.76554007512993
But if you have a cationic initiator for this case , and if you have a.	9.950471384369832
So , you can imagine that this polymer coiled solvent is like a impermeable sphere , which consists of the polymer coil and the solvent molecules , which are associated with the polymer chain.	111.4085821090351
If you just compare the two kinds of profiles , this is a sigmoidal profile and this is the hyperbolic profile.	147.7333076181056
Some of the reagents are soluble in aqueous medium , some are insoluble in aqueous medium and you require a non - aqueous or a more non - polar medium.	137.32679915774227
So , if basically if you know the solvents and the value of polycarbonate you can predict , you can estimate the whatever , whatever you want to know which application.	351.4388875690641
It will behave in a different way.	42.66148435216717
Kf if this sb / j is the main flux taking into account both external film diffusion as well as internal pore diffusion and the first factor 1 / kl is resistance provided by external film diffusion and the second expression is a resistance term due to pore diffusional limitations then the overall effect is a sum of these two resistances and sb / j will be the flux which will really be expressed in the case of a reactor performance which experiences both film diffusion as well as internal pore diffusion.	583.4213533686141
There will be a fall in the oxygen concentration , dissolved oxygen concentration which will be monitored by the electrode and this fall in dissolved oxygen concentration under steady state will be proportional to the substrate concentration.	340.6428459498999
So , this is the linear region where the polymers get separated.	145.45289692229943
The solvents must be chosen in such that if you evaporate quickly to give a uniform mixture of the polymer matrix and the salt should quickly evaporate and give the salt.	1344.0987408019716
You have continuous stirred tank reactor and the classical feature of a continuous stirred tank reactor is it is a type of a stirred reactor in which you give a continuous supply of substrates in the form of feed and the same volume at the same rate the product stream is taken out while retaining the immobilized enzyme preparation in the reactor stream.	227.4690544786281
So , r p 1 plus , r p 2 plus , r p 3 plus , r p n plus , so on.	548.9560601069879
The side chains are also free to interact with each other and provide you electrostatic interactions and other features.	1038.1242337262463
So , what happened.	3.5417084613250314
Now , x - ray is very small in compared to a visible light which is having 400 nanometer to 800 nanometer , it is about only 0.1 nanometer whereas , the neutron is about 0.1 nanometer to 2 nanometer.	2257.7415857329333
Either inhibitor has to bind to the enzyme or the substrate has to bind to the enzyme.	30.44493809945374
The concentration in the starting material is of the order of about one kg per meter cube which is significant enough to recover and you don t require for the most cases a very high degree of purity and therefore their cost is also reasonably low say for example about thousand us dollars per kg.	377.8609345970427
So , you have this now this will again react with another monomer in similar way.	51.02770445574476
That means a very physical conceptual picture of effectiveness factor can be considered.	88.56002841463096
Similarly one can express the co - operativity index of any given allosteric enzyme by expressing it in terms of the ratio of substrate concentration for achieving two different levels of reaction velocity.	503.2765712095768
And if you need additives , invariably we need really , that the 100 percent polymer is used for any formulation.	670.9868710911923
Isomerases are another important catalyst of industrial enzymes which isomerises one molecule into other isomerable molecule.	9458.002412531385
Now , we will only see the mechanism of polymerization.	70.3813904076518
And it could be some inorganic particles as well which we which can absorb on the monomer particle size.	417.68996468643195
They are based on platinum cathode and a silver anode which is immersed in saturated kcl which is separated from the test solution by a ptfe membrane.	954.9961684274629
You know all the term here , f r p plus 1 minus r p square and at r is equal to 1, p is .	573.7634392244399
You conduct the enzyme catalyzed reaction in a buffered medium with different ph values and get the reaction rate and use the one which has the maximum value.	321.3551266120866
We will now determine on the number of polymer molecules present in the solution; number of polymer molecules , which will give you m n , because m n is what concerns the number of polymer molecules.	165.27961397758114
So , it has become very difficult.	26.206169711639532
You will notice that it is analogues to your michaelis menten kinetics.	31.39308520466125
We had also seen earlier the factors that affect the choice of different reactor types and to recall some of the factors that we had talked about the most important ones are listed here like form of the enzyme.	578.0712650958708
Even if you allow for a long period the loading is usually not uniform.	248.17483830399425
They need to be considered in isolation one by one and depending upon the information we want to collect.	360.5627514341435
A very simple example of this approach was reported by hicks and updike way back in 6.	1335.6595489594522
You will get a straight line because slope will be equal to slope = km / vm ( 1 + i / ki ) therefore one can determine the value or magnitude of ki either by plotting the slope verses the inhibitor concentration or by intercept.	114.13967712791327
For example , if you are adding some additives for some medical application , then the additives should not come out and contaminate the medical devices.	163.58607529893632
So , all the disadvantage of the bulk polymers should not be present here because you are doing in a small small volumes and small droplets and because its present in a in a surrounded by aqueous medium.	356.55698055928553
No other excess sugar is acted upon by such an enzyme.	203.49948909552106
Obviously , this is the negative term and there is a negative sign here , so this is a positive term.	232.98632058659712
The pka is different and ionization will totally depend on the pka value of the functional group.	253.97351094481903
So , if you talking about copolymerization the values r will change with the different types of initiators , medium polarity and temperature.	172.0159360190793
So , what happen that the radical will go in small number of micelles which will grow , and form particles surrounded by the surfactant.	233.80035512009016
Very often even after the immobilized enzyme preparation has been exhausted during use the carrier can be recovered and reused.	197.65958982292523
We will not go into very details into derivation.	314.571668405225
The pressure drop will continuously keep on increasing.	171.1305737315093
One is syndiotactic and atactic formation and from experiment data we get this around minus 4 to minus 8 kilo joule per mole and this we get around 0 to 4 joule per mole.	1043.7125837798633
It will also depend on the porosity on the carrier.	41.51169539674118
With this i we will stop this class.	407.4872897261221
But the l l dash can be same or different; from different metallocenes like cyclopentadienyl or indenyl or fluorenyl.	5066.67215164543
Say , for example , this one , case one; if we take a water vapor and then the water , just consider water , liquid water and then cool it down.	877.5337565212127
All these are constants.	25.18059085977472
So , pore size might vary from very low to moderately high and they are packed with having beads of diameter of 5 micron to 10 micron.	2206.6866916866657
Because the substrate will be consumed and as the substrate progresses through the particle depth the concentration will be dropping down and there are two possibilities.	446.0923171631239
And at some points they converge so this point this is critical points is given by critical points is given by convergence of the points of common tangency and inflection points.	863.3661516176508
Basically , these are not the polymers you want you want polymers which are as narrower as possible.	138.22091797882086
It is used in the oxidation reduction reactions and in the absence of any such residue in the active site which can participate in the oxidation reduction reaction , the nad provides a molecule which undergoes redox reaction and therefore catalyzes the reaction.	500.5514079778414
When the come in the water vapour come in contact with this surface , they actual form a thin flame of water , which does not interfere with the light , such a way , that it basically gives any reduction in the visibility through this plastic material or it does not decrease the transparency of this plastic material.	559.2353518346964
Now , let us talk about the molecular weight distribution in case of radical polymerization.	7.225080633101256
Now , let us first understand , why we need to add additives in polymers.	93.81675527324286
This is just to illustrate the point so that the system does not become complex immediately and we will be able to appreciate.	238.8938724140137
You need to design enzyme reactors which can take care of transfer of materials; transport of energy , transport of momentum and all transport processes can be taken care.	711.9148313152798
So , you can simply write f 1 is r 1 f 1, plus f 1 f 2 or f 1 by f 2 is.	498.3646871740992
Now , what could be reason between the difference in this tendency of the solvent towards different monomers , again as we discussed in the last lecture if this propagating radical is very reactive.	251.98213213166972
Pvc plasticized means it by adding some additives which are called as plasticized t g is brought down.	1747.2735948469706
Here it is the low energy of activation as a result of catalyst and this indicates the high energy of activation in the absence of any catalyst.	283.1989252488238
Now in this polymerization , chain polymerization monomers are , monomer is present throughout , but it concentration decreases gradually or steadily , and we also know that in , during this chain polymerization we have only monomer , or high molecular rate polymers.	274.1454317295618
So , how many number; this is number of cells already occupied by the polymer segments.	62.458948092773255
What is the ph.	25.79646413241152
The energy is generated to the required level; materials are stored in case they are not needed.	1385.9543479450194
Next terms we be discussion about reflection and gloss; reflect reflectivity is defined as the ratio of the intensity of reflected light , to the incident light.	787.5901994539345
On the other hand in the case of pfr the corresponding relationship is kd . t = ln s0x0 - km ln ( 1 - x0 ) / s0x0 - km ln ( 1 - xt ) here also you can consider the effect of the operational stability on the reactor performance.	35.606576586394475
Now the initially what happened.	74.80316135105716
That is the effect of ph as far as the ionization of enzyme active sites are involved.	37.16447878587648
This under steady state conditions must be same as the rate of a reaction and that is v = k2e0ss / km + ss if you substitute the magnitude of the ss from this expression and simplify you get k2e0 [ sb - v / klam ] v = km + [ sb - v / klam ] the steady state rate of reaction will be given by this expression and the ss will be equal to sb - rn or v / klam and therefore and 1 / v will be equal to 1 / v = km / k2e0 ( 1 / sb - v / klam ) + 1 / k2e0 that gives you the 1 / v if you consider the extreme conditions , that is when sb is very high or we are considering zero order regime.	243.21988463451888
In the third case , in the case of cell growth , the mannose model of microbial cell growth it is a substrate which is a ligand just like enzymes but the matrix is the cell mass itself and it reflects the transport of substrate into the cell.	657.0005998339918
We know the transducer to utilize the selective analysis of a biochemical species in a sample.	814.6906606117698
So , if the if the reaction between the one monomer with the phosgene is faster , then it will be a blocky copolymer.	189.2814464389313
And if it is a copolymer what is the composition , what is the , what is the sequence of monomer present in the monomer in the polymer and we know what is the molecular weight of the polymer.	20.26062305362977
This will depend upon two factors one is the source of the enzyme and the purity of the enzyme.	47.51480225804398
This is just a summary of the whole thing.	25.949521430419455
The intermediate regime is that where km and s0 are of comparable value.	1850.9976443068126
How the weight fraction distribution varies with molecular weight.	62.407980222097876
And miscible polymer blend is a mixture of polymers , which are homogeneous at molecular level.	113.63797405542627
So basically in the instrument , we try to detect the scatterings only from the solute molecule in this case the polymer molecule in a dilute solution so that there are not much intermolecular interactions and we deduct the scattering which we detect for or determine from a solute solution from the solvent so that we can get the information of on scattering from only from the solute molecules.	392.6690917213855
This is nothing but sort of plasticizing effect.	204.39452377305807
Plasticizers are nothing but small molecules which basically dissolve in the polymer matrices and like the solvent or some added molecules.	708.6734681900266
We talked about selectivity of the monomers with about the importance of solvent polarity in case of ionic polymerization.	165.68071149944726
As soon as you go to 0.9 conversion , the relative quantity of enzyme required is 1.95; almost about one and half times.	174.22459520153959
Now , m e you can get , again t is given , t c is given , so that is your temperature reaction.	259.1855894305191
So , this statistically does not have any significance in terms of final polymer product , in terms of their molecular weight or molecular distribution.	229.91927377919566
If you have a lactone give you poly ester if you have a lactum , it will cyclo lactum it will give you a linear poly amide molecules.	458.24875718357305
We know that in case of thermal polymerization r p is given by k p m f k d i k t half.	66.32650557379765
The constant which briggs and haldane proposed was not developed by michaelis and menten.	1315.2882065952354
And this d z is equal to this quantity where k is the boltzmann constant , t is the temperature , f 0 is we can get from stokes equation , 6 pie eta 0 r h where r h is the hydrodynamic volume; perform this we can get if we know eta 0 and the temperature , and value of this from this dynamic light scattering correlation.	1066.5939683109775
It is not going.	89.32559521479307
Now , basically we have covered almost all possibilities of different combination of r 1 and r 2 values.	339.65990138539115
Practically it may be difficult to consider all these effects in one go because sometimes they may be counteracting and so the net effect of what we notice is a very complex phenomenon , all over.	914.4719840305947
So , from this reaction you are getting the , this is .	30.302003405479493
So , though this is a natural polymer , but if we imagine monomers like this from which they are formed and in this case because you imagine or you hypothesized that these are formed to a condensation reaction , most of this natural polymers are classified as a condensation polymer.	232.75923800172018
But for small molecules which have all the molecules have same molecular weight fragmentation does not matter , because the highest molecular ion will represents the molecular or will give the molecular weight for the small molecule or the molecules; but in case of polymer , one polymer sample consist of many chains of different lengths or different molecular weight.	246.53692997935775
If you consider the slopes and the intercepts of this plot , a replot of the slope will give you ki.	534.2720043994516
If the middle thing is the ionisable form , then you can also predict that the left hand side form of the enzyme eh2 is more reduced form than the eh and then eh is more reduced than e.	2276.1476692984083
If it is 0.99, there will be 99 percent of the functional groups are reacted , then you get 10.	514.7440456940843
But , time being glass transition is a temperature at which a polymer becomes soft below which polymer become glassy.	323.10667285588653
It s a very small area on the total enzyme surface and rest of the enzyme surface either in its proximity provides some favorable reactions or very often it may be considered as only a sort of building framework structural feature which creates the active site.	861.1016171190256
So basically that tells you , that the number of options in copolymer , if number of co polymers can be synthesis is unlimited.	901.6161090433859
Or s0.5 substrate concentration for 50 % maximum reaction velocity is nvk.	738.1074541131061
So , we want to discuss about other thermal behavior , with of all the polymer behavior with temperature.	82.15978708688633
For a soluble enzyme you cannot use a plug flow reactor.	40.714960336922296
The substrate concentration drops and ultimately depending upon the extent of conversion which we require , the product concentration increases.	232.9333664848896
Hydrolysis of pen g or v goes to six apa and the six apa is an intermediate for variety of antibiotics , the semi synthetic antibiotic and they are commonly used.	1664.3181176647
Now , you have seen , now it can undergo hydride elimination and form an ionic end.	168.7826548379766
The most commonly used method of cross linking the enzyme molecules is by the use of glutaraldehyde which possesses two aldehyde groups separated by a hydrocarbon chain , the three ch2 groups.	257.99367459772776
This is what happened for acetone and acetonitrile is a theta solvent for the temperature where this temperature for pmma which means the pi by c will be independent of the concentration of the solution.	353.43957548123404
The measurement of activation energy is also used as a kind of a experimental data to check whether the system is diffusion limited or not.	350.5734649814842
If , if you have monomers , which , whose ceiling temperature , like alpha methyl styrene , alpha methyl styrene , which are very few where , whose ceiling temperature is very low , then you cannot just use this as such , then you have to consider the depolymerization reaction as well.	178.08199475859678
Instead 15 kcalmol - 1 involved in binding of the normal molecule for the three bonds , you will require only thirteen.	1843.3408276724688
Now once you have a 1, 4 addition between cis and trans , if you just consider what is the possible structure of the monomer itself.	265.80519877827237
Then you can control your molecular weight and you can target your molecular weight by adjusting the ratio between two monomer or the fixing the value of r.	313.680001376719
There are certain enzymes which are highly specific and exhibit absolute specificity.	117.33808174604827
Or in other words in place of turn over number k2 that appear in the case of michaelis menten kinetics you put the rate limiting rate constant in this sequence of interaction in the enzyme substrate or in the enzyme kinetics and that will still be valid.	446.74423448178607
So , what happens to the molecular weight if you plot molecular weight versus time.	248.09982654269365
So , next move to the ir spectroscopy , and as i mentioned , we will just mention the basic things about the spectroscopy , and then move to the application polymer science.	190.15574724609726
So , using very high energy radiation sources , we can apply or we can generate a radical , which can initiate the radical polymerization reaction.	66.83781324050271
Now , what is metallocene polymerization.	76.65462497803662
This functional group has to be active or the reaction should be feasible under conditions which are mild in the sense that they are usually very close to the ambient conditions.	520.0732735921384
If there is enzyme which is intercellular and the recovery or purification cost is very high probably immobilized cells will provide an answer.	2194.740867252189
They have regular structures; obviously , isotactic will be having more regular than symbiotic structure.	1516.0272402983894
So , that is , that is good.	16.550747379279862
So , i can write this q , instead of phi 1 x n 2 phi 1 x n 2, i can write z minus 2 n 1 phi .	170.39478970556794
Right . diazonium derivative will have n triple bond n.	983.2256337066681
So , that when the molecular weight becomes infinity , x n becomes infinity , that means , basically , you have the entire molecular polymers unfrosting to each other.	210.26137698203692
If you denote this function as f df / dh + = 1 / kb ka / ( h + ) 2 = 0 if you equate it to zero you get 1 / kb = ka / ( h + ) 2 hydrogen ion concentration gives you this function f to be a minimum.	1236.7753917114649
If you want to find out these , you have to know all these rate constant - k p 1, k p 2, k p n , k p 3, k p 4, and all this things; that is practically impossible.	322.95326925923746
That for self catalyzed reaction x n bar is 1 plus 2 n square k t , where n 0 is the concentration of the monomeric species at beginning , whereas for external catalyzed reaction , we got x n is 1 plus n 0 k dash t.	142.75595979874717
At the end , all these carbolic liquid will be consumed and you will land up a polymer or oligomer chain with both sides amine groups.	387.8359689957056
It should be rigid if you want to isolate these polymers as a bead then it should be rigid and it should not stick to each other.	116.3437944207937
This is dx the length of differential element.	432.6407933105751
Now , if i want to measure the light scattering from a polymer solution; as you know , the light scattering is dominated by the molecules having larger sizes or larger molecular weight.	156.024500843662
This is the approach what we are taking; we will add the polymers one by one and for single polymers we will add each segment one after one.	451.13629734937865
So because of the effective concentration fluctuation , the light scattering happens from the polymer of the solute molecules.	300.83745381975194
From this then you can write down rate of reaction as equal to v = k3 [ eab ] if you look at the original rate expression the product is being formed.	293.5169773240762
For example site directed mutagenesis is what happens if an amino acid is removed and another amino acid is inserted in the polymeric chain that is in the protein chain.	504.7104524013141
So , you get a half here , a additional half.	174.03293253401887
Another feature is first we must pay attention to those enzymes which are already available in bulk quantities.	193.6332058147522
But if you take a little more realistic case that instead of having one amino acid residue , we have two amino acid residues or two ionisable residues there might be more than two other amino acid residues which are involved in the active site but they may be non - polar.	218.86080793042566
Now intrinsic viscosity; if you compare this two expressions then we can write this m v is.	390.57500111104247
So , you know how esters are named.	266.5007241726885
If you consider this as a pure monomer , if you fix this concentration pure monomer as this goes down t c goes down.	127.85102168322807
The analogy lies that the reactions that are catalyzed by the enzymes in a living cell if they are carried out in an industrial atmosphere with perfect energetically economical situation , environmentally friendly conditions we have a good friend in enzymes and that is again another basis of use of enzymes in the process industries and also the possibility of studying them in such a great detail.	720.1787836861894
In those cases they produce lactose free milk by the action of beta galactosidase on milk which hydrolyses the lactose into galactose and glucose.	1212.990545815534
How to approach the situation incase if the flow behavior is not ideal interms of perfectly well back mix or a plug flow behavior.	800.0236450141585
So at the interface of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomer they polymerize and the enzyme gets entrapped into and these microcapsules are very fine in size.	1252.1780299423565
So , sometimes this this polymerization is called powder or granular polymerization.	288.93728596679983
So , this assumption which we made for ideal solution is not valid here; the sizes are solvent molecules and solute molecules.	338.41995660184415
That is the conventional , internationally accepted unit of an enzyme activity.	133.77256858628667
So , if the length of the branch is higher than the entanglement molecular weight , then you call that as a long chain branch , how you characterize or define the sort of gives the parameter , describe the branching; obviously , the branched for same given molecular weight , if you have same molecular weight , because the branches the size , radius of gyration will be lower as you can expect.	353.82088140049564
How do you determine this molecular weight.	14.272621662405445
Take for example a cofactor like a nad.	301.4140611420634
The same process follows on the reverse of reaction that means eab * under goes break down into products whereby instead of product directly being formed it forms ep , the enzyme bound to the product , the enzyme product complex and then this ep again breaks down to the next level of your product which is same as of the uncatalyzed reaction.	1167.2244162633165
Also the effectiveness problem can be more serious when substrates of low diffusivities are to be processed.	3987.28797436228
Obviously this here , because of short range steric interaction is lower , this will be much stable , much more stable than this is conformation where the short range steric interactions are higher between the two methyl group.	916.50360988228
So , often we need catalyst to make the reaction feasible.	93.1825501244788
So , delta r for isotropic scatterer is angle independent.	261.03810152979213
They are known in the trade name of ultem , there amorphous t g is as high as 215 degree centigrade and there are constant use temperature is between 18 170 to 18.	949.3173534347675
And compare this vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate , which is basically as we have known from our earlier discussions done in several times.	1491.3292064709267
Now if this is a 1, 2 addition , then we will get a polymer like this.	46.497287824326776
So , if the polymer while vaporization is gets fragmented or degraded then while we get the molecular ion distribution , we do not know the distribution is because of the fragmentation or degradation of the high polymer chain or because of the actual presence of the low molecular weight chain in the samples.	320.9907793865991
So , it is also low density.	24.405263726670906
So , from this calibration curve we can easily convert this elution volume to log molecular weight data.	111.59003318416698
Another property of the enzymes in terms of proteins is their solubility.	280.86782801871016
So , it contribute negatively it favors the mixing process , so in theta conditions still the mixing is possible favorable and you get a soluble mixture of polymer and solvent.	579.9197053027732
Because , this is highly reactive , it will react both m and this , if it is less reactive , then the more reactive between this two will react with this.	115.36361960171014
If you stop here as a 95 percent level , then you see lot of polymer , large chain polymers and the small amount of monomers and the left over initiators , ok.	379.4924618241729
Now , utilizing this concept you can actually synthesize functionalized polymers , which are also called telechelic polymers , which we discussed in the last class.	260.00035019146014
So , this is the probability and this is the second segment; number wise if second segment can be placed is z p.	112.24436294548217
There is very tricky situation; in many cases people have also reported effectiveness factor exceeding unity; experimental observations.	7227.811452696317
So , this is the dilemma which molecular it should make , it will make high , very high molecular weight; your properties will be higher.	429.84128536836215
Light scattering as we know when electromagnetic radiation interacts with a molecule or a particle , it induces a dipole in the samples and the magnitude of the dipole will depend on how the charge can be separated.	1079.0465881374275
That means either when the substrate concentration is much , much smaller than km or when it is much higher than km.	30.083323304659753
Typically , the activity of the catalyst is measured as a k g; k g of polymer produced per gram of catalyst in an hour or completely or at the end of the or at end of the your or for a complete polymerization.	972.961300832778
And you can have a c o , you can a c o o c , let us put it b make it , and you can have , so three types of carbonate possible , this one , this three , 1, 2, 3, now this peak we can find out from a homo polycarbonate of a , this one from homo polycarbonate b.	639.1721208215469
Once it reaches this value , it will not proceed.	351.40905702815104
It has been noted in most cases that the solvents which are relatively more non - polar are better suited for carrying out enzymatic reaction mainly because of their lack of interaction with the water layer on the enzyme molecule.	141.22659280323367
So , in case of , in case of polar solvent for a given anion , lithium will , lithium cation will have a higher reactivity than sodium and potassium , cesium , and in a non - polar medium it would be , order would be reverse.	396.7391399421176
Therefore the substrate concentration at which the reaction will take place actually in the particle boundaries will be less than that in the bulk or at the surface and therefore the effectiveness factor will be less then or equal to one.	56.535043549560854
So , if you compare , shall i pmma with a bp pc , which have a reflective index 1.594, then obviously the maximum transparence possible , for pmma is higher than a.	901.828854187572
And then extra plot this value to c equals to .	204.52868714570022
But irreversible inhibitors cannot be removed once added to a reaction mixture and their effect is irreversible.	2356.0501563737007
The first thing that we must look at is the pattern of binding of inhibitor to enzyme or enzyme substrate complex.	94.53922168057726
Otherwise there is no practical application of pvc of polyvinyl chloride also , though it has a rigid back bone.	896.7444147583961
These characteristics makes a very unique situation and whenever contents in the reactor are at the same composition as in the product stream it implies that the concentration of the substrates in the reactor is at a level which is present in the outlet stream.	289.52544391665305
This does not take part in the polymerization reaction , where for a small fraction of their lifetime , they are present in this active form.	97.70823226092487
During the reaction if some molecules oligomer are forming , which are say , precipitate out of the solution , if you are doing the reaction in a solution , if the oligomer precipitate out , then the functional groups are not available to reaction.	177.516772890051
So , if you had the ratio from the ratio of the peaks of this corresponds to 3 protons for the monomer and this correspondence , and this corresponds to the 3 protons of the polymer , so from this ratio , you can find out what is the conversion of monomer into polymer.	160.7986442081417
So , the hydrogen bonding in acrylic acid polymer is much lower compared to acrylic acid monomer , which means del h value will be lower for acrylic acid compared to say acrylonitrile.	335.50024659170117
If the partitioning creates unfavorable conditions for the reaction then it will not be more than one.	86.93472662431383
Second is d is large.	346.34853125801226
And if they are free that happens in a polar medium , then as we discussed now , you can consider this carbon the terminal carbon as a planar molecule; it has a planar geometry.	127.48410643628796
In both the cases the equilibrium constant of the reaction is approximately equal to one.	16.29217375553324
What are the functional groups you require for a step polymers or a chain polymers , so on.	58.79211508671825
In this case we just talked about the propagation and initiation , propagation and the termination reactions , now there could be transfer reaction , chain transfer reactions as well.	43.94320687578776
They will not change at all because there is no change in thermal energy in the system delta h m is .	249.95179759999766
So , once the polymer material has taken the shape of the container where we are doing the curing process , what happen is you cannot remelt it because they are cross linked.	249.81560388093027
And if you decrease the molecular weight; obviously , there will loss of , lot properties including mechanical properties , thermal properties and so on.	188.3238098119604
The quaternary structure could be a dimmer , it could be trimer , it could be a tetramer depending on the number of chains present and the organization will really lead to the final conformation.	489.35479148006243
Now , in this reaction , the phenol boiling point is 180 degrees centigrade , bp of phenol is 180 degree centigrade.	361.9921402420553
And you know , less number of monomers can be polymerized cationically , and there are even lesser number polymers , which can be polymerized by both anionic and cationic polymerization.	163.28007444583804
L by basic definitions and therefore f is usually less than .	265.7372312793137
We will be mainly , or exclusively discussing the copolymers , where you start with a mixture of two monomer , and then synthesis the copolymer.	203.15035285433407
For example calcium alginate although insoluble in aqueous medium gets solubilised by certain ions like phosphate ions.	1270.3558146058822
Now a solution in the solvent , chemical potential is lower than in the solvent so the vapor pressure of the solvent in the polymer solution will lower.	70.90617291531754
There is also emphasis of making new polymers of complicated structures which will find applications in newer especially in medicines and also this this is a continued research interest where you take existing polymers and add additive fillers , new additive fillers or different processing step , now improve processing include polymer processing where you you make this different improved application of or newer applications of the existing polymer.	5750.201475979437
Take poly a , which is homopolymer , and mix poly b , which is another homopolymer.	671.3269747544906
Now again this bond this bond they can fully rotate.	866.9290992483767
Instead of looking at the catalytic reaction in a homogenous phase where the catalyst is dissolved in the same medium as the reactant here the catalyst has a different phase - solid phase and the substrate is in the liquid phase.	690.5897161979923
So , second segment can be placed in any of this z cells.	55.0311179673792
So , if i want to define a glass transition temperature , that it is a temperature at which the glassy state is changed into the rubbery state.	142.45157265777777
I am using a general term reaction environment mainly because while most of the reactions are to be carried out in aqueous medium today there are requirements that many of the reactions may be carried out in organic non - polar medium.	218.91764306503532
Now , what are the monomers it is difficult to polymerize , or cannot be polymerized at all.	69.61686458947038
Next set of polymers we go is polysulfones and polyketones the generic structure is this its similar to the bisphenol astructure is polycarbonate x is , but in this case x is allied instead of h and y is either a carbonyl or so 2 group.	1544.3600612613511
So , again just for one more time that the initiation rate constant his much lower compare to a propagation chain propagation which is much faster reaction very termaist much faster even faster reaction.	1519.174350257917
Now , we know to termination to happen termination is a by molecular reaction between say to to propagate radical , we know termination would be by add a coupling or by this propagation reaction.	1398.1034412466713
You can dissolve the monomer in a solvent and do the polymerization then it is named as solution polymerization.	624.2147290886307
And , to prevent that , what are the things we might do or it is typically done.	105.47756039632664
There are several columns by through which they send these gases before they actually can utilize this gases to pure the inert atmosphere in the reaction , in the reaction environment.	826.4696360523642
Now , this will , how do you name again because this just a polymer of the monomer , so poly caprolactam caprolactam.	392.06549015235504
So , for a organic chemist which is doing a stratification reaction for small molecules , a 98 percent conversion may be quite satisfactory which means that at 450 minutes time , he can stop the reaction and take the product which is 98 percent conversion which is quite sufficient and quite satisfactory , but for a polymer chemist , that 90 percent conversion is not sufficient.	665.6251136421293
Now , if we write two pair; two asymmetric pair of carbon atom , now this is the horizontal line.	429.3507946488924
If you make different preparation with different enzyme loadings the reaction rate will be proportional to the enzyme loading.	90.20707678522963
Now , if you plot with time , see this is experimental plot.	90.220283000726
So , they are thermodynamically miscible , immiscible polymers blends were the individual polymers components are phase separated.	1029.48578928198
So , total number of polymer solvent contacts , q would be , n 2 is the number of molecules , polymer molecules x , z minus 2 phi .	64.6895497743337
This , this is the step , which is rate determining step.	58.47665533439578
Next step of additives are basically use to make the polymer surface useful for biological applications , there are lots some applications , where polymers or parts of parts made of polymeric polymeric polymers are used in biological application.	1683.9985170541522
Similarly , if we write the equation for theta equals to 0 line , we get this and if we only dealing with very dilute solution , and if you ignore this higher terms.	222.75259701010182
The molecule becomes so rigid that the structure is very rigid and deactivation is impossible.	1700.246226739204
And look at the value , you will know that this is the more stable radical then this secondary radical then this one then this and in this case because again this is a primary radical.	230.96414329897235
Similarly , you can increase the inter more attraction , you can introduce some specific bonding; like hydrogen bonding , that will increase the enthalpy , the delta h of melting , and by that we can increase the melting point , and obviously better packing is always help in increasing the , you can understand better packing is always improve the t m melting point of the polymer.	302.86104703125966
So , is basically flow state , this example of real polymers , nylon 6 is semi crystalline polymer , is basically drops after t g , it drops very fast and then , after t m this is t m and after t m , it is becomes polymer that , if the elastic modules becomes very low after t m.	504.36157627204886
At low temperature and high strain rate , polymer demonstrates elastic behavior , as we have seen earlier in our strain stress discussion.	260.04462304504233
Only certain molecules which have sufficient energy to undergo reaction will result into the product formation and it will be only a fraction of the total molecules that participate in the collisions process are able to yield the product.	359.664522837325
Now , what are the different stages of polymers and then how the polymers are transformed from one stage to another and ultimately where how the polymer industry works and then we talked about finally about what are the important research areas in currently researcher focusing in polymer chemistry.	495.58204477096075
When you store the glutaraldehyde solution , it is present in two different forms.	294.5893234194812
It may occupy the same binding site.	147.79399781021027
Now , i have cross link here , here and there somewhere , somewhere like this , something like this , what is a molecular weight of this polymer.	151.44074301232135
We discussed the various types of chain transfer reactions possible in radical polymerization , and their effect; effect on molecular weight in principle , that modes are chain , more chain transfer happen , molecular weight actually gets reduced compared to if there was no chain transfer reaction.	297.799927576428
So these are the examples how the structure of monomer will determine , whether it can undergo chain polymerization by anionic species , anionic initiator , or a cationic initiator , or radical initiator , and we have seen the examples of several monomers , and let us see the table and we summarize , whatever we are just learned in first last five ten minutes.	317.4529732862411
Thermoplastics can be amorphous or semi - crystalline.	599.2281837009888
Thirdly we came to inhibition patterns with respect to the single substrate reactions and the effect on the inhibitor concentration on the reaction rate and also the effect of activators on the reaction rate.	94.4875077469591
Now given this two structure , now the fact that , this monomer which is reacting with this reactant species , which means that , whether this is radical or cat ion or anion , will get stabilized , by the substitution y present.	378.8155364220821
Here also you have an interphace which consist of hydrophobic tails.	711.6274653250222
So , they are frozen.	75.44651042018808
From the two forms it gives you two different kinds of cross linked enzyme preparation.	219.0546514018668
This has led to one of the diagnostic method particularly for the patients who are suffering from cardiac problems the lactate dehydrogenase from the heart muscles undergo the quaternary structural change.	1342.4121985828835
So , we can write the next step.	17.86775297795708
For the c - terminal alpha carboxylic group the pka is three and for the aspartic acid beta carboxylic group , the pka is 3..	5787.330924999582
Bulk of the commercial application have been in the area of hydrolytic enzymes with the exception of glucose isomerase which is in the isomerase category.	178.97597499755656
And it seldom practice the in the increase in rate of polymerization can be achieved much easily then by increasing the temperature than increasing the pressure.	339.7935879642049
Now once we had placed all the polymer molecules , now we can place the solvent molecules in the vacant cells.	68.147361402269
For example , if we have gpc with ri plus light scattering detector , the light scattering gives us the limiting excess rayleigh ratio delta r theta is equal to 0 and if you are working a very dilute solution we can consider concentration c is equal to .	303.5997879979401
That means the contents , carbohydrates , lipids and proteins or some other biomolecules which are often attackable by the enzyme molecules.	704.31819018209
Collagen can be taken mixed with the enzyme solution and you make a dispersion of the enzyme with the collagen solution.	264.8428280737201
So , in case of cationic , r 1 is 10.5 and r 2 is 0..	133.95579140177736
You will also appreciate that the use of enzymes particularly for an industrial application are often limited to the sections that are listed here.	344.59295202236393
And if you are doing in a solution , you are doing this poly step polymerization reaction solution , then you can also try and change the solvent.	63.73091989971484
If the binding sites even if they are more than one , if they are not interactive that means they are independent of each other and do not interfere in binding of each other , then michaelis menten kinetics will be valid.	112.64180861504585
Again , this is the summation of the concentration of all the cationic species , propagating species present in the medium.	15.334820049328895
But the glucose concentration results in either production or consumption of oxygen as a result of the enzyme reaction and that is the purpose.	679.8181728332562
So , once a bond occupies a volume in the space , no other bond can occupy the same space basically presence of a polymer chain of or polymer segment is excluding , any other polymer segments to occupy the same volume.	131.30118251105986
The second type is alternate copolymer where you have alternate , exactly alternate arrangement of this two monomer and third is block , block copolymer where you have a significant longer chain of say , m 1and a significantly longer chain of m .	960.1970189169475
This will be higher from any other because he was talking about this is a gas phase reaction.	141.2694420565659
What you are getting is the polymer chains are forming in steps , dimer , trimer and tetramer and because these monomers can react this function group , so they will react immediately.	205.07552074718345
In the zero order regime the space time will be identical in the two cases.	44.43796602928378
The repeat unit we talked about that means if you write a polymer structure and the bracket you have put n that means you have to find the the portion thus unit which is repeating.	486.9652330311882
If we increase the temperature of your reaction then what happens , m e goes up.	53.41691942500242
The glucose can enter into more than one metabolic pathway.	957.4086306410566
Because of , fog formation and customer will not be able to look at the food material , which is inside the wrapper.	591.8022309493281
So the time of contact is very important and it is not used mostly more than five minutes and if you take a dilute solution probably you can go higher , followed by filtering and drying of complex at 45c.	2163.6967668471716
When we look at bisubstrate reactions we notice that this inhibition pattern gives you lot of information about the sequence of binding of the substrate in the case of a bisubstrate reaction.	110.70513658094134
H in the case of catalase , it is 100.4 kilo joules per mole.	435.58769478115903
Similar exercise we do for the second data point we also develop another expression , another straight line and this gives you let us say for s2 v.	944.8718105171865
It is based on the polymerization mechanism and the reaction product.	43.40333418246734
In this case if you poly a , and a block poly b , then you can actually used these copolymer , block copolymer as a comfortabalizer , between poly a and poly b , and by doing this you can actually improve the property of the blend , of poly a and poly b.	99.08540079259699
And typically if you have , this peroxides , or this s s bonds or if you have n o bonds in your molecules; these bonds typically having bond dissociates energy of this range , so they form on hitting , and a normal , the reaction temperature they form radical , each molecule form two radicals.	1797.7676785670812
Foam of polymer polystyrene is found by impregnating and blowing agents , and we have seen yourself many applications of polystyrene founds like disposable drinking cups , the cushions , cushioned packaging and thermal insulator and sometimes , these cushions packaging like your labeled reagent bottles comes with some packing outside or some boxes made up of polyester in foams.	9194.716294588703
Now , in this case the excess rayleigh ratio is angle dependent and it has larger value or the highest value at 0 angle; and as we increase the value of the scattering angle , the value for this excess rayleigh ratio start decreasing.	349.3711815591904
Similarly if it initially binds with ks on to other binding site it can influence the conformational change on the other binding site and it can meet.	190.924668374889
So what are factors that influence the value of melting point or melting temperature.	160.90485540979768
Then you can react with amino group of the enzyme molecule.	7.820211665881719
Now this term is nothing but ln activity of the solvent.	43.27263906723359
The first and probably the most common feature could be the shift in equilibrium.	38.87732521354033
W is the possible distinguish; all the arrangement you are doing by changing the position of the molecules has to be distinguished and they have to be of the same energy because in this case of ideal solution because interaction energies are same between like and unlike molecules so , once if you do interchange between solute and solvent molecules , they will produce degenerate arrangements.	1114.4098251164035
So , we found the quantity of relations between the amount of condensate present at the end of the reaction with the degrees of polymerization in that along with its relational equilibrium constant , and we have seen that unless we have a quite high value of equilibrium constant , we have to go down the residual value of the condensate to a very low level to build a higher molecular weight.	221.06022930817443
The primary factors responsible for the increase in adsorption with temperature are when the protein binds to a surface there is some unfolding of the protein molecules , which is an endothermic process and the increase of temperature resulting in enhanced adsorption supports the hypothesis that the binding or adsorption of a protein molecule or a polymeric material to a surface is an endothermic process coupled with unfolding of the confirmation.	1398.5964100825322
Similarly , in this case , the reactivity of this radical does not depend; we are assuming that it does not depend on the size of the molecules.	37.848717536927275
Fire retardants additives enable plastics to meet various fire safety and performance standards imposed upon them , you know the application of plastics in various common public purpose like say in aeroplane or in building materials.	5866.033342578901
We applied simple model of terminal model , where we basically we are talking about how the composition of copolymer can be predicted from the reaction , reactivity monomer reactivity ratios.	1073.1376143149323
So , you multiplied by 2 to get the number of moles of functional groups reacted , and n 0 was the monomers were present originally.	284.47252768935306
So , the molecular of structure units twice the molecular repeating.	160.1066209193426
Therefore at high salt concentration adsorption is usually poor and minimum salt concentration is required to be kept.	928.8317174042867
So , basically we had to put twice; average multiplied by twice for this.	502.34760073538916
So , you are a value could be lower 0..	413.1173725704221
So , how we will look at , how the weight fraction is distributed.	79.45154531590748
It can also be carried out by colloidal platinum.	91.34834547023071
So , we require n 1 plus n 2 x which is n 0; this is the number of lattice we require where each size of each lattice is either same as the size of solvent molecules or same as the size for a segment of a polymer.	169.22671112970684
High specific activity means the catalytic power of the enzyme is much high.	1291.006333514779
So , they form a lubricating layer on the base polymer surface and improve the wear resistances , these are the examples of few mold release agent.	85.86827082222543
Also important is that , it should not generate toxics smoke; that is also important.	190.53215678331796
That means you can use them continuously over a very long period of time and we must also look at how the reactor type influences the operational stability.	65.14586655276415
So , if the free volume is higher , which means they are the region , the free regions where the gas can diffused through , which means the diffusivity will be higher.	141.8198888661347
But even the residence time distribution can give you reasonably good idea of the non - ideality of the flow based on which one can even monitor the reactor performance and use that information particularly for scaling it up when you want to go on a larger scale reactor.	816.0972853325037
The molecule is very compact.	168.741626672832
With that view i think we would like to look at the other bisubstrate reactions subsequently and we will stop at this point.	84.42321765855542
And , i take out 2 students and add 2, 40 years , say , professors from any college.	1448.207559634274
Initially they will be at a ground state of their electronic , vibrational and rotational ground states but they will posses the translational energy which can make them move and collide.	616.4814146012735
An initiation consist of 2 steps : 1 - initiator molecules produce 2 radical species , which is the initiating radical or is called the primary radical.	897.002071333449
Now , for temperature 298 k or 25 degree centigrade , what is the m e for different monomers.	282.59337287130785
So , weight fraction of x mar is the weight of all molecules of x mar divided by total weight of the mixture , if n x is the number of molecules having x structural units.	70.61466748195535
Then finally , we get a polymer which has in head tail head tail arrangement.	107.30037047552062
So these are the two criteria s must be fulfilled , so to get a crystalline polymers.	247.14161615512924
So , because of scattering and absorption , there will be loss of intensity.	65.445004462302
This is the range.	61.27153720211006
Let us say you have an immobilized enzyme particle which is non - porous in nature.	15.683517480126167
Now just to complete the types of co copolymerization we have discussed in the last lecture.	61.98524010700782
That means , they are side product which are small molecular in nature which affect m m mode than m w , which means the n w by m n goes up.	350.8430185093483
In case of tensile testing , the tensile bar , a dog bone type specimen or a dumbbell type specimen is fixed one side and another side with a pendulum is is hit the hammered from both the side.	3301.4676936771416
In cases where the binding is random , that means the inhibitor and substrate can bind randomly without any sequence , the mechanism of un - competitive inhibition is very rare.	139.44443218607105
Now , the practical part how the monomers are usually polymerized in a in a industry scenario or in the lab.	437.3897571523384
It is because it is linked to another carbonate which is not in the basic chain.	208.44283039577826
Ea will be formed only by two patterns that is k1a , k - 2 and k4 and k1a , k3 and k.	375.4457933618301
So , if i stop , say the reactions somewhere here after 10 percent conversion or 5 percent conversion , what do you see.	429.6666366333927
Obviously , the target application has to be kept in mind , which , for which application we want to use that additive.	242.68564850102675
Now , let us come to a specific example.	11.714832733462446
So if the thiele modulus is high , the reaction rate is faster.	33.94399354633573
Now , we started discussing about the thermodynamic factor.	51.378307639274645
That was the only assumption.	143.65217287266148
That means the product formation will take place from the substrate complex.	30.694004271130428
And next lecture onwards i will start the chain polymers and chain polymerization with starting with radical chain polymerization.	80.67605353728248
So , the reactivity goes up and if we talk about the effect of counter ion , so let us consider first the polar solvent.	68.67062393329194
Glucose isomerase , some of the native enzymes have a ph optimum of about 7.5 - 8, alkaline.	1643.0021763329676
And in most cases vapor pressure of the polymer solutions are invariably much lower than what has been predicted from the raoult s law which is the law describing the ideal solution.	514.3618173829803
Now , each a group will react with one b group.	61.22203658459885
Now , this because both of these are less than 1, so both of these monomers have a tendency to more tendencies to copolymerize compared to homo polymers.	139.47774409947544
So , this is the number of ways you can add the first segment.	13.571841871404803
When the protein molecule gets folded into a secondary structure of alpha helix , the side chains of the amino acids are projected outwards like a rotatory form.	445.0449788624631
So , that is a head and head to head polymers.	6.998893146575676
The carbon atom in both the ch2oh are identical.	223.12826528608753
A solution of this will give you the substrate concentration profile in the pore or inside the particle.	54.657315967430904
Now , for calculating are defining haze , we will only considered forward scattered light flask , which deviates more than 2.5 degree , on average than the incident light beam.	3072.9126498260957
Once the reactants a and b bind to an enzyme molecule at the active site there are only half of the their degree of freedom that means they become one entity and they lose six of their degrees of freedom and thereby there is a loss of rotational and translational entropy and the transition state will have only three degrees of rotational and three degrees of the translational freedom each.	1016.9707469756244
Then in that case , you can live , build that high molecular weight leaving little excess amount of the condensate.	432.2107027700392
After a very brief induction period the concentration of enzyme substrate complex comes to a steady state.	192.01883710111426
When we talk about specific activity higher the specific activity , enzyme is catalytically better.	613.3843966406938
And , these sides serve as chlorine radical source , which basically initiate the degradation.	519.7083762703102
Now , we know different test impact test , tensile test , now we need to find out , what is the relations between the polymer structure and and the properties.	244.03392079578157
The second parameter is that the reaction must be carried out at less then ten degree centigrade.	143.32011356419784
That gives you a very great operational significance and the use of an immobilized enzyme also leads to relatively purer product.	705.7039350546762
Weights are more significant than numbers.	3305.499497760952
So , what is done it is still done.	73.86365651482777
The conformation resulting from the forces of these interactions that take place are usually classified into four categories.	1778.6888611111294
Then with this total segments and the solvent molecules were placed in the 3d lattice like the small molecules.	735.0295810594954
That means the preparation is highly reactive , the rate of reaction can be very high and the rate of diffusion is slow either because of the . . . of the substrate or the chemical nature of the matrix.	35.017859617796816
One example , the common example is bht , butyl hydroxotolovine; structure is shown here; they are used in this type of anti , primary anti oxidants are used very much for styrenics , vinyls , and elastomers.	719.330486036738
In case of radical it has said that at several combination of monomer possible , because we know that most of the monomers we have seen during our discussion , initial discussion in chain polymerization that , most of the vinyl monomers , they do undergo radical polymerization.	159.26425016236527
If you compare all the methods based on the initial quantity of amino acylase used , the activity recovered in the immobilized form and the yield level activity , the method based on immobilization of amino acylase by ionic binding to deae sephadex proved to be the best in terms of its enzyme activity; seven thirteen units per gram or what ever unit they have used and with fifty eight point nine percent yield of the recovery of the activity from the soluble enzyme as compared to various methods where the activity recovery as well as the final activity of immobilized preparation was much lower.	474.16267452765294
Either the product can inhibit competitively or non - competitively.	691.2451443003889
Reverse micelle is just like water in oil emulsion where by you have enzyme entrapped.	2997.021704455902
That means the partitioning effect of the hydrogen ions between the bulk and the carrier particle depends on the nature of charge.	54.33228581673412
Here in this case this also explains how the energy of activation is reduced in terms of its enthalpic contribution.	272.2549013197909
Whereas , k d for b p o at 90 degree centigrade was 1.33 into 10 to the power minus 4 second inverse.	296.4125133781925
Another very common inhibitor which we come across at always is oxygen.	271.7851278307853
So these are some of the illustrated examples not that these are the only processes which are operational; a large number of other processes which are operational commercially all over the world are one is penicillin acylase.	684.1147892956913
So , k s c is .	14.626656160432761
In other words the concept is very simple and a large variety of biological units have been used to prepare biosensors.	183.99363348652793
And this is the active side which is electron deficient than that formed by the chemisorption of the electropositive metal alkyl , which has a small ionic radius on the surface of the co - catalyst.	120.02608976020548
We have already made the polymer.	57.877815025091905
Under each category also there are number of methods and we need to choose a suitable method for a particular purpose.	387.3959471173601
That means its volume is very much conserved.	441.9410111959158
So , now , write the kinetic expressions , now we are found that , this is the this is the expressions gives the average degrees of polymerization without any transfer reaction , where only the termination is due to either coupling or this propagation.	361.47840826719107
Otherwise it cannot be used as a drug.	40.35063278182678
So , that is , it gives us very important parameter which will be using several times in determining the molecular weight , so intrinsic viscosity relates to the intrinsic ability of a polymer , to increase the viscosity of a particular solvent at a given temperature.	109.85507547427179
Typically , all time in normal reaction , we write a single arrow which means any reversible reaction.	651.5388085084023
Pbm is malic polybutadiene and pu is polyurethane and these are the precursors of certain photocrosslinkable polymers.	4317.677453148975
For example , if you want to use some medical devices you know you in medical devices , like cringes and some other medical component like you most cases before use they are sterilized by applying some spirit rectified spirit , which contains alcohol.	1922.6196757654764
Look at the transmittance t m , or transmission electron micrographs , these black portions are the siloxane domains , and the background is the bpa pc.	4022.223445089609
But we will consider only those patterns which will consist of n - 1 steps.	14.321770292803384
Now in this case , you can argue that , this drop in t m could be , because of the increasing flexibility of the back bone , but you write it can cause some decrease in the t m , because of increase flexibility , but the amount of drop shown here , that can be only explain by the decrease in the inter molecular attraction , because of the fraction of the c u n h group , is less in this polymer chain , compare to the one shown here.	244.6329655255595
And at some temperature , this deformation happens , and that particular temperature is known as heat deflection temperature.	241.29069652256948
At the end , if there are excess m 2, you get free monomers.	113.52984033008399
It could be linear , if the stress strain behavior is linear , it goes from here and come back in the same path.	201.49024521819703
We will have to understand its morphology , its physiology so as to be able to design an appropriate enzyme production system.	514.0854046134001
There are main , too main reasons why they are not so utilized commercially.	690.9624811292921
If e 1 minus e 2 goes up then it will be in an extreme because e 1 and e 2 will get a r 1, r 2 close to 1 which will give ideal copolymerization as we expect.	944.1242645848831
It s not a pathway in the sense of metabolic pathway.	89.26924895702278
But to understand the stereochemical specificity that how enzyme is able to identify the two different stereoisomers , the minimum requirements on the function of an active sites was proposed by oxten as early as 194.	2504.2928337580906
That means most of the substrates which is being fed gets converted into product.	143.18790644491241
Polymers are large molecules , which is made from repetition of structural units.	112.16857418275632
What did the commercial way of synthesis or the most practiced the synthetic process of making polyester or poly ethylene terephthalicin.	3903.2763017882426
Now , let us talk about the first case , where we talked about ideal co polymerization.	38.16290542560313
You will need lot of data available to you before you can apply them but once the data are available one can easily compute and predict many of the behavior which otherwise would have taken a very long time.	2251.34419976808
On the other hand although the operational stability is not very high but the advantage is that the carrier can be regenerated and reused.	36.76975682743118
And we also see whether the molecular rate of the material has changed , by the applying the coming in contact with chemical agent , which can be done by the measuring the viscosity of material.	344.6273834250878
Then the fourth property which is a very important basis for choosing the immobilization method is carrier cost and regenerability because each method has a limitation of the choice of carrier.	223.7998036003024
So , that is the reason , that the transfer coefficient or or the transfer constant is very high for the reaction that is the tendency of oxygen molecule to undergo this reaction is very extremely high.	232.60795676839942
So , this is the number of molecules present which have x mar in x number of x mar , which means number of molecules or changes present at any time having x number of structural units.	127.09706710959543
In aqueous form titanium has five water molecules and one chloride.	3805.6011097153278
Again the number of ways you can arrange different solvent molecules is one.	57.39081291376018
The reaction must be non - spontaneous , should not take place as per the normal thermodynamic concepts.	447.05345470769464
The other analytical application sector was as a therapeutic agent and with development in the availability of different enzymes and particularly the understanding of molecular basis of deceases the use of enzymes as therapeutic agents is by and large increasing.	1696.6226407003207
You don t really get a good solution.	309.5280919224691
So , similarly , like in case of chain polymerization we can write this expression.	12.111055704216602
This is a stable molecule which has much higher free energy change than the reactants and will break down to give the corresponding acid and the alcohol.	387.6875789489471
For toluene , it has a very high rayleigh ratio and we need to purify.	649.8607903707199
So , in that case what is done the polymers as comes out from plant is taken to a step , taken through a step , a polymer processing step which are commonly called compound where the polymer either in a melt form or in powder form is mixed with the required additives or property enhanced enhancing fillers or sometimes with other polymers as well to make polymer blends and you get a intermediate product , is like pellets.	1461.7756890048624
So , if we consider say n butyl lithium as a initiator and toluene as your medium , nonpolar medium and set minus 78 degree temperature.	903.0284689189524
Further increase is not as much as in case of thermal polymerization and because the activation energy for the molecular build up is about 0, which means , there is no effect of the temperature on the molecular weight of redox polymerization , that is why , the redox polymerization are done at room temperature or even sub - roomed temperature because temperature increase would not affect , have no effect on the radical polymerization.	255.41876566225332
The polymers which are made from carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and hydrogen and as inorganic polymers , where beside this elements , carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , you have silicon , phosphorus , boron , sulphur , such elements in the polymer molecules for example siloxanes , silanes , silicon , phosphazenes.	1829.0305695833852
That means if you make a plot between ln v = 1 / 2ln es you will get a linear fit and that can be checked experimentally by making preparations of different enzyme loadings and merge in them enzyme reaction . . ..	686.6547976742472
Let us say this is k1s , k - .	65.09620042710601
So , if you decrease temperature , rate of reaction goes down.	33.21614708176637
If the size goes up , the entropy of mixing comes down.	21.3147225078608
That means we define a term degree of inhibition called i which is nothing but v0 - vi / v.	340.4099366468179
So , in this case , molecular of structure unit is twice the molecular of repeat unit; this is the repeat unit , and this is the structure unit.	82.15266106769384
That is why this copolymers are not usually synthesized by doing ionic copolymerization from a mixture of two or more monomers.	378.1347556471196
Similarly in the case of gelatin , one can mix the gelatin solution with the enzyme solution and pull it.	235.05490019133816
For a perfect total recycled reactor to be considered as a batch reactor operation the requirement should be that the total recycled time must be very small or negligible compared to the total batch cycle; that is the recycling has to be very fast.	309.18514938350944
Now that was the understanding and they also very clearly understood at that time that both substrate as well as the active site on the enzyme molecule have rigid structures.	501.68902238107904
So , limiting oxygen index is basically , the volume of oxygen required , by the total volume into hundred that gives a percentage of material.	636.7089386509093
I will try to explain what it means in a minute.	59.080531152607
Move to the next one which is cross link polyester in this case one example can be taken is a maleic anhydride reaction with ethylene glycol; and once it forms the polymerization is complete at the end you have a double bond in the polyester back bone.	620.2106290548767
The increase in t g , which increase in size of the side groups is mainly because of the restriction of the rotation.	203.67034678105068
They , they preferred , they are , they prefer to be in surface.	152.23604964401028
But that vm value is at a particular enzyme concentration.	97.45458576149188
Now let us look at some data.	28.381482778488145
Because in the handling of colloidal substrates , you often find difficulty with the flux flow reactors.	1434.3083415061558
It is a theoretical value.	120.9208772737718
It has very good resistance to aqueous basis and acids , but there is some problem , disadvantage in polystyrene structure too because it is an aromatic structure.	1744.562064231438
Now , let us see how do you analyze how do you analyze these polymers.	218.80849218776805
So , that is the time when the quick decision is reached.	130.29971155317463
The particular amino acids to give the l - amino acid; it gets deacylated and you get l - amino acid and d form remains untouched.	1184.2036187536794
The product of these two probability is x minus .	121.2616808661833
If you look at immobilized enzyme reactor performance with external film diffusion that means the substrate may be very thick.	36.904810312135425
This is from a practical point of view; this is the temperature where its starts softening , the polymer actually starts softening under some load.	847.533831298137
It is a comparatively simplistic situation.	193.3907547024832
You can add basically the same way; it is basically the same way you have added the second one , you have to add third , fourth , fifth , sixth , etc , the same way you have to arrange.	837.8671564145717
So , handling will be difficult.	89.6009359524201
Whether it is a catalytic function , whether it is a purification of enzyme protein the ionic behavior plays a very key role.	222.00822427376303
Most of statistical copolymers are random copolymers , but not always.	45.594756365592275
It is a simple arithmetic mean so m n would be total mass or weight by total number of moles.	244.8987955977112
T m is from 105 to 110 degree centigrade and density as a set , it is in low density one more time.	2432.329478012954
That is f ( t ) = c / c0 = ( 1 - f1 ) + exp ( - f1qt / f2v ) if you plot this profile.	344.43248307968247
In my first presentation i mentioned about the specificity.	543.5980456600715
Because recovering the enzyme from reaction mixture will be as difficult or as tedious if not more as production of the original enzyme itself and in most cases enzyme being produced by living systems are usually expensive commodities and therefore their deactivation at the end of one batch operation is not a desirable feature and that has been a major limitation.	1488.243064257852
Today we will move to a different topic , which is structural analysis of polymers by spectroscopic method.	234.81974841056638
When we have to use them in water soluble form it only means that the process has to be in the batch mode.	197.42062375228502
In this case we cannot simply do the polymerization reaction with diamine and diacids you require much reactive component functional group.	462.05667582715785
If you start a point somewhere above this point , then less fraction of m 1 would get into the chain.	267.8334760686827
Yes . you are right that this free carboxylic group will be available for adsorbing some proteins which are negatively charged and that s why we try to remove this charge group so that it doesn t interfere during the reaction.	610.2370393905907
Now , block copolymers also could be different types , like linear , the type we just showed.	401.7065371831204
So , if this is the data to convince you , that if you increase the polarity , which is given by dielectric constant , the rate constant or the rate of the polymerization reaction increases.	55.9729491226479
In general , if we talk about different polymers , if you want to compare the mechanical properties of different polymer in general what happen.	115.58294209160998
It becomes k2 [ a ] [ b ] ( 5 ) or in other words the second order rate constant will be nothing else but k2 = rt / nh k * ( 6 ) again you notice a significant fact here that the rate constant is directly linked.	231.87539786810677
Here and if i write this , so in this case , the m 1 now at this point , the copolymers and the feed compositions are same.	132.91991705905127
Then another application in food sector has been on lactose free milk.	1407.3570591937655
If there is a mixture it is always a isotactic polymerization.	48.000050493522814
Now , what happened in that chain , so if there are more than one chains , there are more than one chain in real environment what will happen , now obviously , if you if you consider that this is a , this is unperturbed dimension , and because of excluded volume this is expanding to avoid all the intersections , self intersection it is expanding.	280.9302742444671
This is the practical reactor which we are talking like we talked many of the configurations like which were a combination of cstr and ultra filtration reactor or a hollow fiber module.	442.59814291529756
Then the brewing industry uses for chill proofing of beer.	2424.4113072164564
Once the polymer characterize is over , we go to the processing step and finally , make the product , for the processing step we need to know few information about the polymers.	245.77509744307713
Obviously this alpha methyl styrene have a much lower del h value.	55.062417088927205
The carrier loading capacity also depends on the bulk density of the immobilized enzyme preparation and things like that.	33.7894431189302
Both the binding sites can dissociate independently and lead to formation of a single enzyme substrate complex plus product.	161.3512587618973
Now , i will come to the most important classification of polymers.	31.19200289120436
Substituting the various parameters you get vo = k2 [ e - s ] = k2 [ e ] 0 [ s ] 0 / k - 1 / k1 + s so you get initial rate expression where the initial reaction rate in terms of initial enzyme concentration and substrate concentration are given.	284.8014088275589
So , theoretically , we have seen that it can never be 2 or more than 2, but in practice , we find that after end of the polymerization reaction , if you do explanatory finally what is polymerization distribution , you find that it is slightly over .	217.95914704702685
So , m m n number of average molecular rate is nothing but the simple arithmetic , it is the simple arithmetic mean , average of your sample.	223.2075518470561
For e you can write the pattern as k - 1, k3b and k.	896.2997430952338
Turn over number may work out to be a lump parameter consisting of more than one rate constant.	378.93499158525987
Similarly it should not react with the chemical you are bringing in contact with.	276.1855308332533
So , whatever at the end of your processing steps , you will get the same polymer in the property which was related to the molecular weight , of your target molecular weight.	123.95376299207689
This halogens form hydrochloride or hydrobromic acids , that reacts with the antimony oxides to form antimony halides or antimony oxyhalides , which basically traps those free radicals.	8936.237602678852
Now when r 1 and r 2 is r 1 is r 2 is .	35.33500383474045
You can have stereoisomers or which you call in polymer term , different tacticity.	1612.8910036558348
It is alkylate; first it is alkylate , the metal and then abstract one halogen and form metal ion and which generates one vacant or vital.	6592.904201376458
So , in that case or if you have a cyclic polymer where there is no ends , then end to end distance is also not possible.	109.43833300174705
Hdt is typically as general rule of terms about tg minus 20 degree centigrade.	1851.497816653035
So , this case , this is a protogen , which is basically proton donor protogen and this is cationogen , which is a cationic species donor or carbocationic , carbocation donor.	642.3691252371744
Now , once you isolate the pure monomer first block , and then add to the , and then reacted with the styrene molecule we get this block copolymer; obviously , from the ratio.	369.73296408351393
Porosity is the basis for classification of carriers.	2133.0125250612755
The magnitude of del h comes down.	8.656499449392552
When it forms two radicals , this radical commonly known as tempo.	697.0777401574484
If we put a factor to equate them , now this has to be more than 1, and this is called expansion factor , so if this is 1, then these are equal if there are more expansion , then this will be higher than .	223.43277448045689
So , we will deal , we will discuss only about random coil , not about the other two confirmations of polymer molecules.	272.42780444304833
This is a , let us consider a simple polyethylene molecule.	34.69745738951022
So , we can write this as c by m n a v h.	33.37134899440994
Now we also have seen during our discussion of chain polymerization synthesis that always it is the head - tail arrangement when polymer chain propagates.	424.1154159765178
You can get same number , if i consider how many number of , we have in the mixture.	40.88615022939142
H - t.	12.545440345006273
So now , we completed our discussion on the polymers solutions and in phase separation.	292.01989667336727
These expressions have been obtained analytically in the case of different particle size like in the case of thin films and for spheres.	872.9075232301105
This can react with this self form non radical specious and this can form with other m n dot and can form a non radical specious.	324.85560581629795
I am just describing the right hand side one.	169.70577355669224
This also has the advantage of almost well scattered or data points that can be easily used.	583.7862394634792
So , which means , if the kinetic chain length; there are kinetic chain length which basically , a number of radicals , number of monomers which consumed per radicals.	194.51584493368395
The specificity also is the result of the conformation of active site.	56.94153971236109
That is the reaction rate.	6.805801682693025
Examples , where x a is solvent , if i take carbon tetrachloride , then it can take up chloride and form ccl 3 dot.	451.79457090582196
The temperature where your kd is lies between these; that is the temperature , where the reaction is typically done.	175.2245798169566
So , depending upon the value of this del s and , del h and del s , the del g value will depend.	73.08219375363446
You take this polycarbonate as synthesized in a plant or in lab , add these additives , pigments etcetera and we are compounding strips and you get pc pellets.	1371.4603456780292
Therefore the enzymes play a very central role in the function of living cells or in other words you can say that they are one of the most important executives in a living cell.	115.12465480438026
For example , like you have alpha methane styrene in case of , say , example , the monomers like styrene , where you always get only one possible double bond because there is only one possible beta hydrogen to be eliminated.	263.0571993635434
The batch reactor can be used both for soluble enzyme as well as for immobilized enzyme . you can carry out a batch reactor in a stirred mode or in a packed bed mode with using total recycle and on the right hand side is the characteristic profile of the reaction species that is the substrate and product with reference to time.	155.52075721800563
If we compare between m a and m m a they are very close.	148.10212941836346
So , now we , this reaction step , reaction can process , you know , undergo in thermodynamic control way or a kinetic control way.	257.8788913499532
If you are by any means if you can reduce this m dot , then rt comes down.	37.069891731694554
Now co polymers , you can have random co polymers.	123.78820999959987
And , a summation of all the other terms , m 1 dot , m 2 dot , m 3 dot , m n dot.	321.77843557207893
Otherwise the reactor performance in the zero order regime is identical.	31.61253182274747
The other examples or other types , where you can utilize is , a photo chemical initiator , photo chemical initiator or photo initiator , in short.	731.9687372182316
So , it is a combination of amorphous and crystalline region.	25.3063122423653
In the case of unimolecular reactions this entropic contribution will not be very significant.	111.82844984107092
Therefore one is by binding process the enzyme processes started at much high energy level then the ground state as applicable in the case of uncatalyzed reaction and the other is the complementarity of the enzyme conformation to that of the transition state complex.	421.16987968487206
Now just recap , we had whatever discussion we had in last lecture , about the chain dimension , polymer chain dimension for a linear polymer chain we discussed that most of the polymer chains are flexible in nature; and they form random coil structure , either in solution or in merit.	327.34214071047273
Now , how do we get this , to get this we found the average life time we defined average life time of a radical at steady state at steady state tau s is the concentration of total radical species as steady state by the rate of termination square or 1 by 2 k t.	447.82572923809187
That means there are no actual dispersions and so the velocity profile of the feed stream throughout the length of the reactor is flat or in other words the feed inlet , the feed stream moves almost like a plug and therefore the name what we talk about as a plug flow reactor.	251.87752270286623
Now what is the source for initiator , we require a radical species to initiate the polymer chain , and we now we will look at what are the molecules which , or what are the possible ways we can generate radical , in the reaction medium.	73.25226120951717
And as we have seen , that to reduce the cyclic formation , cyclic molecules formation , it is preferred , that we do the reaction in high concentration of monomer.	30.41375562866429
In the case of immobilized cells initial autolysis of the cell releases some enzyme and then the enzyme remains entrapped and shows normal first order decay.	434.5538711512377
R square to the power half.	73.43366049999038
If you want to have applications where you need where you need a transparent polymeric material , then it is very difficult to do with a crystalline polymers.	115.27792044886941
So , i quickly integrate this expression , d cooh by d t is k m cube; minus , this we can put m; minus m by m cube is k d t.	813.1596971772636
Now , how does it propagate , this can react with either of these two carbon , in terms of possibilities , so if its react with this , then it forms.	138.91382593131794
We had as we mentioned earlier the rate of the reaction r r =.	251.48432650613626
So , eta s p i is the intrinsic viscosity of n i moles of molecules having molecular weight m i present at a concentration of c i per unit volume.	88.76237364736174
These are the intra molecular reactions in the monomers of ab type.	223.87578751856228
Now , remember the discussion we had for radical , this polymerization , radical chain polymerization , where the initiation steps is much slower compared to propagation step , but in this case , this anionic polymerization , the initiation steps are much much faster compared to propagation steps.	64.58075399812328
They are always present in the cyclic formation.	18.86569936932419
One is that the patient after sometime fails to respond to dialysis , if the concentration goes very high the volume of the dialysate required is very large.	491.68970577886654
So , what is the experiment is done , oxygen and nitrogen are mixed , and basically starts with pure nitrogen , and oxygen is increased slowly , to find out that the minimum oxygen required in terms of volume percentage in this mixture , to sustain this flame for a specified time said for three minutes.	1687.8235567035772
So , that it will get clear little bit more , if it is not clear already.	733.482207754473
We all know what is a crystal.	253.57076603868572
So , the termination reaction his low now once the termination reaction his low steady state is lost.	245.28501713311954
How does it look.	9.920786023722302
This had the characteristic feature in the sense that if you write the michaelis menten equation assuming the substrate concentration and the initial reaction velocity as constants and km and vm as variables although it is little unusual and unrealistic but just for the sake of a mathematical analysis if we write that , we can write for example 1 / v0 = km + s / vm . s if you just take a reciprocal vm / v0 = km + s / s vm = v0 ( 1 + km / s ) we have just written the equation in the form of vm and km as variables.	441.83230179544665
In uk ,.	607.1296164207724
Another source of non - ideality could be that the reactor may have some kind of dead zone because of the improper mixing and this dead zone is v . f.	1686.0877364691785
So , rayleigh ratio is basically this expression and delta r theta is nothing but rayleigh ratio for the particular theta for the solution minus rayleigh ratio for the solvent.	444.93695266172995
So , the molecular weight of ring opening polymerization is dependent on the conversion.	28.755611604667507
If you look at the energy content of the molecules it will show you a gaussian distribution.	102.9937376731469
But the enzyme acts on glycerol molecule and produces l - glycerol - 3 - phosphate.	537.9596384177786
So if you increase further , your t m further goes down.	93.69813864463993
The arrangement or the organization of the multiple chains could be two chains; there could be three chains or four chains.	1013.5055938136535
So , in this case , because the reactivity of monomer m is lower , they get incorporated much lower rate , than monomer m 2, where if the higher rate , reaction reactivity of m 1 is higher compare to reactivity of m 2, that m 1 and incorporated in much faster rate compared to in m .	548.9103154353015
The major advantage of this method is that it does not require any modification or involvements of the amino acids residues of the enzyme which results in the high yield and stability because there is no modification of the enzyme structure involved in the entrapment methods.	216.3314454238498
Now , by this , you may not have to remember all this approach , unless you are extremely interested to know the logic behind to get the final expression.	242.40511089372563
Now in the case of enzymatic catalysis we must bear clearly in our mind that one of the characteristic features is that enzymes has a certain ligand binding sites and more specifically substrate binding sites.	262.34574095407044
So , as i said that mark - houwink equation derived before flory - fox equation as a empirical equation.	343.96132895031866
In this case that will in suit that the polymers which are forming , they are not killed or the chains which has getting initiated , they are not killed.	434.7723572609274
In a simplistic mechanism we notice that we have a dissociation constant km for the enzyme substrate binding and dissociation constant ki for the inhibitor binding.	423.12686952855137
First thing comes into mind is a polymer and more often not a polymer becomes very often the material of choice for new applications.	1052.0373456966809
Applications are in the most of this has very good strength , flexibility in packed resistance and these are good melt flow behavior.	492.56607920442
Then in such case we would like very high fractional conversion.	111.9409647518793
So , it will look something like this , where this is the direction of pp is 1 in this case , and the other curves are for lower p which means for a given r , you take any of the r here.	260.27910520174896
Now , each of these are the number of functional groups unreacted.	22.750914261933403
In most cases they are specific interaction between polymer and solvent molecule is different than the interaction between a solvent - solvent molecule or a polymer - polymer molecules.	113.49033373182293
So , we can easily remove the monomer molecules , which we can discuss the monomer molecules and we can only count the polymer chains.	111.60802398073162
Then , it was dramatically the polymerization nature was dramatically changed.	500.7125622583826
Experimentally you cannot determine the vm value because it is a saturation rate asymptotic to the axis and therefore you can never reach that value experimentally.	1114.8646080084839
Now when this monomers undergo anionic polymerization , it will form a species like this.	43.71481532914917
Fourth is we must do is accurately epr solution.	1070.428647093671
By taking a buffered reaction mixture at a higher ph the concentration of hydrogen ions in the reaction mixture can be maintained at a very low level and the reaction can be driven in the forward direction.	200.13399829673463
So , to avoid confusion sometimes it is written at small r lower case r and sometimes this is written as s.	362.10780203486496
So , if i consider one example.	26.010437789331892
So that gives you a neat analytical procedure to define your kinetic behavior of the allosteric enzymes that are available in the living systems mostly for regulatory purposes.	371.98382721311094
Now , as long , as long as m is less than 1, molar cyclization will be preferred.	98.7594089506268
We talked about the backbone of these polymers.	52.93590157679851
And in other case normal linear poly condensation case you have dimmer , trimer , tetramer and it go slowly one after one , but in this case the monomers comes by diffusion to the interface reacts with the chain end.	329.84084255723906
When we say enzyme substrate complex is formed we are talking of only one enzyme substrate complex that is formed.	121.06401451973531
To have a high molecular weight polymer you need to have high value of x n , is the number one monomer unit or structure unit present in the system.	96.80620760858557
So , they cannot be molten , you know melted by heating.	167.66540504944993
This is the inflection point this is the inflection point.	95.41950599208499
So , that they remain in the as a dispersion form because you have this soluble water soluble polymers or the ionic particles which actually act as a stabilizer for this droplets.	596.5683668906515
But if effectiveness is the same the cost is the principle determining factor.	345.58088460723445
So , they are used in optical fibres for light transmission , eye goggles and cd.	1382.242590829725
Some uses this inflection point , the inflection point as t g.	748.347424956056
For each binding of the substrate to a binding site the affinity reduces by a factor let us say a , as interaction factor.	645.5649856072807
But if we use alkyl aluminum , then what happened.	39.695124653234
They make this process definitely , they make or they synthesize the polymer in the , polycarbonate in the plant them self.	1018.0103662457643
Ss ] 1 / 2 that means the thiele modulus is inversely proportional to the substrate concentration at the surface.	67.35971736987119
And , that is done by adding secondary anti oxidant.	73.73062358544932
So , we can remember what the purpose we were trying to convert this raw data to distribution plotting weight fraction versus molecular weight.	173.56621287896252
N 0 was number of molecules in the beginning and n is the number of molecules now.	64.75389728144461
So , theta is t by psi.	220.30318334855966
So , you test the mechanical properties , the different types of test can be conducted , static states test like a tensile compressive shear properties , which gives stress and curves , stiffness and strength and toughness of polymeric material.	1005.8174271314573
And what you have to do to tackle this you will understand what is going on and understand the chemistry behind this side reaction and then do whatever now your best way to minimize this side reaction unwanted reactions.	410.55185262960407
So , basically below this temperature everything is soluble , in a polymer soluble at every composition so if i take that flory - huggins expression this one and flory - huggins expression this one and write the conditions from for spinodal id equal to 0, you get the spinodal points like 1 1 minus pie 2 plus.	816.0212308829907
The last effect is due to ionization of substrate.	202.67883341016054
Then penicillin measurement using an enzyme penicillinase which hydrolyzes penicillin using a glass electrode , this can also be measured.	2064.0991456920983
So , the real chain , real end - to - end distance would be proportional to approximately proportional to this multiplied by this , which gives you 10 to the power 3 by 5, this is approximately proportional to n to the power 315; the rms end - to - end distance for a real chain.	70.05508150671106
X a being polymer , consider poly ethylene , you have another chain , it could be dead chain dead polymer.	684.3641739410625
Besides the inhibition pattern the next step if you recall is the relative concentration of feed substrate and the magnitude of s0 / km and the kinetic regime of the reaction.	176.3133511564803
Any catalyst or any chemical reaction if you look at the reaction profile it can be indicated as between time and product formed and ultimately the rate of the reaction at duration dp / dt at the zero time will give you the initial reaction rate.	323.03683441687417
As i mentioned some time earlier also that the adsorption process undergoes slight unfolding of the enzyme protein and unfolding of the enzyme protein is an endothermic process which results in reduction in the optimum temperature; alkylation by covalent binding is 45c , entrapment is 50c.	750.0005729061692
Because use of packed bed reactors with an almost 40 % total solids syrup is highly energy intensive and is usually avoided.	4445.766751623397
If you consider the same class of hexokinase a very closely related enzyme is what we call as gluco - kinase.	305.9063547476901
So , there is no question of local heat formation , local spot formation , hot spot formation and degradation of molecules and thermal control becomes easier.	604.8956631340501
From transition state some bonds have to break some has to form.	4931.272504213904
But when we talk of allosteric enzyme we are talking of a favorable interaction.	120.68725346433939
So , in this case the enthalpy of crystallization is not taken in to account.	255.22821243074597
And , there is a partial ionization of these alkyl bridge and also polarization of this monomers , which produce this intermediate , which then form a six membered ring transition state; which basically form a six membered ring transition state.	724.3002587341997
So , in general , if you want to summarize , flexible back bone , lower modulus and strength , chain stiffness would have back bone or bulky side group increases the modulus and strength , and chain stiffness lower the impact strength and elongation would break.	387.3015065400089
So , it has a positive value compared to m m a.	37.67006104410051
For example , if we have a diol , or a di acid , or a hydro oxide acid , in case of the polyester is , reaction is just talking about; re - activities of both the functional group 1n the bi functional monomers are same.	174.48577652233794
Whereas in the case of thorell and chance mechanism this will be a binary complex , this will not be a modified enzyme.	27.963177706621888
If you have a , if you want to do electro chemical polymerization or electro chemical radical polymerization , you can , you use this technique to start the polymerization.	106.21905142780335
So , total probability of finding the chain , other chain end at a distance r would be the probability distribution function multiplied by the volume element.	183.14584271957813
The method is very simple and involves two steps , activation of the matrix by steeping it in a transition metal salt solution whereby the transition metal salts form an octahedral complex.	315.5380948097531
The one which is larger has to be used.	36.35851387905897
In most cases , it will be alternating , but there will be some cases , there will be two m 1 and three m 1 sitting next to next each other.	122.15907705389698
The covalent linkage is accomplished through functional groups that are not involved in the catalytic functions , a very standard prerequisite for any immobilization method.	1224.1162632070334
There are many preparations like for example preparation of fumaric acid from aspartic acid where the enzymes are too specific and usually there are no other enzymes present in the cell which will be able to utilize those substrate.	994.8346115002234
There is no binding of the inhibitor molecule with the enzyme substrate molecule once the substrate molecule has bound to the enzyme , the inhibitor is ineffective.	251.13876258290574
So , that is the , i guess the interaction energy between a polymer and a solvent and we named as a flory - huggins polymer solvent interaction parameter.	134.017740134967
It has a very peculiar property which is really carried forward in the function and structure of the enzyme molecules.	751.303024578417
Now , we will move to the step growth polymerization and its kinetics and mechanism.	42.2058727659722
So the only difference lies in the case of reactor performance of plug flow reactor.	27.724354664409624
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.3446805143128864
Look at some of the phrases which i mentioned; cross linked water insoluble polymeric gels.	409.2888914598014
So , orientation increases modulus and for a semi crystalline polymer , if we increase a some glassy additives like glass fibers in the amorphous region then , basically the elastic modulus goes up.	300.21120268534753
They are very selective; for example if i take a specific example of styrene and acrylonitride.	160.47582454875362
If suppose the entire enzyme ses is in this form , both these sites are totally saturated because es and se also will lead to the product formation.	318.0788844598736
So , just to clarify one more time , in case of styrene we have the styrene unit as as a repeat unit and in case of pet you have this unit away with a repeating unit.	373.71587083293275
Temperature dependent on terms of the rate constant k p , k d and k t and same , as you can do this and do the same exercise what we did for the thermal initiation and see what is the value of e r in this case.	84.59076716169876
So , if we write m; m is the fraction of pair adjacent repeat units that are present in a isotactic geometry.	131.85054009501124
And happens that happens for large flexible polymer chains long chains and this this polymer molecule can be precipitated by one equivalent , this is equivalent hydrodynamic particle , and one has the same friction coefficient as the polymer molecule.	932.4522681031492
For retention of the coenzyme we use instead of a small molecular weight coenzyme , a water soluble polymer bound coenzyme.	252.58645494949258
Now again this will be just briefed , we will have a brief discussion on this properties , and subsequent properties.	544.9698672931023
If you extrapolate these two lines , at the point where ph and pk are identical you will get a point of intersection at which the two lines will merge.	1207.9081319326986
Then in that case radioactive material could be also used as tracers so that they can be monitored at the exit stream by measurement of simple radioactivity by the counters.	1264.4403475638421
We will discuss these two in a minute.	43.43762684583335
Now , these are the some of the numbers of different r 1, r 2, r and their product as well.	140.1525733445991
So , it has to be z minus .	13.888054137793558
And of course , the similar type of advantages are there as in the case of suspension polymers , the heat removal is not a problem , viscosity build up is also not a problem in this case.	219.59508371695406
If they can make biodegradable that is , fine.	218.4554048117653
You put it on a magnetic stirrer or you can also insert a mechanical stirrer if you want and then you can add the enzyme particles into it and the substrate can be fed to it.	512.5693225128084
So , w which is the total number of ways the entire 3d lattice containing n 1 solvent molecules and n 2 polymer molecules can be filled by this way.	79.37974330126453
A whole lot of chemical reactions do take place in a living cell.	22.10675956272528
Then , we talked about importance of copolymerization in last lecture , how we can improve the property of an existing homo polymer by introducing another co - monomer in the polymer.	394.0163077074874
It mean that the first order transitions which , in case of first order transitions like melting where g is a linear function of basically it varies with temperature , pressure and volume continuously.	634.1816986239768
But in case there is deviation one will find quite different values and the actual reactor performance will be judged by the reactor performance based on the distribution and kinetics.	375.9697518436469
The substrate might reach at the centre of the particle and all the particle is interacting with the substrate.	83.97067177577222
And this is phosgene bisphenola is taken in the aqua sodium hydroxide solution and phosgene is passed through a organic solvent , in this case say methylene chlorideforming bpa pc or bisphenola poly carbonate.	634.2311195886635
Experimentally the magnitude of ka , kb , k a and vm can be determined by double reciprocal plot analysis.	309.0341755727285
It has been felt that for many applications their isolation and purification is not required.	1170.8374418285914
Typically , organic you cannot use organic material for char form , for making a cement char because organic material themselves burn off.	3972.2955366997808
In the last lecture we have started our discussion on polymer molecular determination , and we actually discussed how to get the viscosity average molecular weight.	47.68843253459136
So , what is done industrially , you make a rubbery , rubberic code , so you make a rubberic code of poly butadiene.	340.2699012823181
That means that the dissociation of that , that is the break down of the ea complex is very , very slow.	49.83174944045399
If you talk about say eye drop you have polymer in aqueous solutions with salt and other ingredients.	419.2604817167557
Es binds to the inhibitor with inhibition constant of a ki to form esi and substrate binds to ei.	560.570011036891
This dpi is blue and this is colourless.	784.050302894549
The principle interactions that are present in the case of any given protein or that applies to an enzyme are peptide bonds.	327.5177617243294
So , critical composition at which the polymer started , starts a separating out from solution is given by 1 by 1 plus x , x is the number of segments , chain segments which is always very high , x is always much , much greater than .	293.52652853905454
Nanowires or nanofibers , where it is basically whiskers or filaments with diameters in the range of 100 to 10 to 100 nanometer , having high aspect ratio.	2253.2275833985286
They only lead to formation of the two products in a sequential manner.	347.1126564729927
How many.	13.40977711413269
Now , what are the assumption if did use this expression r p his k p a m , what are the assumption we made one was that initiation was slow , propagation his fast and termination was even faster.	1128.0004066244253
So , basically , what am what we need to know that because of , the high molecular weight of the polymers , the entropy of mixing is not contributing significantly to the energy of mixing.	34.85056734742716
Another criterion which plays a very key role into the carrier matrix.	184.36553050358535
That means kappa value for e to es will be k1.s and this will be k - 1and you will notice that wherever a substrate or product species is involved you will multiply the rate constant with that.	930.0550606765859
So , that is your molecular weight distribution.	12.094549629922206
But in case of synthetic polymers , now these conformations , there are many conformations polymer conformations possible for single polymers and in a polymer sample the average doubt and you do not see any effective optical activity for that optically active conformation.	959.0965389668679
This is the actual input to the reactor and this is the exit stream which is going f1qc and this undergoes change in the concentration.	124.41568602326386
The suitability of enzyme thermister depends on the enthalpy changes associated with the biochemical reaction.	380.9286897450865
Obviously , they will prefer because r is up.	394.5955464430344
For a given concentration would be higher if the size of the polymer goes up , so if you if you add same amount polymers of different molecular weight , in the same solvent at same temperature , then the polymer which have the hard molecular weight or higher size , it will have , the solution will have higher viscosity.	141.25316743736403
All the three substrates which are listed here are bulk fermentation products.	407.1352890053485
If you want to prove in a reaction , if you promote the reaction , you know find out what is the size of this your polymer particles or so on , so i hope you understood this emulsion polymerization part.	261.51424658256116
So , the impact behavior of glass is basically poor so , the glass impact behavior and modulus does not always match with each other.	992.0742322876662
Now , if you compare different temperature , so you take polystyrene at 25 degree centigrade , and polystyrene at 70 degree centigrade; obviously , temperature goes up you expect that , the restriction for single bond rotation will be coming down , because you have more kinetic energy , because higher temperature , obviously , the rotational the restriction around the single bond would come down.	417.8834310168976
Now , that is because you have large difference in size of a solvent molecule , and the polymer molecule , because the size difference you get this large increase in the viscosity of the solvent , and that increase the extent of increase by addition of a polymer molecule.	77.53726214293538
A major question that will come is what do we mean by immobilization.	637.827084258962
Again , n b is n a by r p n a which gives us n a 1 by r minus p.	35.661581161746575
So , if you have monomers which are very different in their polarity of the double bond , then they will tend to form alternate copolymers.	50.894319533791936
So , from the single data of m n and the structure , you know all others p is close to .	72.45961067634659
So the cell should not contain any interfering enzyme.	85.08524367040891
This was the major contribution which for a long time was valid until the time another major contribution which came in the enzyme kinetics was by briggs and haldane in 192.	1232.2345652679148
For e you again have only one pattern that is k2, k1a and k4 and that will be e0 ( k1k2k4 a ).	549.9834847710149
This as you know , this , this is the standard enthalpy of polymerization reaction and this is standard entropy of the polymerization and this is standard state for monomer is considered.	293.05576153488107
So , they are dissolved at a high temperature and the column and the escaped at a higher temperature , and the separation is performed at that higher temperature.	151.97275377819653
So that is one feature.	53.720169596796936
So , the chain keep on propagating there is no reaction between two monomers or there is no reaction between two high molecular polymer chain as well.	267.675300805412
One limitation will be that the product has to be a low molecular product.	255.1382733855238
There are hundreds of polymer goes in those applications.	41.57091851600416
So we come at now , only to radical polymerization.	591.3470613162319
In those cases the binding of the substrate to the enzyme will depend upon the ionization state of the substrate.	17.096409973572992
High temperature gpc s are required for crystalline polymer; crystalline polymers are not typically soluble in room temperature.	1165.2065889733333
In many cases the immobilization process might involve the reduction in the access of the substrate molecule to the enzyme active site.	74.5759417849261
This is a pure amorphous polymers so , the drop in elastic modulus or modulus after t g and this is a rubber with cross linking.	183.15016147093536
A characteristic example of these kinds of enzymes is hexokinase.	1089.169551715731
It should be too low.	102.84135925827647
It will imply or it will also be a very logical conclusion that the faster reactions , if the reaction has to go very fast rate , then they must have larger value of k *.	260.3375264801422
Now , let us begin or continue our discussion on molecular weight , molecular weight of the polymer produced in radical chain polymerization.	15.059190929261185
And we can use so many things and these mixtures take one from here and one from here and constitute the ziegler - natta initiators.	190.10110196132544
Now of course , you cannot throughout all the solvents unit solvent recovery and recyclic which is a very hazardous for this.	499.17246017095647
But for linear flexible chains , it will be between 0.5 to 0.8 and for theta condition what we have seen earlier for theta condition , what is the value of a s or expansion factor for theta condition efficient.	782.732988731273
So , from this point to the further onwards , is a plastic deformation happening , below this elastic deformation is happening , this is called yield point.	835.8265173586836
Only the p is high; if it is p is 0.98, may be 90 percent of the function groups has reacted , you get 50; x n is 5.	1460.1303267650846
Then what will happen , again the intramolecular intramolecular intersections or intramolecular long range interactions will try to expand.	215.77037669211
And if you have computed system like copolymers blend , we require more than one detector to fully characterize to fully determine molecular weight of those.	1362.2328314876013
So , not only we can find out the molecular weight , we can find out the conversion from monomer to polymer , and also if we add the second monomer to form a block , then we can get the information about the composition of the block , as well as the length of the all the molecular weight of individual block.	47.42692691053735
We have seen in our discussion , when we were doing this as stress strain curve , we have seen that the curve stress stain curve depends upon the temperature , as well as the strain rate.	148.10694074939028
These are the examples of big polymer industry where the the companies make the polymers in very large quantity , where the the applications where polymers find you know minor like examples i said where polymers are synthesized and added as a active or secondary ingredient in other formulations , those polymers are typically made by the smaller companies and they are taken , they are synthesized by the smaller companies.	1249.3963378250287
They could also be conjugated proteins.	161.51421243559082
Because the enzyme is entrapped it does not have any interactions or modifications or involvement or coupling of the amino acid residues of the protein molecules with that of the matrix of the immobilize enzyme preparation and therefore the sole force that keeps the enzyme molecules bound to the matrix is the porous network and purely by molecular size.	423.68658789710196
