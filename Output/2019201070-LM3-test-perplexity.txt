So , the reactivities are not different.	50.85484220849353
Then as a result , i theta will be less than i theta equals to .	76.34293942805196
We will come back to the general features of chain polymerization , we by this time you know that , we can build linear polymers in chain polymers from a mono functional group.	111.86691956953122
If your side reaction is forming some molecules , which act as a chain stopper , which is like act as end of mono - functional group , if your side reactions are producing some molecules , which are mono - functional , which act as chains stopper , then it will harm your building up the molecular.	342.1546886622342
Consider the frequency of energy of excited oscillator by quantum mechanics you get e = h.	326.5706370563869
Say , let us take example of styrene , polymerization of styrene by or chloric acid hclo 4 solvent is a mixture of ccl 4 and ethylene dichloride.	640.725616039109
Except for that difference there will be no difference and the reaction profile will be hyperbolic in nature and one can examine such a situation in the case of a variety of identical independent subunits.	363.5431683437847
So , the chain initiation takes place leaving a time during almost during inter polymerization time and the propagations step is faster.	972.5889914869473
So , r t , rate of termination is given by the concentration of now , for simplicity just write , like the earlier case where in case of radical polymerization let us write this only , m plus so , this is the summation of concentration of all the cationic species present in the reaction medium , m 1, m 2, m 3 and so on.	87.91456548660366
Another thing which also has been checked experimentally , another factor which influences the reactor performance as a result of pore diffusion is the effect of increasing the enzyme loading.	125.37281373748661
We discussed different types of radical initiators , thermal initiators , photochemical initiators , redox initiators.	544.1744926452562
And again all the sides is blocked.	79.67233090058576
A solution of this will give you the substrate concentration profile in the pore or inside the particle.	81.8170505695848
In the case of mixed inhibition , the degree of inhibition will be largely dependent upon the magnitude of a.	26.469768901894742
That is one thing.	57.153348943843426
And then going to different types of tacticity possible in polymers , how to analyze those tacticity and how we control or we can preferentially synthesize a polymer with desired tacticity.	756.726911493921
We can set t is equal to t c and theta is equal to theta c at t is equal to t c chi is equal to chi c , we can write from this , minus psi 1 minus theta t c to half minus chi c.	318.41886836435583
The inhibition constant that is the reversible binding of enzyme with the inhibitor and the corresponding dissociation constant is equivalent to the concentration of inhibitor that doubles the slope of initial reaction velocity that is inverse double reciprocal plot 1 / v verses 1 / s plot.	200.1945225268983
Now , you know as a matter of fact that this does not exist as such independently because it exclusively exists at its tautomer of acetyl diode , but because this polymer looks like that it has been synthesized from a hypothetical monomer like this , this is this polymer is generally named as polyvinyl alcohol.	362.9564891850754
Now , because reaction is very fast you saw the rate constant of the reaction is very high.	21.909575733185036
Let us see one of the strategies in the next page.	85.36376798037163
If suppose the entire enzyme ses is in this form , both these sites are totally saturated because es and se also will lead to the product formation.	379.64503824939385
The specificity can have a very large variety and one must also appreciate that the specificity of these enzymes in terms of their catalytic action is attributed to the active sites.	123.00818220703465
So , that , they , we can classify the polymers in several ways.	134.6358144164329
At best the extremes of those cases under zero and first order but we have not considered the inhibition pattern , we have not considered the deactivation kinetics , mass transfer limitations and non - ideal flow behavior.	124.74782039282708
The situation can be slightly improved if you make intermittent feeding of the line; for example you use a plug flow reactor in which the feeding is done at more than one point.	833.892630892086
It will be mixture of that , but average will be say , a dimer for an equilibrium constant of 1 and for an equilibrium constant of 10 to the power 2 order.	441.9370616271406
We will discuss those aspects subsequently.	176.60453325088142
M 2 dot is r m m dot , this is r m m m dot , and so on.	210.6976512114788
In the case of recycle reactor as you notice here although it s a packed bed reactor but just to increase the linear flow velocity to overcome the external film diffusion we may like to have a recycle stream so that the linear flow velocity is increased but ultimately it will end up in non - ideality from the plug flow behavior.	164.59887792168416
That means racemic mixture of amino acids , d - acylamino acid.	617.233087597896
Now , this produces again m n bar m n 1 plus if we write , and this produce a bar plus x m n x.	730.705892264524
Here because the substrates are more than one there are many possibilities for interaction between the substrate and the enzyme molecules and so therefore these dotted figures indicate a variety of interactions that are involved.	262.18051483175225
If one catalyst works on a variety of reactions the life is simple as happens in the case of chemical catalyst.	157.7074390045401
So , this is very common , this is very important termination process and it could be , this termination could happen to one of the , or any of the other agent as well.	103.88926225266238
So , if you look at this expression here and we know k s c is this and esr is this.	67.14123850147686
Sometimes , it come other form as well like in emulsions.	1012.1040516558016
It is a question of debate whether this amount of water required is to maintain the essential water layer in equilibrium or there are some other catalytic functions which require water molecules by the enzyme because so far if you look into reaction mechanisms of enzymes excepting for maintaining the enzymes structure , water has not been seen to play any role.	1688.5932822484856
So , different polymers response to these factors will be differently , so there is no uniformity condition as i was just mentioning.	868.403785444435
That means you need different enzymes to act on different substrates or to produce a particular product different enzymes are needed.	558.8982499780291
Ammonia is produced and the ammonia then is absorbed into dilute acid solution which is titrated and the quantity of amino generated can be calculated.	687.1348780107464
So , this alpha methyl styrene has a minimum of del h value.	32.01684914100067
That means if the distribution , if it passes almost like a plug flow behavior or like a cstr one can then compare the two patterns and see whether the flow pattern in the actual reactor is ideal or what is the extent of ideality.	310.48134195161737
But all these methods have a unique linkage or they have been standardized right from beginning in a more basic fundamental method what we know as kjeldhal method.	1058.2135995770996
Now , this is a case where the individual molecules are small in size , they are not entangled with each other.	94.90514542308247
Now , this is again giving the same information as we got in earlier cases , in earlier discussion.	346.2496885155174
So , if i write m n dot here , and this is m m dot , and this reaction is k termination by disproportionation , then it gives again m n plus m m.	72.39056887562433
That means neither they are substrate may or may not be products and such molecules are called effector molecules.	1597.0383500667544
So , these are the three criteria of a very good flame resistance polymer.	148.19402211883173
Electrostatic interaction it can bind if you have a negatively charged protein.	846.1331462311249
And you can have a c o , you can a c o o c , let us put it b make it , and you can have , so three types of carbonate possible , this one , this three , 1, 2, 3, now this peak we can find out from a homo polycarbonate of a , this one from homo polycarbonate b.	674.2347424611702
And obviously , you cannot add all these for every polymer.	206.13133660489345
The hydrogen bonding between two sections of the polypeptide chain can form beta pleated sheet and because the poly peptide chain has polarity , either parallel or anti parallel , beta sheet can be formed and you come across in any given protein sample the alpha helix as well as beta pleated sheet structures very commonly.	2206.0343748251757
Any factor or any parameter which increases the frequency of these collisions between the molecules will tend to increase the rate of reaction.	391.5454372699955
So , as i said 95 percent , more than 95 percent of the monomer present as large droplets , now large droplet size , this droplet size is about say 1 to 100 micron which has quite large compared to the sizes of the surfactant micelle.	470.1756589794686
The permeability is define has the product of , solvability of a gas or vapor , in the polymer matrix , and its diffusion co - efficient.	684.60129914782
The ductility also come down along with increasing in the modulus , by this nano - fillers and thermal stability may be sometime also questionable because this might being some impurities along with this fillers.	1440.9988954782334
Now , these two are quite close to each other.	28.01494267343817
Now we just learn that , when light falls; say in a plastic material , or any material , there could be three possible phenomena happen; one is , the scattering are reflection from surface , second is , the scattering bulk scattering , and the third is your absorption.	599.878912891033
In the case of histidine the bond formed is acylimidazole; lysine forms schiff s base and aspartic and glutamic acid form anhydride bonds and these anhydride bonds then can be attacked by the second substrate.	2985.612821646466
So surface area will also become quite important.	383.7642527598459
That is what usually is followed.	102.92417175947189
Unless you have a new structure from a new monomer then you have to name , there is no common name existing.	275.2176536269109
Where we have seen that , entropy of mixing is given by k t n one l n 5 1 n 2 l n 5 2 remember , we did this expression and of polymer solution where , n 1 is the number of molecules of component 1, n 2 his for component 2 and 5 1 and 5 2 are the volume fraction of first component and second component.	963.6541801237156
Activation volume is the change in volume from either monomer goes from monomer state to transition state.	664.7788115999953
So , this diminishing of the excess rayleigh ratio at a higher angle than 0 is because of the destructive interference between the scattered light from different parts of same molecule or as a result of intra molecular destructive interference; and the higher is the angle , the excess rayleigh ratio becomes even smaller.	367.4362761830242
If m is greater than one fourth , so as the m m tryad; then obviously , it is predominantly towards this giving going towards a isotactic.	496.3784704093572
So , how do you get this rate of polymerization.	12.866474543160287
What if the concentration of the monomer is very high 60 percent , then there is a gel effect.	69.66406542032027
However , can you make take a say 3 member ring or a 4 member ring or say 5 member ring.	450.19606301391855
We already defined a term interaction , flory - huggins polymer solvent interaction , parameter chi was defined as z minus 2 k t.	407.28421317032735
As you know enzymes are primarily very complex molecules and we had also looked into the complexity of the situation as regards to their catalyses , as regards to their specificity.	2098.7094787152737
And vigorous starting converts the monomer containing initiator into strong small droplets of 100 to 500 microns , and because dispersant presence which are very small amount 0.1 weight percent.	1331.7233490930116
So , this 2 terms we introduced.	123.76097104137939
Now , most cases usually polymer and carbon backbone , so it has a theta between 90 to 180 which means cos theta is negative; so as expected this will be more than the end - to - end distance , rms end - to - end distance restriction from bond angle will be higher than the end - to - end distance for freely rotating chain.	186.25303789943698
The enzyme will not be able to provide the catalytic function.	13.843320919968043
So , if you want to decrease the flammability , you basically have to remove this combustible gas , from the system , and basically has to reduce , when the heat formation , heat generation on bonding this polymeric materials.	427.9117600360833
When i say unfolding i am not referring to total deactivation but minor modification in the conformation which extends its total volume or total surface area.	989.0098143816253
As a matter of fact this is an artificial cell as you can consider let us say living cell itself.	209.13238673051387
But the mechanism like environmental effect is provided by very specific enzymes only.	1414.033149914009
Now k increases with the value of a for flexibility; typically you have seen it has been seen that k also increases with the increase in the value of a and it is typically around this range.	190.25343141869473
In next lecture onwards , what we will do.	26.481694039490623
It is actually m n is x n multiplied by the average molecular weight of the structural unit , not the repeat unit and we also discussed the kinetics of step polymerization.	47.09130077438639
So , we can just simply write x n as k p m k t k ts chain transfer to the counter ion , chain transfer to the monomer and chain transfer to the solvent or any other substance or you can add , if they are other chain transfer reactions present.	161.33255789431186
So , basically , what am what we need to know that because of , the high molecular weight of the polymers , the entropy of mixing is not contributing significantly to the energy of mixing.	46.03393611477074
So , the nullify is that precipitating , and in case of non solvent when polymer segregates , gibbs free energy mixing is positive , the polymer is insoluble , and chi , the polymer solvent interaction polymer solvent is higher than .	1005.1310222579906
This chi is a temperature dependent dimensionless quantity , which is just defined like this to remove all the information from the lattice.	1554.6385735379938
The advantage of the situation is that usually the methods based on adsorption results in high yields.	99.38403056672053
Most the data points will be rather concentrated near the origin where as weightage at a low substrate concentration will be very , very low.	149.6396347726272
Now , if i write equilibrium is constant for this reaction , this is m dot.	34.18204438480966
Now , so anything , if monomer is stabilized , then del h , magnitude of del h will come down.	316.48186649636085
Now , what is the temperature of the reaction.	7.110371647172883
So , at any point of time it could be 1 radical or it could be 0 radical , it can ever have more than 1 radical , because as soon as the second radical gets into the this medium or this polymer particle , they will the 2 radicals will terminate will do the bimolecular reaction and terminate.	330.81227862346645
For most of the analysis , to understand the system either we simplify it to a zero order design and experimental data can be collected either at a very low substrate concentration range or at very high substrate concentration.	273.0567155979519
Particularly it will be more important when we are talking of continuous operation where the reactor operation time is large enough the deactivation constant will also play a key role.	337.7445716963983
So , generally reactions are down at ambient temperature or may be slightly higher than ambient temperature solvent is very important , even more in case of anionic polymerization you can , the solvents are mainly used is aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons.	624.2867705842795
So , there is is a tendency to copolymerize all the time.	114.9013822500446
As you have seen that with decrease in temperature we get preferentially syndiotactic formation; if we increase the temperature we get atactic formation.	332.13037226094053
You have other methods which are based on dye binding or silver binding method where the protein can bind certain molecules and the binding is assayed quantitatively and expressed in terms of protein content.	762.0829561567857
If there is a mixture it is always a isotactic polymerization.	50.75194327677399
So , you can mention any of this symbol or you can simply mention m n.	267.80185208667507
This is your k2b , k - 2, this is k3, and this is k.	567.0732346436245
Similarly one can express the co - operativity index of any given allosteric enzyme by expressing it in terms of the ratio of substrate concentration for achieving two different levels of reaction velocity.	362.1847624172243
L or it implies that kappm will be equal to km ..	354.68144318788654
Ph = 0.43e.	1349.1438419129067
So you , if you do this reaction in lower temperature , nonpolar medium with a lithium plus type small counter ion , you can get highly isotactic polymers.	382.4642441275932
In our earlier lecture we have noted that enzymes can lower the free energy of activation of a reaction very effectively as compared to chemical catalyst.	88.13237029429706
So in this case , this oscillating dipole width emits radiation or electromagnetic radiation at all direction which are the scattered light.	594.5692661727265
And as i said repeatedly in case of step polymers you get the high molecular weight only at high conversion where in case of chain polymers you can get high molecular weight even at low conversion , with time or with conversion only the number of high molecular weight chains or the amount of high molecular chain increases.	157.8709371663166
As i mentioned earlier the enzyme molecule is surrounded by water layer and this water layer is essential for the enzyme conformation and activity.	255.17862153312691
That , which we get , if we do reaction in the nonpolar medium at low temperature and with a , as a small counter ion , then there will be a possibility of a strong coordination between the monomer and the active chain end and the counter ion; which will makes sure that the monomer , the incoming monomer gets into the chain from one side and which will produce a isotactic polymerization , isotactic polymers.	183.06434675981546
They can be glassy or elastomer.	222.1533136703936
If you distribute on the total product formation that cost contribution is very , very small.	178.94942661853943
So , leaving anionic polymerization is quite often easily achieved compared to a living cationic polymerization.	145.83206559583664
What about , what happens is , rest of the radicals which do not generate or initiate chain polymers.	189.03132677869104
Now in case of metalist , now what i have not talked till now that this is heterogeneous polymerization.	232.31085084129592
If i just show in some colors , different colors , you can have two networks inter twingled each other.	514.6952311040233
If you take butadiene this molecule which does not have any substitution and isoprene which has a large substitution , then if we do a free radical reaction at 20 degree centigrade , you get the trans product higher.	250.96882060054875
The other way could be and which is probably more important for assay of an enzyme is its catalytic function.	408.30993642225724
But in the case of immobilized enzyme preparation which are regulated by diffusional limitations the curve usually convex to the 1 / s axis.	74.7986471112363
So , in that case or if you have a cyclic polymer where there is no ends , then end to end distance is also not possible.	177.19841545150572
They , they preferred , they are , they prefer to be in surface.	132.78071841744475
Assume like in the first case that the enzyme possesses only one ionisable amino acid residues.	128.02005042260296
Now , these were subject to a , heating conditions for 96 hours at 180 degree centigrade and 95 degree erratic immunity.	2409.528805260593
In the case of a plug flow reactor you have a recycle system so that have an external loop in which the ph monitoring and control is exercised or otherwise in the ideal plug flow behavior the ph control is difficult.	779.5810618065829
We can , we will find this type of general , this type of general curve.	277.6265583282704
The unperturbed dimension is because of , the bond angle restriction and the bond rotation restriction , now you cannot have a more compact chain than that , for linear chain you cannot have a situation where there is more compact.	218.707057438012
Of the two amino acid residues one has pka three and one has pka ten , just a typical profile which you get.	565.2664522674388
So , what we are doing.	14.496831923952845
So , s 2 for the pure polymer we can get from this expression just by putting n 1 is .	155.03172748942333
While the choice of the batch reactor is primarily based on many factors other than the reactor performance mainly on the basis of the additional requirements of the reaction.	247.52227702626766
An incident beam is bombarded on a sample cell which contains these polymer molecules polymer solutions and then the scattered light is detected; the intensity of the scattered light is detected at an angle theta with the incident beam.	1071.416575991699
If you assume that there is some kind of deviation from ideality and in the case of cstr the kind of deviation could be of two types.	49.126392395257916
Now , in case there is another molecular weight defined m z which is m i cube m i square , this is m z and sometimes viscosity is used as to determine the molecular weight which gives you viscosity average molecular weight m v which is all the expressions are similar , close to each other.	305.05342752154996
The inhibition patterns obtained for bisubstrate reactions gives you lot of information about the binding pattern of different substrate or the sequence of binding of the different substrate in the case of a multisubstrate reaction.	307.0616349355344
For example , if we add a polystyrene anion , we can add water and this chain gets terminated and you get oh minus , which is , this is a very weakly nucleophile , so it cannot further initiate anionic chain.	414.64097477690996
So , that it he can design a process whereby he can effectively remove the heat generated due to the polymer reaction so that reaction remain isothermal during the polymerization process.	376.9573847863136
For example , if i take very commonly used example , like a i b n and benzyl peroxides , said b p o , benzyl peroxide , and if i write the values of t half , t half then let us have these numbers.	260.4532365223222
This 2 path is shown here.	87.86726569745608
Everything goes in line and interacts with different fingers and one can be comfortable and the reaction can proceed.	1780.1633224292384
You can land up in same polymer along with different small molecules or it can be , these polyamides can be synthesized by self condensation amino acids which will make polypeptides.	809.0524880265779
So , and this crystalline regions are formed by different polymer chains.	64.46159782257124
So , they have least reactivity towards a particular polymer radical.	67.112179519747
It will never be more than .	15.251845853799535
If you consider the reactor performance in terms of zero order or first order kinetics and if you take any substrate concentration of the feed and carry out the substrate conversion to very high level then you will have the overall reactor performance which is much closer to a first order kinetics.	81.0295533249513
For examples , this pure polyolefins like polyethylenes , polypropylenes , they oxidize very rapidly.	3892.239858812264
So , this is your expression for gibbs free energy of mixing gibbs free energy.	55.62383700239824
Carbohydrates or proteins are known to generate immunogenic reactions in the body whereas nylon is relatively inert as far as the immunogenecity is concerned and these capsules have been used for treatment of leukemia.	1830.6827875403844
For example if you consider an adsorb preparation some of the enzyme is weakly bound which gets dissolved very fast and then the really adsorbed enzyme preparation shows you a normal decay.	1040.4188678674275
So , what will we do.	25.46094955208249
Now , remember in the step polymerization case , what was a x n bar or average degrees of polymerization , again it was number of monomer molecules polymerized divided by the number of molecules present at the end of the reaction.	34.15616899860917
This stability is not only in terms of use but also during storage and this parameter is usually expressed in terms of half life.	600.2265795621795
N is the total number of molecules present at time t , which is given by the total number of molecule minus pn 0 has earlier , so n 0 1 minus p , where n 0 the number of monomers in the beginning.	105.5311853736361
This is primarily based on the acid base catalysis or covalent catalysis , a feature which is common to that of chemical catalysis.	141.30138501216652
The other group of matrices is porous matrices , the most preferred kind of material that are used for industrial applications and these matrices are control pore glass , control pore titanium and variety of other synthetic tailored materials which have been produced commercially for generating a high porosity for coupling of enzymes on them.	1470.3163652090493
Now , this is the rate of transfer rate constant for transfer by the original rate of propagation is , we are writing transfer coefficient or transfer coil constant.	116.64188901268774
As you notice here this is the storage tank for the racemic mixture which comes from chemical synthesis.	756.9445481487957
As i mentioned earlier two specific cases demonstrate where the effectiveness factor can be more than one.	40.09891784987003
These are the types of the enzymes which fall in the category of absolute specificity.	59.576031458475505
As a result , you will get drift in the copolymer composition as well.	7.636388812334434
Now , del s is , del h we know is basically the difference in the activation for the propagation reaction and the depropagation reaction.	149.36778308877166
So , high volume molecular weight , it gives the mechanical properties.	69.93566143110186
Also k - 1 / k2 ratio of two rate constants k2 and k - 1that means the ratio of two rate constants which is involved in the break down of the es complex , either es complex can go to product formation or it can go back to substrate complex.	976.3399083373745
Initially if the ph alteration is mild if you go beyond a certain level of ph change you might observe only reversible change and therefore the enzyme can be brought back to a native confirmation but if you further change the ph it might undergo to a irreversible inactivation and which may not be possible to bring back.	1671.36861902181
Dt k1e0 s ( k1s + k - 1 + k2 ) x if you just solve it you will get a logarithmic term and the solution will be ln [ k1e0s - ( k1s + k - 1 + k2 ) x ] = t + a - ( k1s + k - 1 + k2 ) let us say alpha is the constant for integration.	414.87154319287134
For example , we can choose; from this set , we can choose say triethyl aluminum or tri diethyl aluminum chloride or diethyl zinc , and from this we can say titanium , titanium chloride , tetrachloride , trichloride.	3150.4099540761904
So , the fraction of the initiators produced during the decomposition of the thermal initiator or some other process , which actually initiate the radicals , we call the terms initiator efficiency.	217.1527274373422
So , you have to put this monomer term within bracket.	147.92025736039434
So , what is assumed.	89.69785264287205
In lyases an additive enzyme which catalyses the elimination reactions that result in the double bond formation is used.	564.57620256952
Other two is engineering polymers and high performance polymers and if the price in these three , the volume goes up like this.	993.6214192776835
So , which actually gives you isotactic polymers and we write this as m m; so meso pair and another meso pair.	58.26824838239847
So , basically now from this thermodynamic data we know that it is easy ring open polymerize easy to carry out ring opening polymerization on 3, 4 member ring and say 7 ring.	586.2515207461308
So , if you replace one of the molecules , say , solute molecules or solvent molecules with another one , there should not be any change in the energy of the systems.	72.03034446500226
Say , for example , this one , case one; if we take a water vapor and then the water , just consider water , liquid water and then cool it down.	908.819854264452
But both the products are crosslinked preparations and are useful.	1448.5995597179456
So , these; so , r p now given up , given by k p rate constant for all those individual steps , monomer concentration , and this is the summation of the concentration of all the propagating radicals of the , all the chain radicals; this is the sum of all those things.	253.78546518853213
So , you first identify the polymer , look at the polymer and identify which class it it belongs and then name accordingly from which this polymers is synthesized.	851.7048585126673
The same enzyme , the same reaction , the same conversion factor but the quantity of enzyme required in cstr will be much , much higher compared to pfr.	42.3617122998965
This is polyethylene oxide which is actually what it is , this is ethylene oxide and you get a polymer from this like this.	337.39864032358
So , basically we know how to get a syndiotactic polymer and we know how to get a atactic polymer.	18.478325241412648
That means the free enzyme molecule will be inactive or has a very low activity.	109.95110189914466
So , there is some char formation as happened in case of pvc.	165.0309894780131
The second candidate in the case of immobilized enzyme is carriers.	119.81171503987359
So , tendency of the solvents for transfer reaction for vinyl acetate is higher compared to a polymer reaction of styrene.	104.24608369386063
The equilibrium is allowed to be reached over a period of time.	76.5581950353901
These strain developed may contribute towards the reduction in activation energy but it is a result of binding process.	242.73108052235662
Normally a residence time distribution , a c curve will be of this type.	147.69909714610733
It has an additional carboxylic group.	84.69610934579305
The very first step in such a procedure as proposed by wong and hans is that we need to write any reaction mechanism in a cyclic form.	201.36090423539437
Let us write the propagation step , write this generic expression.	137.37998074070876
So , at 80 degree itself it is deforming , which means it should not be used.	99.1464785206472
The role of regulatory enzymes in a metabolic pathway is the control of metabolic pathway.	91.25869611897684
So , heat generation is high rate and as a result local heat formation takes place coloration and degradation takes place.	523.5657953232369
And some other properties like anisotropic and all good electrical properties you can get as a result of crystalline regions.	368.9862142177762
So , let us , we have discussed enough earlier , we can blend by just mechanical mixing , we can do solution mixing as well we can dissolve those two polymers in a cosolvent and then form a film.	1161.8577647324014
One of the major patterns is where the thermal deactivation or the loss of enzyme activity during continuous use is independent of substrate concentration.	163.16336484341238
Although bulk of the hydrophobic residues are buried inside the residue of enzyme but still on the surface there are very small hydrophobic patches which can be used here for immobilizing on to the surface of a hydrophobic carrier; carriers like polypropylene beads.	1397.6959576336064
In the bio process design , some of the basic design principles for the enzyme catalyzed processes.	389.6960839454228
So , these are the some examples , which we are , which you can which you can now convince that there is a tendency in this copolymer.	120.26820245615774
That means un - competitive , non - competitive or a linear mix and the linear mix was a case of non - competitive inhibition.	343.1487536360945
We will talk about anti - oxidants and how they are , how they function in a polymer metrics.	107.82155554480545
So , again , every temperature you can consider as ceiling temperature.	53.002582265909375
In the case of mixed inhibition they are not identical but they have a magnitude and both are related by ratio of a and which determines the degree of inhibition.	99.851083058799
It also gives a number of inferences about reaction mechanisms and the current accepted rate expressions for enzyme catalyzed reactions involve a hypothesis where enzyme substrate complex has to be formed.	396.4291130877038
The independent subunits or the independent binding site implies that binding to one site does not bring in any conformational change so as to change affinity of other binding sites.	2826.4708903988612
So , it determine the del h value determined by the stabilization of the this double bond.	97.57074671949611
As we all know that proteins retain their native confirmation within a limited ph range , because electrostatic interactions , which are a major force , non - covalent force are involved in the confirmation of the enzyme molecule.	209.35754363651873
Examples of deliberately added chain transfer agent is like h s c 4 h 9, if you are considering a reaction with styrene , this can initiate further chain.	1438.665788075235
It predominantly consists of some hydrophobic active sites , all the residues whereby the micro environment provided for the reaction is hydrophobic and really it is away from the bulk aqueous environment of the enzyme.	1683.2522949532645
So when we apply the integrated michaelis menten equation for looking at the performance of an immobilized enzyme reactor in the batch mode we must keep in mind that it only gives you an approximate situation just to tell the sizing of the vessels required for a particular enzyme catalyzed reaction and to compare the soluble enzyme with that of immobilized enzyme performance.	428.72504202852815
Ultimately it can reach the same kind of saturation behavior but the initial profile will be different in the case of a sigmoidal profile.	249.57350737640442
So , we can write this.	3.498913656773674
Chain polymerization could be other types as well , for example polymers using , type of , other type of catalyst like catalyst , and also it could be , different other types which are not the majority , or a major class of chain polymerization , but they also are part of the group of chain polymerization; for example ring - opening polymerization , group - transfer polymerization and so on.	493.28055133259943
There is no strain of these groups.	152.08374171838193
This can also be made from another variation of these monomers like diamines and diacyl chloride.	543.5587786650452
The typical application which reversed is where the enzyme is immobilized on the collagen matrix in the form of thin films and you get a very long roll.	135.37845021797003
Now , in this case we are writing double arrow which means this reversible reaction.	54.51773875423891
The active site is usually located in a cleft or crevice.	1368.1313419852029
This time emulsion is extruded through a spinneret just like you make nylon fibers and pass through a fine spinneret and the extruded fibers or the filaments are then dipped into a liquid coagulant like toluene or petroleum ether.	3956.8441848881794
Now , as we discussed if you have a cyclic ring here , then you need first to ring open the ring to open up and then start the propagation reaction.	129.67617896169017
For their use as a industrial catalyst the important factors which have to be kept in mind are the yield of enzyme from native source; the original enzyme itself has to be chosen which is desirable for any industrial process both interms of operational characteristics as well as the effect of other impurity or other conditions which prevail in the feed stream.	1040.8908692422933
From this expression you can see , you can write the other , similar to other expressions as well , which gives you e transfer s minus e p by rt square from this expression.	267.1528938355763
So , pdi goes up little lower.	72.66275033442516
So therefore if let us say b is very large , b tends to infinity then v0 = vm . a / ka + a both from numerator and denominator divide by v some of the terms will be cancelled and you will end up with a simple expression like michaelis menten.	836.171833808949
If you are still not convinced , if you think what you do once you wake up from bed you take a brush which is made up of plastic material , you use the toothpaste which contain polymer molecules , you take food , foods are also having natural polymers , the container sometimes we use , disposable plastics and you wear shirts , clothes which are made of polyesters , cottons these are all examples of polymers.	1738.7999077675972
This effect can also be visualized when you look for the classical lineweaver plot.	480.8641197488777
And this is the chart or carton gives , typically the range where this ir absorption happen for a particular bond vibrations , like range , n h , in this range , see triple bond in then comes this say c over double bonds comes around here.	3645.4357430333666
Now , how do you think that these polymers are formed.	57.58992131044543
That means we are talking at the rate when there is no product formation.	163.95060922516757
If you consider all the three explanations that we have considered today like oxtens three site interaction model , lock and key mechanism of fischer or induced fit hypothesis of koshland , when we talk about the specificity they dont link specificity by any means to the catalytic function.	945.0781839420671
For such a reaction there is a feasibility that you may end up in an enzyme molecule having such kind of a confirmation , instead of having the two carboxylic group of the same substrate molecule bound to the enzyme , there are two substrate molecules bound to the same enzyme and one carboxylic group of each of the substrate molecule and such a complex does not form the product.	135.093743886389
That means a very physical conceptual picture of effectiveness factor can be considered.	74.51467193003658
So , we will we we talking about elastic deformation and plastic deformation , elastic deformation where on a plain releasing the stress , the sample comes up back to the original state and in case of plastic deformation , it it come it come does not come back.	1043.495480515131
So , now , they can do reaction in the water side of the interface , so the reaction become faster.	38.04631491245952
That was the hypothesis he proposed and probably is one of the landmark contributions in the study of enzyme kinetics even today.	647.5444244716459
So , ionic chain polymerization we will consider only when both the initiation and the propagation reaction is by ionic species.	176.0563335645474
That means the inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme.	19.644332644152303
The attraction of the enzyme for the activated complex would thus lead to a decrease in its energy and hence decrease the energy of activation for reaction and to an increase in rate of reaction.	417.45098124313364
It becomes k2 [ a ] [ b ] ( 5 ) or in other words the second order rate constant will be nothing else but k2 = rt / nh k * ( 6 ) again you notice a significant fact here that the rate constant is directly linked.	209.0191426686369
After a very brief induction period the concentration of enzyme substrate complex comes to a steady state.	227.9660864701019
The regeneration of the co - enzyme like in a living cell can be carried out by coupling to enzyme catalyzed reaction , as you see here.	45.71578263851941
So , more and more polymer chains are formed.	46.14210027679616
The specific activity of the enzyme that means the enzyme activity in terms of international units per milligram of protein might get reduced.	107.59408709367166
There is no effect on the km value.	6.61750677332026
Eab will have only one pattern possible because eab is emerging only from the e side via e and ea and it cannot come from ey.	3403.257122637436
For example , we know from our organic chemistry knowledge , that general order , general order of stability of different , of different ring structure follows in the following order , that a ring containing three or four atom in a ring is least stable or lowest , lowest compared to a 5 - membered or 7 to 13 - membered ring , which is even lower stable than 6 - membered or a 14 - membered ring and higher and that we know from our organic chemistry knowledge.	1658.7812205860607
If i take again go back to same polyamide formation.	132.39107506205363
In this case we just talked about the propagation and initiation , propagation and the termination reactions , now there could be transfer reaction , chain transfer reactions as well.	43.68472153147362
So , as simple as that.	67.1079772736257
So , these are the other possible ways of initiating a cationic polymerization.	57.47138157948095
If your temperature is high , then there is this isomerization between this two monomer; these two structures are highly possible.	522.619204574454
If you look at immobilized enzyme reactor performance with external film diffusion that means the substrate may be very thick.	45.434474808971984
So , primary anti oxidant , as you said , as i just mentioned , it traps this r dot and proxy radicals.	172.36267981669167
Now , another side reaction , which is very possible , very prominent in case of methyl methacrylate is as follows , is actually reaction on the monomer , not on the polymer.	162.70492879882738
Then the value of s0 is much , much higher than km.	14.390651151163993
And second , the strain rate , if you think about the application with the material will come up , come across some load , which will come at a higher strain rate , then the behavior will be different , if you talking out just simply dead load bearing capacity of the material.	288.52773423233015
Thermal properties are basically the response of polymeric material , when the temperature increase or heat is supplied to the polymeric material.	484.3787885169371
The monomer approaches this active side and coordinates.	2906.4298545055117
So , one end is here.	33.07978835750429
This is just an illustrative example but a similar example can be sited from a variety of reactions that can be carried out both by chemical catalysis as well as by enzymatic catalysis and the conclusions are almost same.	515.7560176701678
Now it is said that , if the monomers or if the chain end , the active chain end whether it is a cation or anion , if they are free with the with the counter ion and the active chain end , if they are free , then we have seen what are the types of stereochemistry we are going to get.	38.09194145074948
So , you get the pdi higher than .	47.644480752093344
We talked about the backbone of these polymers.	29.033944062479076
And typically this scattered lights have same frequency as the incident light but there are cases where there are shift in the frequency of the scattered light than in comparison to the incident light , but those are called inelastic scattering but for this determination of molecular , we will restrict to only through elastic scattering where the frequency of the scattered light is same as the frequency of the incident light.	403.34641312645493
I am writing if you confuse.	605.347806237908
Now , how can we achieve this.	27.51295029432309
So , in general , we can write that it general.	18.61584631066322
All these functions are also basically carried out by a living cell.	156.3001649505346
So what is done in this experiment; the sample and the reference which is just a blank.	112.20720611560951
Now , because we are talking about initiation by ionic initiator so you have those different types of species , covalent specious between the ion and counter ion with it present as a covalence specious or ion pair or free ion goes different types of association between the reaction center and the possible.	1547.8300709699847
So , the chains will not be able to slice easily and you will have a soft polypropylene which is of no use in practical sense.	178.25145367301266
We also need very highly pressure sensitive equipment because the osmotic value of osmotic pressure is quite low so that we can accurately determine the osmotic pressure.	696.5929340272489
That is one of the diagnostic tools.	46.72574509298921
Now , the monomer gets coordinated form pi complex with the vacant d - orbital.	35.841810797782536
The others , other secondary and branching reaction can also happen; secondary and branching reactions , hydro peroxide can give other radical; if r is tertiary , tertiary , if r has alpha hydrogen.	1036.4237925496325
Now , with this , we will in this discussion living radical polymerization , what you will do is quickly go through different commercial polymerization.	115.12634629853125
You have the vm term , you have the kb term and you have ka term.	520.0696376535677
That means they are reactive to the monomer.	40.877315239922154
Another application sector is bioseparations; the typical example is affinity separation which is based on the covalent coupling of one of the ligand for effecting the separation process.	796.310224347166
That means the substrate can go into the vicinity of the enzyme and product can go out and ultimately the product stream can be taken out but the enzyme cannot go out of the ultra filtration tubes and such a reaction system has an advantage that you can use such a system as a continuous plug flow reactors even using the soluble enzymes.	147.89458489211123
If you consider let us say e + a + b , same as what we are talking about reaction between a and b.	39.72945339231958
You will notice that the two things like thorell and chance mechanism and the ping - pong mechanism in some way might show analogy.	214.40053630770385
More volume for commodity polymers , performance goes up in this direction.	2018.2487440856914
So , you start from one end and you continually adding the further bonds in 3 d specific way , just showing a two d picture here , where you imagine this is in three dimensional.	1132.6564931382625
So , basically , we know , what are the step in oxidation process or to oxidation processes.	150.18199242482368
So , what happen in this stage ii , what is happing in stage ii one more time , monomer is getting into as the polymerization progress , monomer is getting depleted and that is relinquished by the supply of monomer from this droplet via the aqueous medium.	752.6918946281628
That means the structural gene of the particular protein is bound to a repressor molecule and unless an inducer is added it cannot be relieved.	2788.245884827388
Ch y ch 2 gives polymers.	2704.911369577588
Here the ternary complex eab can be formed from only one of the complex ea.	273.55112606504025
So , if i consider the strain stress curve , how does it look like , for a viscous and elastic material.	110.62808077206678
So , ch2 - ch x - ch2 - chx - p.	1292.5157368803837
They must be purified very and because these reaction are very fast reaction , sometimes it happens in seconds and the cationic chains reactions , actually you can make arrangements to , to perform the reaction , you might have to arrange or purify the monomer and the gas nitrogen , argon and you have to make this your container or the reactor moisture free.	748.5930335481438
If it is gets terminated by the disproportionation reactions , we seen earlier; then average degrees of polymerization is nu , because the number of monomers , average numbers of monomers per radical is the size of this chain.	242.70502580202995
From this expression you can get 1 / v = km / k2e0. 1 / sb + 1 / k2e0 in the case of very high substrate concentration in a zero order regime.	84.05151290042383
In the case of plug flow reactor the reactor expression will be s0x ( 1 - km / kp ) - km ln ( 1 - x ) [ 1 + s0 / kp ] = k2e.	80.22675328700512
It forms a cross linked network.	24.06690239841262
If lysine happens to be an amino acid residue at the active site there will be significant loss of activity.	78.53657440347956
Obviously because there will be a dominated cis product.	226.9527431630653
If you are using a polymer powder , and if you want to add liquid , the dispersing , dispersion of the additives in the polymer powder is difficult.	225.9515996583425
So , if you choose to do in a higher temperature then you will always land up in a higher amount of unreacted monomer even if your reaction is complete or reached equilibrium.	123.07406302650604
So , basically interface between those two phases are stitched so that , they are not immiscible to that extent , that they delaminate , but they are not also miscible so , you can get the base properties of those two polymers as well.	663.1563352609508
For example , in case of 1 2 di substitute reaction , then the polymerization becomes difficult.	102.21460066622855
So , according to the definition , just now it should be a addition polymer and not a condensation polymer , but you can clearly see that given a choice , you will probably classify this is more of a condensation polymer rather than addition polymers.	455.5915000428778
The fourth configuration is the immobilization of the enzyme particle on a hydrophobic matrix.	735.4767633729662
Obviously this here , because of short range steric interaction is lower , this will be much stable , much more stable than this is conformation where the short range steric interactions are higher between the two methyl group.	906.3434642156974
Similarly there is increase in optimum temperature; there is decrease in optimum temperature and there are cases where there are no changes also.	282.65136189185716
The third is the estimation of activation energy over a range of temperature.	13.763399226906849
They are present randomly.	70.0200083457393
In the two earlier methods we have talked about the use of a monomer and an oligomer a prepolymer.	378.2539527693098
The reactor performance is under steady state which would mean that the rate of reaction and rate of diffusion are same.	131.186588555405
I am not going in detail in derivation of this process is complicated process.	326.83297215118375
Typically , organic you cannot use organic material for char form , for making a cement char because organic material themselves burn off.	3084.73174480116
This you can arrive at if you put v = 0 and solve it and determine the value of peq.	249.807927005352
Analytical systems also because the quantity of enzyme required are so low that probably the economics rather is always in favor because you save tremendously in the cost of labour.	3880.044609823706
On the other hand if a single enzyme catalyzed reaction is the desired feature , then non - viable cells are desirable and they can be immobilized safely by one of the entrapment methods that we have talked about.	123.11956995573671
For example , block in block nature , but in normal cases , in normal case , step polymer always gives you random copolymer.	283.3953660796517
Just to repeat the cross linking refers to linking more than one enzyme molecule through their functional residues present on their surface.	1194.893508411963
It also undergoes a transition state eab * and then it goes to enzyme and product.	100.78805235832596
The turn over of the enzyme molecule itself in a living cell is quite low.	163.86704900518427
So , basically of , you arrange all the bonds one after one , all the bonds , the length will give you the contour length.	237.32063676483293
As a result now the cis this is coming from same side.	528.5182827761079
So , going to molding and molding is a cyclic transient process and is molding can be used for making complicated three dimensional parts , as i said it could be injection molding , blow molding , thermo forming.	1389.9261294882244
This is nothing but this is the osmotic pressure which we can detect through our measurement and this is the partial molar volume of the solvent and for a very dilute solution which is our working condition.	258.7238231410224
The same scenario is that even a chemical process industry depends on a whole lot of chemical reactions which are catalyzed either spontaneously or with the use of catalyst.	426.6620938956128
The active site consists of the substrate binding site plus catalytic site.	88.79745960913723
The adsorbent whatever we have used that morphology will be available and thereby one can get a much better preparation which can be used in reactor systems.	253.97041515885977
The cell membrane is much more specific and has quiet distinct features compared to an ordinary ultra filtration cell which only functions based on molecular weight.	1284.9884261710565
On the left hand side i have shown the diffusional effects.	20.231773481677397
So , n 0 minus n is the monomers which are reacted.	21.319365109078202
You have continuous stirred tank reactor and the classical feature of a continuous stirred tank reactor is it is a type of a stirred reactor in which you give a continuous supply of substrates in the form of feed and the same volume at the same rate the product stream is taken out while retaining the immobilized enzyme preparation in the reactor stream.	167.43383656841985
If the reaction , if the molecules in all the chains , now tied up in all the chains , if i have say something like this , polymer chains are growing.	172.69666018740241
So you can reduce it.	51.74235141403548
So , is clear , 100 means the number of monomers on average , which is present in a polymer chain before it undergoes termination reaction.	83.02377575847795
When i increase number , if we talk about number fraction , it is the lower monomer , dimmer or trimmer.	567.7434525926269
And we also know that , we also can imagine that , when the monomers add on to form a high molecular rate polymers , the translational and trophy decreases.	116.11854791418293
Once by folding process if they come and become a part of the active site , the amino and carboxylic groups are also important in the catalytic function but again they are also polar in nature.	440.0948510374512
So if the solution is very dilute , then we can write eta s p i is c i eta i.	230.41990243312753
So , that is your weight fraction.	27.627868901919715
So , if q is the total number of polymer solvent contacts , then enthalpy of mixing will be given q multiplied by the interaction energy for each contact.	111.66534064515851
So it does not restrict to but what we are talking of the basic definition of immobilized enzyme that you can do it in that matter.	107.3501448657731
Another important parameter of the reactor design when we defined the parameters is reactor productivity that is pr and is defined as xs0 /.	978.5574887521504
A large number of methods for covalent coupling are based on peptide bond formation.	94.4381061602648
Now , what is the value of e r.	20.751240437257977
The other is the diffusional limitations caused by the boundary layer film , inert film on the boundary as external film diffusion.	409.47089130410427
If f is 3, it will become even narrower.	304.41039980163805
The reaction proceeds without establishing a equilibrium between the cyclic and linear species here.	328.96793754929985
Mg2 + is an absolute requirement.	738.2367519386888
Proteases and lipases or tannase or for that matter n number of other hydrolytic enzymes follow the covalent bond formation.	630.031115783523
It can also give you lot of insight into the biological phenomena , the kind of reactions that the enzymes carry out inside the cell at molecular level , their intercellular concentrations , their physiology , directions and regulation.	572.9046129374773
An isotactic polymer is always formed when it is preferred orientation for coordination is much lower than the other.	489.9809556645496
Now , this is known as flory - huggins equation as you might have known by now.	145.25271773791036
And then we just began with different processes of making polymers , by radical chain polymerization , and we talked about bulk and solutions solution polymerization in last lecture.	308.7302315929382
So , you multiplied by 2 to get the number of moles of functional groups reacted , and n 0 was the monomers were present originally.	288.7309363098902
So , minus t del s will become more positive; which means , at some point , at a very high temperature del z , del z will be the 0, and positive above certain temperature.	758.1222384084368
The strain rate physically , how fast you applying the stress or how fast you straining the polymeric material for example , this is a stress strain curve for poly methyl methacrylate.	359.8418301956689
So , we can write that intrinsic viscosity is proportional to; the proportionality sign is also missing here is v h which is proportional to this term divide by m.	251.35684521640056
But otherwise as a system if you look at this provides you an ideal system because it gives you very large interphase; it gives you a hydrophobic interface which can remain stable in the.	635.7145189535155
And if it is a copolymer what is the composition , what is the , what is the sequence of monomer present in the monomer in the polymer and we know what is the molecular weight of the polymer.	20.244667112679462
So they are affordable.	322.5241526507699
This lacks any significant stabilization mechanism either by resonance or by inductive effect , whereas , a styrene will have stabilization radical generated from styrene will have the stabilization by resonance.	2878.9784854504933
Now , you have to take the polymers towards application side.	54.33547126717812
Sometime one finds that there is a large deviation.	1316.9782819141599
Titanium tetra chloride will exist in different forms and the complexes will be either dominated by water molecules as the ligand in the octahedral complex form.	1938.57388003605
So both the things have to be really tackled so as to be able to apply enzymes on a large perspective like for example glucose oxidase can use large number of electron acceptor other than oxygen which can be then reduced at the expense of glucose.	907.9917697170677
Now , the advantage of this photochemical reactions or photo chemical initiator is that you can do your polymerization reactions locally.	606.9292887111842
Another source of non - ideality could be that the reactor may have some kind of dead zone because of the improper mixing and this dead zone is v . f.	1488.497789289714
You will also appreciate that the use of enzymes particularly for an industrial application are often limited to the sections that are listed here.	468.7523728314373
We talked about in the initial lectures when we introduced the radical polymerization about five six lectures back.	511.42536337592935
So , then end of this module of chain polymerization , let us conclude with just a few basic comparison between the radical and anionic chain polymerization we studied.	665.1426684862834
The neutral substrate and protonated substrate is the reactive form which is acceptable to the enzyme.	453.88139508133645
Now , these are this conformations are eclipse conformations , and these three are conformations , and most specifically this is trans conformation , and these are gauss conformations.	848.5656537123369
But the two important class of factors which i wanted to point out here is one is reaction kinetics and mass transfer characteristics.	710.8813614924877
And this coming from a combination of enthalpy and entropy change due to polymer solvents contacts.	940.1906654450606
They are any units; donot bother about units.	1025.843000871678
So , as a result alpha methyl styrene has much lower del h value compared to the styrene.	109.00058564011252
So , radicals radical initiator is not a basically feasible in terms of in case of ring opening polymerization.	185.11071132782445
Now , am not going in to detain about this method how there how there use to determine the value of tau s , but because this is not the scope of the courses , but if for your knowledge that this are the method are applied to get the value of tau s.	425.9966059438063
Such a situation is a special case of this broad profile in the sense that here the pka value of the two ionisable groups are distinct apart , one at three and another at ten.	301.6788278709981
On the other hand here in the case of adsorption the enzyme is itself a ligand and the matrix or the carrier is the surface on which the ligand adsorbs.	797.516051011484
Typically , amorphous materials are processed melt process at t g plus sum or 80 to 140 degree centigrade temperature.	1109.6270405780836
Similarly , this line is the loci for locus for the spinodal points , spinodal points these are the different points for the different temperature.	359.9767625155758
You just dip in the solution and get the result , output whereas if you have to really set up an auto analyzer it will have a full fledged setup with all tubing and you will have a reaction period and all those things and ultimately you will end up in a very cumbersome system.	876.0433398979109
So , you can now understand that if i plot say percentage conversion with d p degree of polymerization or say molecular weight or molecular weight in case of step growth polymerization , it will only start from a slow so , in a very low conversion you know the high the the polymer chains only will be achieved , you know high molecular polymer chains will be only achieved at very high conversion close to 98 percentage above.	418.7487565997616
So , it is same as if there was no expansion of the coil due to the presence of the solvent.	50.69093362108044
In this case they keep this specify specified geometry of sample like , and this states , this states are very difficult to carry out repeatedly , and the only trained and certified person actually do test , for this a comparing material , or give the rating.	2865.7797212824767
Most of the information on the architecture of the active sites , which are the functional groups that are present on the active sites or the mechanism of the specificity , has resulted from the understanding of the interaction of inhibitor molecules or activator molecules in the enzyme catalyzed reactions.	146.2212691949862
Now , i was talking about , that if you have a larger ring , larger linear molecules , say having 14 or higher number of atoms in the , in the ring , in the linear molecules , then they have so many conformation , this , as the more or the higher is the number of atoms or longer is the chain , you have more number of conformation of that molecule possible.	201.1909193565284
In the preparation of nylon microcapsules , an aqueous solution of the enzyme and hydrophilic monomer like hexamethylene diamine is dissolved in a buffer.	295.3039275562951
If intermolecular chain transfer happen then the p d i goes up further.	190.57773758178436
It can react with monomer.	6.303384209401935
For example when you want to use an immobilized enzyme preparation for any bio - medical application it will interact with the blood stream and any external material in contact with the blood stream will generate a very vigorous immunological response and it has been noted that the non - porous matrices or the non - porous materials are much softer as far as these responses are concerned compared to porous ones.	721.7957368756229
So , you can if you want to increase the polymerization rate you can do it much easier way by increasing the temperature.	55.23521262176772
Another point is the bulk of the analytical applications were the earliest uses of immobilized enzymes.	261.5405709589324
The change in km value can be attributed to diffusional limitations as well as partitioning of substrate.	49.95805952045894
Now , we know different test impact test , tensile test , now we need to find out , what is the relations between the polymer structure and and the properties.	161.77148661792972
And we also know from our original discussion that , we don t require high conversion.	153.00696298526756
Reverse micelle is just like water in oil emulsion where by you have enzyme entrapped.	2596.766324482439
And hence there will be tendency for any of the two stereo regularity formations which will lead to atactic molecule atactic polymer.	1173.3978403429858
And the polymers gets separated in this column and then you can get detect the polymers using detectors concentration detectors like uv , ir or refractive index detector.	2191.191251485189
Chain transfer also can be possible to the other substance , whether it is present as in impurities or you have added deliberately as a chain transfer agent to control the molecular weight.	293.8076636892166
So , n is n a by 2, 1 plus 1 by r minus 2 p.	10.606465078064932
Otherwise , if you do not put a bracket it might gives you a confusion of you know which finally , which structure it is.	1357.4602167869486
So , from this reaction you are getting the , this is .	26.535795618321572
Then another application in food sector has been on lactose free milk.	1003.1586422856437
So , for same temperature and pressure and same solvent , if you mix a polymer having same size , it will give lower entropy of mixing than a polymer which is having a lower size.	122.12787729980309
These are just examples arbitrarily chosen from the literature.	120.81867282773966
The kinetic parameter available from michaelis menten kinetics can give you some insight into this.	488.71526321364047
You know , that is obvious; what is the orientation of the monomer , when it gets complex and inserted , that orientation is determined by the stereo center , whether it will be isotactic or syndiotactic.	455.984290620666
The reaction velocity for such a reaction will be given by v = k3 ( et ) k - 3 [ e ].	270.0488304912475
Remember the expression for the atip.	383.602776464597
We have not considered the behaviour of the reactor performance if the enzyme undergoes inhibition kinetics.	156.23637306648462
For example , i have initiator like this.	19.604420200959567
Now , if you look at this slide , this is the topic these are the topics we thought of covering in this amorphous and crystalline state.	119.21619702660855
The other advantage is that the disadvantage of the cross linked enzymes , that is the gelatinous morphology will also be removed because the cross linked preparation in the presence of the adsorbent will have the morphology of the carrier particle.	324.9306374429508
Now if the concentration is little higher , we talked about this is only applicable for eta r is less than equals to two if the concentration is higher , then this expression can be expressed like the real expression where plus other constant and so on if eta c is less than much less than one , you can ignore this terms higher term c square onwards terms , then you land up getting the huggins expression again.	479.82682787354446
The same expressions when you talk of packed bed of chips that means very thin films of very fine thickness let us say of the thickness l.	1301.780495660419
Now , when this has to further take part in polymerization it has to approach this monomer.	251.29415762508592
So , let me write it again.	27.21981947353493
Because this is inbuilt to polymer chain you cannot compact , then your bond angle has to be lower , and rotational restriction has to be lower , so you cannot bring down the expansion factor , so it starts precipitating , with expansion factor of close to .	542.9367850654069
And after that we take out that material , and measure the mechanically property change , whether it survived or not.	293.73290797158404
The understanding in the mind of the scientists that there are some biological catalysts which catalyze a number of reactions particularly the key reaction which people have understood then thanks to the availability of alcoholic beverages that the yeast possesses some enzyme which hydrolysis sucrose into glucose.	2538.1222558505838
So far we have seen the influence of substrate concentration , inhibitor concentration or activator concentration on the rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction and they very strongly influence the catalytic behavior.	90.33431149793039
But at least in two distinct cases where we are handling very high substrate concentrations of the order of say greater than 50 or 60 % weight by volume or in cases where we are carrying out reactions in the non polar medium , water activity also becomes a key parameter for study under enzyme kinetics because then it controls the rate of enzymatic reaction and therefore it must be taken into account.	589.4282868615137
Those are compact with the value which was , before the exposure to the chemicals.	3687.483762505459
Most of the materials that we use , whether they are sulphur drugs or antibiotics , they are inhibitors or activators of certain enzymes.	1047.0999817579197
They will try to expand , now if they try to expand , what will happen they will try to overlap with this chain , if they expand obviously , they will try to occupy the space which is already occupied by this chain.	320.95536090506357
So , how this uv spectroscopy is applied in polymer science , in characterization of polymers basically , it is like the how the uv spectroscopy is applied to in for the small molecules for example , it helps in detection of particular homophobes , which been light absorbing group present in a molecules.	1372.8281514617186
That means concentration of enzyme will reflect the concentration of active sites.	198.65892180081937
If you if you compare between the acrylic acid and say acrylonitrile and acrylic acid.	135.99120034552658
So , in case of polymers , we apply lectures in time , if we get the relaxation time , then we can get the information about polymer dynamics , and we gets information about pressure went off atoms.	417.71786484591973
Therefore a number of other linear plots were thought of and the other linear plots are hanes plot which is nothing else but the modification of original equation.	892.6256354316905
The other group of application sector is analytical applications.	352.95484764177604
Now these are all amaphorous material; polystyrene , poly polymethcalate , and polycarbon bpa polycarbonate , and tgs are , approximate tgs are listed here 100 14.	3165.8915305964665
Most cases this m 1 and m 2 m will have difference in reactivity , and results what happened one of the monomers get incorporated in the growing copolymer , much faster rate compared to the other.	215.6477634739386
So , original.	224.45048545024594
Semi - crystalline polymer means a polymer having both crystalline regions and amorphous regions.	1232.6372901580241
You have to give a lot of force , but once it starts stretching , that means the samples yielded.	640.1314452383291
So , if i take a example of adipic acid , plus ethylene glycol , you get a polymer of this.	40.48989478518234
If you plot the rate of polymerization , which is 1 by t , it will be coming down linearly.	30.80171352767161
If you cool fast , then t g will be higher; if we give more time , the polymer chains to arrange themself and give more time , which means cool slowly , then t g will be lower; which means is that , these curves will look like same , but this temperature glass transition temperature will vary , if we change the cooling rate or incase of reverse direction heating rate.	602.416511927396
If you just have a ether linkage , then flexibility goes up even higher , you get it drop in t m value.	312.9854472350518
So , by writing for a simple , for a simple model , the molecular model , freely jointed chain for no restriction , we now shown that using gaussian distribution function or random coil approach , it can be shown that the , it shows this , it has this relation; which means that coil dimensions will be significantly lesser than the contour length , if you have a molecule of say 10000 units 10000 repeating units.	622.3935568621199
Most of the chemistry of the covalent binding has been developed on the basis of the chemistry available for preparing the matrices for affinity chromatography.	546.4004719529211
So , with increasing in external field , the intensity of absorption always go up , and the sensitivity of the instrument , of the of the measurements goes up.	175.00261789962144
Second is regular solution; entropy of mixing is same as ideal solution but enthalpy of mixing is not .	614.4684850063832
For example , concentration of anionic species is almost like 10 to the power of 5 times higher than m dot in a radical chain polymerization , which makes r p for anionic is much higher than r p for radical and that is why this anionic reactions get over in very short time , even in few seconds.	581.8690711213485
So , this is expected that at low conversion the polydispersity will between 1.5 to .	288.41677477622375
Just remember this point; we will come to the detail turbulent polymerization when the proper time comes.	1497.520584275416
Today we will be talking about the role of effector molecules in the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions.	14.163653405084023
That means when you plot 1 / v0 and 1 / [ s ] you get a straight line relationship with a slope equal to km / k2 [ e0 ] with intercept 1 / vm.	116.39826561063985
That means the enzyme has no role to play here.	67.43020856755415
The active sites must be considered as consisting of two different parts : the binding sites and the functional sites.	386.2855241912305
The other is the substrate is also getting consumed during the reaction.	34.133313959178835
Such profiles are indicative of modification of dissociation constant as a function of substrate binding in the presence of non - competitive inhibitors.	172.7852168973966
For example , reactions between acid chloride and alcohol and if you take out that , if you take out the resulting polymer from the solution , then there is a possibility , that you can get the arrangement of this two monomers other than random.	101.51576309037097
There is a basically , there is a control over the composition in the entire polymer sample is required.	88.89220404576888
Then the brewing industry uses for chill proofing of beer.	3541.697580000589
This eab * is reduced by virtue of the complementary nature of binding of the enzyme molecule to the ab *.	137.53241393184217
The enzyme feed is put in , in the hollow fibers and the main feed substrate is passed through the cell side and because of the semi permeability of the hollow fiber membranes the substrate and the enzyme can come in contact.	730.9018817904753
Now , this cannot react by themselves.	15.197894230153988
Even the stereospecificity was not clearly understood.	731.8743131806783
So , which makes that , this is present in double amount corresponding to this individual , so if you start with a 50 : 50 mixture obviously , if it random it is from a random copolymer , you will get this as a 25 percent , this is 25 percent , and this is 25 percent plus 25 percent 50 percent.	216.68928198252536
The other idealized reactor or which is what we understand as the plug flow is slightly typical in the sense that unlike in the case of a cstr , the concentration of the substrate or the product vary along the length of the reactor.	113.47154573674744
And spectroscopy is a most powerful method , which we can utilize to get this structure analysis done.	364.3256186506148
The first step is basically initiation.	81.77133458569152
And also , the stability of this m n dot or a dot , if it is more stable , then it will be this reaction will be dominating over the original propagation reaction.	89.29897650312321
More exothermic the reaction we are handling , the system can be more effective.	244.73944178671803
No that mechanism can be developed , but it should be in proximity with the electrode.	151.77497419818533
Chemical resistance; obviously , chemical exposure may result in physical degradation , stress cracking , craze , swelling , discoloration , so many things can happen.	4029.6439883065555
So , it will be equals to m w as a value lies between 0.5 to 0.8; m w will be m v , m v would be more than m n and less than m w.	138.4725829666207
So , n 2 number of solute molecules and n 1 number of solvent molecules which are shown in this colors and total n 1 and n 2 is the total number of molecules and they are placed randomly in this cell.	113.55656265104679
If you just compare the two kinds of profiles , this is a sigmoidal profile and this is the hyperbolic profile.	152.56022223153803
The only difference you will notice in that case is that the ph optimum profile will not be a very sharp bell shape but can be broken down into different stages or segments , each of the segment representing the ionization state of that particular segment.	367.72517875886615
They may vary somewhere in between the two and that flow behaviour also might influence the reactor performance.	391.70782908768643
Now , in the step molecular , how the distribution looks.	518.5985550731928
Similarly for k that concentration of a at which the reaction velocity is half that of vm at a saturating concentration of b.	76.09697269788703
When x n is infinity , so p c , p critical , which , that , which conversion the , the conversion at which there is a first time of gel formation or the network formation , we call that as gel point and which gives you by , 2 by f average.	579.6773650921255
Metallocene polymerization can be done in solution in a homogeneous medium.	186.50533188591913
Although deae sephadex is very expensive , considered to be probably one of the most expensive carrier that is tested on all materials , the total life of the carrier which they were able to use is almost five years.	1111.830073703663
If the polymer produced from this molecule is strained , highly strained , then also deluge value comes down.	250.1252400054845
As i know as we know that high monomer gives high reaction rate.	341.93770689011853
Many of the heavy metals like mercury or some of the poisonous gases also have the same action of irreversible inhibition whereby saving the person become difficult.	996.3010737616291
So , p e m 0, so in case of that rearranging , we get p e as root k 1 plus root k or x n bar is 1 by 1 over p e.	556.603921781045
So , these are showing the possibilities of cyclization.	71.70377907595879
So , this at the end of the reaction if remains like this you can add a second monomer and you can block a polymer.	37.03358918358236
So , to include the number of radicals form , the initiator molecules which is given by if it is thermal polymerization is to 5, this is your deficiency factor and the conversion of this.	278.6990614347557
Higher the catalyst density the over all reaction rate can also be very high because the enzyme concentration per unit volume will be much higher compared to a cstr.	97.08146964826193
So , when you make a polyester from this two monomer terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol you get a polymer which is polyester.	20.989748010082675
In the case of pfr the space time required will be much less compared to cstr in the first order regime.	30.45607644454281
So because of the effective concentration fluctuation , the light scattering happens from the polymer of the solute molecules.	216.21372803425186
This we can get.	33.45816758416393
Hello.	22247.403323153263
But the role of ph in the case of enzyme reaction in organic solvents has a different connotation and the connotation is that it has been reported by some workers that enzymes unlike many other small molecular weight chemical compounds possess a memory with respect to certain physical features say for example ph.	574.2897523801391
So , if i repeat this life stages and various transformation step you have a monomer which most often we get from petroleum products and from monomers by doing a step called polymerization we get the polymers in the plant or in a lab either in solution or in bulk or in some cases in emulsion form.	362.6790884535154
Now , if these chains are flexible in the temperature you are working , then they can be stretched and as soon as you remove the stress , they will come back to the original form.	62.534590614673576
You can also have steric effect polar effect.	95.0180675685328
If you consider a - d - glucose the particular enzyme doesnt act or for that matter even if you go to another isomer of glucose say galactose it doesnt act on even galactose , which is not very different , excepting that these hydroxyl and hydrogen atoms are inter changed.	1183.0831486815844
The aggregates will be insoluble and they can be used as immobilized preparation which can be readily separated from the lipid phase.	1072.4206668906027
This k is different than the michaelis menten constant.	31.06232736914198
In the case of strongly substrate inhibited enzymes , if the concentration of substrate at the surface is high then for substrate inhibited reaction , the reaction rate will be low and because of the pore diffusional parameter the substrate concentration across the pores is reducing.	172.01460203031343
And at some points they converge so this point this is critical points is given by critical points is given by convergence of the points of common tangency and inflection points.	1000.968620014021
So , it will be it will have effect against solution.	54.68107552144021
Minimum information should be provided so that anybody who wants to reproduce the method can use it for further work.	2923.946483244404
But if you have a cationic initiator for this case , and if you have a.	9.70047059026524
M dot is the concentration of all the radical species present , all the summation of the concentration , all the propagating radical and this is k t m dot square , or i can write simply it is.	72.3283669373366
Annealing; annealing is nothing but heating a polymer at particular temperature.	1217.112002768398
So , their reactivity ratios are almost close to .	52.307690131712164
So , monomers are copolymerize with styrene and you get the experimental values of r 1 r 2 and from known values of styrene having q is 1 and e is minus 0.8, you can get the unknown values for the second monomer.	219.01068051461073
And what happened when these things are mixed , ti cl 4 and triethyl aluminum.	903.4539570138496
So , eta s p i is the intrinsic viscosity of n i moles of molecules having molecular weight m i present at a concentration of c i per unit volume.	140.52700693587886
But in this ionic chain polymerization we , this is the faster reaction step where this is the slower and rate determining step.	340.42087365048246
So , it will be a negative quantity.	45.2892449758017
We know from our discussion from last few lectures that , if you want to increase the polymerization rate either by increasing the temperature , or by increasing the initiator concentration what happen , polymerization rate goes up , but simultaneously the molecular weight comes down.	39.001686047449496
Only when the substrate is bound to the enzyme it can bind to the enzyme substrate complex and after binding of the inhibitor the es complex becomes an inactive complex and the inhibitor does not bind to the free enzyme.	35.263671052640305
The second issue is regeneration of the coenzyme.	55.99850565599245
So , after this nomenclature we will move to one of the important aspect of polymer molecular weight.	160.32454778982438
Now , if i plot this , how does it look.	17.06882927765269
So , if i compare acrylonitrile and say methyl phenyl ketone , then they will have almost ideal polymerization copolymerization.	386.2314594602515
The ratio of reactivity ratios are r 1 if this is m 1, this is m .	124.65561531630843
So , we will start next lecture from this , this page and talk about more on the values of del h and del s and how a monomer structure actually determine or influence the value of del h , and which in turn determine the thermodynamic feasibility of polymerization of a monomer.	110.98583288127712
That means it will be something like this , where the slope is kappm / vm.	24.913563090730726
Now in this slide it is shown as one of the 2d version of the 3d.	364.31838481782825
Normally we understand that enzymes are operable in aqueous medium and the basic reason is that a large number of non - covalent interactions that we are familiar with enzyme structure are through interaction of the enzyme protein with the water molecule and water is a requisite specie in the case of maintenance of a confirmation of an enzyme molecule and to carry out the chemical or bio chemical reactions.	377.87468750580035
So , this is not a hence this is not a true second order thermodynamic transition , but for a particular heating rate the phase transition between the glassy state , and the rubbery state is resembles with a second order thermodynamics transition.	368.97663208996505
An alternative situation in enzyme reactor is that sometimes we tend to develop reactor designs for various reasons because of the requirement of the reactions.	953.9618688910632
In most cases , it will be alternating , but there will be some cases , there will be two m 1 and three m 1 sitting next to next each other.	148.58225035012183
First thing comes into mind is a polymer and more often not a polymer becomes very often the material of choice for new applications.	814.92915528262
Second; obviously , the amount of scattering will depend upon , the size and the shape of the scatterer; the more the size , in comparison to the white plane length of the light being scattered , the higher would be the amount of scattering.	298.89963475933484
You can express in that term.	223.26152120312858
We must ensure that we are measuring our enzyme concentration in the linear range that means at low enzyme concentration level.	278.7195106610647
If you consider substrate concentration in millimolar quantity and the reaction velocity in some arbitrary units , you see at 5, 1 / s will be 0.2, 10 - 0.1, 15 - 0.66, 20 - 0.05, 30 - 0.033, 40 - . 025 and so on.	1347.300364178895
So , the cost for the particular application must be kept in someone , in mind of the , in mind of the manufactural.	964.0441374126597
Mainly these two behaviors , approximation or orientation effects are the major contributing factors in all catalytic reactions catalyzed by enzyme molecules.	2478.650055453451
Now , these are also application of polymers which it does not come to your mind immediately , but like this there are hundreds of very high end applications of polymers.	278.4097083574101
Total number of empty cells is n 0 minus x i divided by total number of cells.	96.661586931619
This is the active site which is analogues to the lock.	10.712140659475565
Therefore rate of mass transfer is rm = klam . ( sb - ss ) in the case of a non - porous particle the issue is to develop an expression which gives you the substrate concentration at the surface because the reaction will take place at the surface of substrate concentration.	73.2525396534588
So , bigger in size and if the polymer solvent interaction is lower compared to the main interaction of polymer - polymer and solvent - solvent , then it will try to contract and avoid the solvent molecules.	257.33462397883744
When i say physico - chemical properties the most important properties probably for which enzymes are considered as poor candidates are their stability.	790.6239220901379
So , for a fixed theta we can extrapolate to c 1 equals to 0, c is equal to zeros; similarly , we can extrapolate theta 2 c is equal to 0 and theta 3 is equal to 0, and also this value to theta is equal to 0; c 2 to theta is equal to 0 and this two again theta is equal to .	398.83618781732144
In fact in many cases in the chemical analysis detection of d - amino acid is difficult because it gets destroyed.	202.16702969152584
So , at room temperature , at the main temperature with pvc becomes flexible and the applications of flexible pvc are lot.	1048.4738947600679
So , this is another way we can cyclic and form and this is the process is called backbiting , from the end of the polymer chain to the back bone of the existing polymer chain.	141.16747411556796
So , these ionic centers are destroyed with reaction of this hydroxyl , hydroxy molecules , h 2 o or alcohol.	235.56513327566532
So , we can write this n 1 ln phi 1 plus n 2 ln phi 2 or we can write this.	88.78737340577916
So , ideally you should have m v value for all these samples which you do not have because that is what you are determining.	500.13438632708437
But still most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions are inhibited naturally by either substrate or the product; the product is a very common case.	213.8728901995757
Just talk about rheology and entanglement of polymer molecules.	270.35053432104144
Then only , they can suck out that molecule from the system , but if it is forming inside the reaction in first , it has to defuse out to the surface of your reaction medium and then only , it will go up of the system.	318.84769691330547
This compounds specifically is that it is water soluble , water soluble at p h greater than 7, so you can use this azo compounds at acquits medium as well.	608.9738644209042
Now let us continue the discussion we are having in last lecture.	6.668913134827402
In principle the enzyme is bound to ion selective electrode that will detect the presence of a substrate or product.	420.04808232241885
So these things will be offering during your copolymerization reaction.	411.0806801811062
So there is a sequence of binding.	24.509941887163983
We have seen the second type , where this product is equals to 0 and which gives towards alternate copolymerization.	253.37204306478154
They produce completely isotactic polymers except few cases; where there are few exceptions like vanadium chloride plus trialkyl compound , which gives syndiotactic.	2326.5161043998796
On the other hand , in the case of glucose it is glucose to gluconic acid plus hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidizing agent and it oxidizes the dpi to coloured product which is blue in color and is measured.	1346.3380065111985
That means the intermolecular cross linking between the enzyme molecules should not involve the catalytic functional group that is required on the enzyme molecule.	136.55410472759797
Now we can also write , that the light , the flux of the transmitted light , which went out and deviated , would be phi , is the flask of the incoming light minus , the phi d 2 reflection , from surface , minus phi scattering in all direction.	849.8115161465045
Now , one defined the term solubility parameter which is basically square root of cohesive energy density.	322.23216325996026
And , we talked about different types of initiator , which can be used or which can be utilized; for example , we talked about thermal initiator , where by applying heat we can dissociate homiletically a set of molecules or different types of molecules , for example , aibn and benzyl peroxide , which we can use for radical chain polymerization as initiator.	174.61282970594942
Just briefly discussed the weathering of polymer , with lot polymer are used in outdoor applications.	951.3955375390443
How many.	13.027262570673523
Haldane was one of the scientist who did all of his work in india.	2215.798664996529
As per the normal reaction of succinic dehydrogenase two carboxylic group of substrate molecule are required to be bound to the enzyme active sites and at low concentration of substrate this can very well happen.	273.80833646459104
So , in this case , the molecular weight depends upon the chain transfer reagent and the chain transfer constant is much higher compared , much higher , so that all the raft agent is taking part in the chain transfer reagent and also because the concentration of the initial raft agent is much higher than original initiator radical , we can simply write the average degrees of polymerization , end of the polymerization is.	103.79853611874431
So , there is no polymer no monomer is converting in to polymer once this benzoquinone is over then the polymerization reaction start normally.	2036.9812988893918
That is for cstr or for a stirred batch reactor the magnitude of epsilon is one.	161.28414071122066
So , these are typical anionic surfactant used in this emulsion polymerization process , and typical concentration of are the ratio of water is to monomer is taken as say about 70 30 to 60 40 by weight.	1136.5915466833874
So , polycarbonate will obviously become soluble in chloroform , it is 19.5 and 19.19, 19..	6714.43108850256
If you start polymerization acrylonitrile in water , poly acrylonitrile is not solvable in water , so its precipitated out you get acrylonitrile powder or granular.	821.288053341845
Then the third thing was that he introduced another concept.	385.4392690557655
Prime is added just to indicate that we are reporting an immobilized preparation , just as a convention.	3526.1730805324414
And also e d for thermal was higher than e d for redox than e d or a photochemical process.	1015.9210518732023
Mainly because , the fact that , till now we have understand or we have gain the knowledge of polymer resins , you know how to synthesis them , how to characterize them.	976.5845629883883
Anylate is the chemical species which is to be monitored in the sample.	72.4712175572865
So , ideal theoretical polydispersity index should be two but if we find some time , that even in spite of getting large molecular weight , our polydispersity index is lower.	578.6364716239012
And how we can determine the number of residual initiator residues per chain and how that is related to the number of degrees of polymerization.	90.25954390446825
Now , that did not solve the entire problem.	482.9376625203107
So , here , what we are showing here that , here at aromatic teton , which on photo radiation it absorb photons and go to a higher excited state which by itself it can break or dissociate homiletically forming radicals.	1009.1658347090621
Just to provide a support it is inserted between dialysis tubes which is permeable to small molecular weight compound like glucose freely and which is put on this teflon membrane which is already present in the dissolved oxygen electrode.	1045.8652905441606
So , most of the reactions in industrial setup are carried out in external catalyzed reaction.	129.7624340774596
This will be a function of the particle shape and size.	25.28820028201238
On the other hand in the case of pfr the corresponding relationship is kd . t = ln s0x0 - km ln ( 1 - x0 ) / s0x0 - km ln ( 1 - xt ) here also you can consider the effect of the operational stability on the reactor performance.	31.611492050053283
So , if you decrease temperature , rate of reaction goes down.	31.429316979244373
Co - polymers occur without changing the composition in the feed ratio.	330.1385153681057
And you have non equilibrium micro structure , co existing the amorphous and the crystalline region.	596.6617548181771
So , it has a positive value compared to m m a.	25.336365819351524
It is basically , we know this; the slide glass is hard rigid material , which have only a short - range vibrational and rotational motion of the atoms which is a hard , rigid and the brittle material.	615.4279512209703
One of the most significant tools which have made many of the enzyme reactions commercially viable is immobilization of enzymes.	273.7146803437719
So , you do not have an effective polymerization happening.	57.21897769354176
So , with polymerization the double bond will be absent , so with progress , with falling intensity of the double bonds and protons in that c c double bond , we can follow the polymerization process.	671.7849395432087
Either the enzymes are supported on membrane or they are supported on certain particulate matters and therefore the methods based on adsorption are usually very analogues similar to those that are found in the living system.	376.98754063052377
This is the fraction of stream edt; this is the concentration of substrate remaining in the element.	85.40881946408987
The adsorption process for a particular enzyme and for a particular carrier can be analyzed quantitatively.	423.5980294963857
Lysine has been most commonly used for covalent binding , next followed by cystein followed by tyrosine , histidine , aspartic acid , glutamic acid , tryptophane , serine , threonine and methionine as the rare case.	1321.7814863150563
So , which means that between this point and this point between this point and this point any composition , which immediately phase separate and come to this two points.	54.42089224904094
Sub classes refer to the type of substrate or the type of the product that is produced by those enzymes.	790.1563084478789
At a value of ph which is lesser than pk value of the ionisable residue , the vm remains constant and at its original value.	952.8600390956663
The inflection point is the boundary between the mate stable and the unstable compositions and this gives why this expression.	1662.9600930324045
It is advantageous in the sense that specificity will bring in lack of any byproducts because it will not act on any of the other substrate molecule which are present as additions or contaminant in the stream and you will only be reacting the desired substrate and converting it to product.	1656.72172726218
Another example of a competitive inhibitor is sulfanilamide which is a sulpha drug.	106.31008143908055
And then we will start the discussion on gel permeation chromatography on the later part of this lecture.	21.601881438493532
And if you have atactic polypropylene , then again there will not be any regularity in the chain.	139.16556282597028
Suppose this e would have been a chemical catalyst this binding would not have been feasible because there would have been no complimentary catalytic function.	1620.7561291232794
These conformations are the result of the nature of the amino acids , the side chains of the amino acids , the principle functional group.	44.16679275630195
So the reaction rate can be very slow.	9.181972352581923
Such a situation can be considered something away from the ideality , a kind of mixed type of inhibition.	190.42973562299576
Now this will not be stabilized by this substituent s.	20.162534809947168
What we are going to do is find out first how many different ways we can arrange the polymer segments.	65.02619038210729
We never attempt to get the reaction converted to completion because then the residence time , space time required in the reactor will be very , very high because it is a reversible reaction.	206.24711269650126
Now , the molecule , relation between molecular weight and degrees of polymers; molecular weight , m n , is degrees of polymer multiplied by the molecular rate of the structure units.	258.86629454575944
But not everything is good in this case , also there are disadvantages as well , now because you are planning to take out the polymerization at the end of the reaction in the form of beads , and take it to the application , the polymerization must complete.	258.83377070191654
Now , if the structure of this is such that here if this equilibrium is shifted mostly towards right hand side , then what happened is this radical stays or spend most of its time in a dormant form.	243.68411676782824
Again like the various classification ways , you know various ways of classifying polymer molecules this nomenclatural so also not very unambiguous.	1612.0243818515216
The second effect of ph is on ph stability; the same thing , the same partitioning effect.	172.66032015682526
Then the immobilization will be identical.	76.11857869699891
Some cases where you need polystyrene beads and if you are giving the suspension polymers , some cross linker vinyl benzene type compound , then you can actually make cross linked bib , polystyrene bead by suspension polymerization.	660.0142158099871
So , they are basically achiral in nature.	51.829321711212614
Similarly ey will also have only one pattern k1a k2b and k.	219.201770421091
If f is 1, then it will be , if the distribution is like this , if the distribution is like this , for f is 1, if i increase f , it will be narrower.	202.61489687962992
Each polymer has x segment.	83.59782867887753
Some other large companies , large polymer manufacturing companies , they just mix all this ingredients and extrude the polymer and make granules and sell those granules in big bags.	6739.678150982773
It will form a triangle and e to es , es to et and then et to e.	903.0605753749408
This is average of the residues of the monomer; the monomer minus the condensed , in this case h 2 o.	218.15080892012918
Now , when they form cyclic , when this form cyclic , it is always forming a ring and the size of the ring determine whether it will form in thermodynamically , it will form the formation or not.	483.69188607322076
Very sharp change in substrate concentration can bring in the regulation.	254.1052736382132
So , energy of mixing should be 0 and as you have seen that volume of mixing is also .	434.4823457143198
Pr is reactor productivity and cr is the reactor capacity.	1845.937048376666
And when these two becomes equal , the polymer chain dimension is become same as the unperturbed dimension , and you have equal that solvent as a theta solvent , which basically nullified these two effects.	421.19960470159907
So , r t comes around similarly r p m m dot m dot value typically is between 10 to the power minus 9 to the 10 to the power minus 7 hole square liter , k p is 10 to the power 2 10 to the power 4 liter mole inverse second inverse so r p value is r p value is minus 4 by minus 6 mole detain inverse.	870.7066193241185
Nature of copolymer; that is able to we will be able to find out using nmr spectra for a homopolymer , we can get idea about the tacticity , and also if we apply some chemical reaction or if we can find out the end group; we can get information about the end group present in the polymer.	151.48009636266897
To illustrate my point i think i like to make you familiar with one of the experimental data which was reported.	140.3370631052203
Now , this can also react with , or photo sensitize another molecule; for example , if i have , from here , if i have another molecules , and if ar is ph.	138.19628544157425
Logically the carrier should also be non - toxic to the enzymatic reaction and this should not act as an inhibitor or some kind of an irreversible inhibitor to the enzyme catalyzed reaction.	424.3694501172803
And one thing , it can be noted , not only for this anti oxidant , for all other additives as well that , it is not always a , that all this additives will work for a particular polymer or all polymers.	434.8004894183596
Here q is the concentration of the enzyme protein on to the solid matrix and q0 is the maximum capacity of the matrix.	161.70409099951922
There will be no effect on thermal as a partitioning effect.	93.3721867816445
And sometimes the catalyst , which you are using in the reaction that might be one source , which might be catalyzing the side reactions as well.	70.8936219322136
Basically , polymer does not does not fair well in those applications so , metal is the choice of material in those applications.	1063.7405768556714
But so far not many synthetic enzymes are available which can carry out diverse function as the normal natural catalyst do.	1968.0480470803604
And as the viscosity goes up you cannot start the reaction medium very effectively and if you cannot start you cannot dissipate the heat generated due to exothermic polymerization.	518.6284154229916
They also have produced commercially and find several applications and some other monomers which are also used or polymerized by radical chain.	484.01450512995496
You have lot of enzyme molecules on the surface but on the interior it is very , very rarely distributed and the loading is not uniform.	272.30081567506375
So , another dimension we can have , it is like end to end distance say , if this is one end and this is another end , where we have r , we call end to end distance.	188.6720165805173
And those are purchased by the final or original equipment manufacturer , they just take those granules and do the molding at there there into make the final product.	911.9932178390848
Now there is a third case , where r 1 and r 2 not equal to zero or not equals to .	61.11482315206061
In fact it has almost opposite behavior.	142.50313913853057
Now , that point , so net , so net reaction , net polymerization reaction , which is r p net , how it will act , it will look like.	224.15372326977024
This s m is the combinatorial entropy for the mixture of n 1 solvent molecules and n 2 polymer molecules.	34.66959989253446
But the enzyme active site is not a rigid conformation.	28.181854380878455
On the other hand the disadvantage is from industrial point of view.	23.27871588268911
So , r p , rate of polymerization , polymerization , we have deduced earlier , m n dot , which will now become m r i by k t; now , let us write 2 here; let us follow this convention.	225.98383524285683
The next important interaction , non - covalent interaction is electrostatic force.	330.96723078941096
In this case , part of the radicals which were generated by homiletic cleavage of aibn , they are getting destroyed; in the sense , they are becoming inefficient , inefficient or dead , non radical species by reacting with themselves.	539.6885679485896
On the other hand in the case of a packed bed reactor a significant fraction of the volume of the reactor is occupied by the packed bed and the volume occupied by the fluid or the feed substrate is only the wide volume of the reactor and therefore the volume occupied by the feed in the reactor is considered as the actual reactor volume.	76.02124379645069
So , you can justify the values for methyl methacrylate , which is again a electron accepting monomer.	36.621120831269174
How do you define.	74.16589531956156
So , if basically if you know the solvents and the value of polycarbonate you can predict , you can estimate the whatever , whatever you want to know which application.	494.30716514288366
For example , these are additives , trap this radical , form a radical by themselves , which can rearrange , and react with the other radicals , and form non radical species.	192.50963828085676
All of you know probably with your background in the biochemical metabolism that with each metabolic path way you have certain regulatory enzymes which behave in allosteric manner.	2085.4155260286866
In some cases if the kinetics is much simpler one can very easily approximate it to first order or zero order or even michaelis menten; the life if simpler.	573.9941451967552
If you differentiate it , you find out the rate with respect to the temperature.	110.92383151798013
In case of kramer that constant is negative we just saw.	610.7410529944146
Now , in this case , the linear and cyclic molecules , they are , during the entire reaction they are in equilibrium , whereas in kinetic control process they are not in equilibrium.	82.23487108346907
So , we can write del h m is chi n 1 phi 2 into k t.	185.70620941818171
The other desirable feature of the cstr is that it can be used wherever ph control is required because it provides you an open configuration in which the ph monitoring and control both can be exercised which is very difficult in the case of a plug flow reactor.	372.6304230146424
In next page , another strategy is to take chains topper.	905.3439459736277
So , it is always advisable , it is always advisable , that to minimize the cyclization , we always use the maximum possible concentration of the monomers and the base can , we can do if you do a bulk polymerization , that means , which we are doing the reaction with the monomers and , and the catalyst , if required.	51.75736583661796
In the case of gradient , but here that means there is some conformational change also occurring.	89.89369492356141
You can utilize those double bound , and make this copolymers of polystyrene and acrylonitrile , these are the copolymers of polystyrene and acylonitrile p s co a n , this is polystyrene co acylonitrile.	1072.6929820651112
The dialysate removes the metabolites , urea in this case and the urea level in the blood is brought down , then the conventional way.	887.7565712813258
So , what you do initially , you initiate is dissolved in the monomer and then preheated dispersing minimum added.	427.24915314364256
That means free energy of binding on either site is same and it does not matter to which site the substrate molecule binds first or second; it makes no different.	898.8247312732185
Now , this lecture and probably , next one or two lectures is not directly related to chemistry for say but , as a polymer chemist , if we if you are hired in a company then , you must know the polymer properties.	261.9635773275807
Now , in this case , these reactions are reversible , and you have a associated equilibrium constant with this reaction.	111.40435034836469
Relative in the sense that hundred percent retention of catalytic activity at the end of any processing step is not feasible.	642.8517137555409
So at any given equilibrium the concentration of the eab * that is the product of this binding is much , much higher than as if enzyme does not take part.	192.0369758382408
These data vs , ks , kp and vp will be determined experimentally on the basis of initial reaction rates and not as a general reaction.	942.0227661837978
This enzyme particularly will be able to act upon a large variety of hexose as a substrate and it can phosphorylate.	329.823831599877
So , you make a plot where you put these in y axis this one and put these in x axis.	539.4580098482535
So basically if you talk about different radical mechanism; for example if you talk about , radical initiation by thermal initiation , or a photochemical initiation , or say redox reaction in initiation.	540.4389796136749
Removal of water molecule from lactic acid is reverse of what fumarase does and this reaction is of immense value and if it can be carried out it can serve a great purpose.	2058.1384003871335
We call it fluidized bed; fluidized bed immobilization reactor.	535.788974208146
The enzymes themselves posses a large number of functional groups which can be made to react to each other , thereby aggregating the molecules and making them insoluble in water.	326.35969559622544
And can , this chain can get terminated and you can form , this can now reinitiate the polymers by which it can form branches.	177.92684110876874
But if you do not know; somebody has done it before means for unknown sample , the unknown sample this k and a are not listed.	370.8973022509327
If you recall we discussed substrate inhibition kinetics in which the excess of substrate causes binding of two substrate molecules to the enzyme molecule and which becomes a dead end complex.	250.2718339671612
And this is the temperature on set of large scale molecular motions.	521.3256034793428
The substitution could be aldehyde group , or a say ketone , or a acid , or ester , or amine , amide , like this , so it could be any of this groups.	597.0105910056083
Enzyme being a protein or rather a foreign protein to the body , the body is equipped with antibodies to generate immunological reactions and they can also be problematic and infact the administration of any enzyme for therapeutic application must overcome these problems.	4495.826757421386
So , if we have higher magnetic field , there will be more number of molecules or nuclei in the lower state , then higher state , so when you have a nuclear magnetic radiation coming , the more number of nuclei can move to the higher higher state causing absorption.	403.34749113739645
The d - acyl amino acid is then separated and is taken to a separate tank for racemization where ph is changed and racemization occurs and this mixture is again fed back to this tank as a racemic mixture and the whole process produces almost hundred percent conversion of dl to l - amino acids.	913.3622344066503
If you look at the performance of a plug flow reactor you ultimately arrive at or transfer the s0 to here so tau is equal to s0.dx / - v.	271.3421673431701
Ded2s / dx2 v = 0 v is the apparent rate of reaction that means under apparent kinetic parameters in the case of immobilized enzyme and de is the effective diffusivity.	96.24767020943239
There are many other experimental electrodes which have been made and reported in the literature.	126.01272837522899
So , actually thus the strain , and the stress , or the state actually changes , because the original dimension changes.	347.4634861757022
Now , let us talk about first the bimetallic mechanism.	13.916483868435696
So , if we if kinetic chain length goes up , which means number average degrees of polymerization will go up , hence the molecular weight will also will go up.	66.45206823780886
The suitability of enzyme thermister depends on the enthalpy changes associated with the biochemical reaction.	505.5548113743476
So hence lot of monomers can be utilized or , can be make utilized to copolymer by radical mechanism.	1911.391130583515
So , if it is a polyester , you have to name as a polyester like polyethylene terephthalate , if it is a amide you have to name as a amide.	165.07273954417494
So , basically in feasible you inject the polymer samples in a column which is consist of highly cross linked gel beads; the beads are typically having diameter of 5 microns to 10 microns and they have definite pore size which can start from say for 10 to the power 100 armstrong or 50 armstrong to 10 to the power 5 armstrong.	1053.6282911560447
So , we can analyze the amount of dyes present , we can also analyze specialized additives which are , where the additives are uv visible active.	744.8720086885056
Now , what happened in case of polymer.	6.6762789296804055
So , they are also used by the monomers which are also polymerized by radical polymerization.	56.80220643863846
So , crystalline polymers are much more chemically resistant then , amorphous polymers.	205.48045446882884
Then another process is for malic acid from fumaric acid.	637.8226263161625
Let us move to the next topic; this is the molecular mass spectroscopy of polymers.	57.22058678157248
So , if you have a multi worded monomer , multi worded then you must put a bracket before prefixing the term poly.	224.85750867371138
This alternate configuration of the carbons symmetric centers and in this case it will be arbitrarily atactic would bem say , ddl dlld something like that whatever you want.	1784.2858845006317
So , this is the backbone.	10.47214897801955
Here even in case of tau also we can multiply by voidage if you want to consider a broader picture of a packed bed reactor because this v , reactor volume is not the packed bed volume it is the volume of the fluid in the reactor.	434.65585002925724
Now if all these configuration of these tertiary carbon atoms are same , then we call this is an isotactic polymerization if this is all same.	375.17738902778507
The second question that might emerge in your mind is why do we study enzyme kinetics.	3039.7409179610745
Now , you can do yourself for an external catalyst reaction.	203.13473148718336
If you can use these two equations and substitute arbitrary values for fractional conversion at a given substrate concentration the performance of cstr works out to be far superior compared to a plug flow reactor because the concentration of substrate at any given time physically is much lower than in the case of pfr which for bulk part , more than half of the part , substrate concentration is very high only in the upper half.	392.3763937880361
You will need lot of data available to you before you can apply them but once the data are available one can easily compute and predict many of the behavior which otherwise would have taken a very long time.	2141.8143112243197
If you take for example ethanol oxidization by alcohol dehydrogenase , forming acetaldehyde plus nadh plus h.	1542.7314329339563
If you look at some general principles of covalent coupling we can probably consider all covalent bond forming immobilized enzyme preparations on the basis of three classes of methods.	966.643829220543
This is k p and this is k dp , depropagation reaction.	70.15698154335149
Those situations may not really exist in a living cell.	368.6214127412042
So you can write the rest of the things from the two expressions , we got in the last one.	71.65456381740863
In laboratory experimentation , take a simple stirred vessel in which you take a beaker.	812.5107984130334
One is that there is a rate of diffusion; the substrate will take some time to reach to the different sites of the enzyme present in the pores.	73.82980857612355
So , if the free volume is higher , which means they are the region , the free regions where the gas can diffused through , which means the diffusivity will be higher.	143.96754050564482
By plotting the lineweaver burk plot for immobilized enzyme preparation one can also identify the extent of diffusional limitations because then the kappm drastically changes.	1038.9398629907841
The rate or conversion goes up to a certain one point , where all the micelle are all the the inactive micelles they are broken down realizing all the surfactant.	638.8448560271534
So , one more radical it is coming out capturing a monomer , increasing the chain length , going into the equilibrium.	214.30576812090183
So , that the protein coming proteins is prevented from absorbing on the surface theoritically and one of the examples of the polymers used for surface polyurethanes , polyethylene glycol , very often.	1069.746591773763
So , you do not get best of the two polymers , which are mixed for making the blends so , it is always preferred to make blends , which are partially miscible or comfortable we say , we use the term comfortable , where the individual phases of those polymers are maintain.	581.4537921728157
Typical examples of some of the activators are for example in the case of alpha amylase , calcium ions act as activators which is known to stabilize the enzyme substrate complex.	261.92798462838806
Now you can imagine placing , let us take consider propylene oxide as shown.	947.126357334
So , almost every applications of poly vinyl alcohol , one need to add degrees , stabilize metal oxide , fatty acids salt to basically minimize the hcl production.	2714.8837495515063
And t g is minus 80, whereas putting rigid group in the backbone makes the polymer very stiff , which keeps the t g very high.	358.7961150684325
Now , at the very beginning , you should remember that there has not been or still there is no single method for polymer classifications , which is generally accepted , but i will do , i will list all the various ways of classifying polymers.	345.2545049897475
So , if we want to list or rank between different monomers , the rank of the reactivity would be something like this it is vinyl chloride higher than vinyl acetate , acrylo nitrile methyl acrylate , methyl methacrylate styrene and so on.	645.9590785896997
Bacterial contamination is another very often faced problem in the case of enzyme reactor particularly if you are handling say for example a good nutritive substrate.	968.7578755568163
The slope remains unaltered but the intercept is increased.	344.2781720641285
Although they are based on hard core mathematics matrix algebra he generalized certain rules so that by observation of the reaction mechanism as long as you can write a reaction mechanism one can arrive at a rate expression in a simplistic way.	206.71091702015983
There are basic intrinsic mechanisms and the confirmation of the chemical nature of enzymes is the responsible factor for providing the catalytic efficiency.	224.35027206957247
So , i can write this q , instead of phi 1 x n 2 phi 1 x n 2, i can write z minus 2 n 1 phi .	143.84828517908767
Either you increase the thickness of the particle or increase the enzyme loading.	45.284334147022335
For a perfect total recycled reactor to be considered as a batch reactor operation the requirement should be that the total recycled time must be very small or negligible compared to the total batch cycle; that is the recycling has to be very fast.	289.84819005831173
Then the cross linking is carried out , so that you get a very stable immobilized enzyme preparation which also has the morphology of a particulate matter.	101.12043573626651
If it is carbocation , then also it is s p .	79.46409638480115
So , if you from this chart , we can this is a this is a statistical way of presenting the expected value of mole fraction of the type of linkages in the copolymer , with the mole fraction like in this case , if we have a 50 : 50 composition of a and b , so our composition was mole percent 0..	371.1217618968894
If you want to find out these , you have to know all these rate constant - k p 1, k p 2, k p n , k p 3, k p 4, and all this things; that is practically impossible.	251.96131611377268
So , thermoset polymers are molded using compression molding basically , as you know that , thermo thermoset polymers cannot be flown at higher temperature , they are material.	668.8802638176193
Another method is biuret method which is based on the reduction with alkaline copper sulphate solution which contains sodium potassium tartrate and the cupric ions form a co - ordination complex with the amino groups or the - nh group present in the peptide bond.	279.56386951767803
The use of immobilization enzymes will lead to a heterogeneous catalysis.	43.073396410798885
So , if i want to compare between the chain and step growth polymerization , percentage conversion verses molecular weight.	35.71921692510446
Similarly , m w weight average molecular weight can be obtained from the formula.	125.65587687409374
This is a chain end; this is not the polymer , this is a chain end.	31.985075851643458
And prevent them sterically to collide each other , and aqueous and make larger particles , and this dispersions are typically water soluble polymers like polyethylene , polyvinyl alcohols or polyaniline pyrrolidone and so on.	408.18597505038105
Now , if the stiffness goes up , if you make more stiff , the coiling , the flexibility comes down , coiling will not be possible.	193.63606770443567
For liquids or for solvents we can experimentally determine the molar enthalpy of vaporization and the molar volume.	366.02947026096103
Some of the reagents are soluble in aqueous medium , some are insoluble in aqueous medium and you require a non - aqueous or a more non - polar medium.	114.61417228534349
You will notice that the apparent michaelis menten constant will depend upon the concentration of the other substrate also and this dissociation does not depend upon the other substrate.	96.5592621612445
We talked about , that this monomers like this ether , which have electron donating group like there oxygen , which can be lone pair , can be donated if it is a cationic centre here.	384.9494241162432
So , the types of monomers we there is a there is a different structure where basically these are the types of monomer , you can do a re - opening polymerization.	113.65951728475251
Clear ? now , we have to find out this.	249.0670252206303
What happens in cases of chain copolymerization.	179.84950461967603
The point may let us say go something like this.	431.4123205616267
These multiplying cells or living cells are needed in those cases where the process requires a full metabolic path way which means a series of enzyme reactions which are interlinked for co - factor regeneration or for some other metabolite i mean uptake and production.	1130.3616613857246
It basically try to mimic the applicable a actual application , when the polymers are , actually used in a application , what you want you want the polymers in case of a emergency , what do you want.	344.2392975825815
Let us terribly part of light , which will gets transmitted.	823.4145894671575
If for example , if the monomer is electron donor it will have more tendency to react with a solvent which is electron acceptor , whereas if the monomer is a electron acceptor it will have a tendency to react with electron donating solvent , for let us compare between two monomer and two solvent and see whether , we can justify or we can have this verified from the experimental data.	179.15579929487623
So , this calibration if it is done for linear polymer we cannot use that for other shaped polymer like branched polymer which will have different shape.	319.99336574141967
As a result , m w by m n goes up.	9.661318643203373
Now , you can see that this del h more or less same.	38.86206405104029
Now , quickly go through advantage of maldi tof , it is small amount of sample is required; very sub milligram sample is required and the analysis happens fast within very few minutes compared to the other techniques; it is very efficient.	2611.486897667702
And similarly so here also it will react with b a b a , something like that.	233.72101266644714
This is a same configuration; if you have same configuration from all the molecules you will again have isotactic , if you have alternate configurations then you have syndiotactic and if their configurations are not any regular , they are not arbitrarily placed , then you can again call this is as atactic polymers.	756.5451290094859
Therefore e reacts with a to form ea with k1 and k - .	976.8291122789927
So whether you carry out the reaction by alkali or by the presence of glucose isomerase , the reaction will end up under equilibrium conditions at an equimolar mixture of glucose and fructose and that remains unchanged.	147.33795647272393
And then i will cover polymer , important polymer properties and how the structure of polymer molecules correlates to these properties.	188.2921430333649
So , unless there is a specific organization or specific mechanism occurring in normal cases , trans 1, 4 will be a predominant product compared to a cis 1, 4 product.	646.8352413814845
And another way , we can induce crystallinity in a polymer material by drawing.	158.34953787177548
Then in the case of proteins almost like what we talked about gel structure , collagen and gelatin are typical examples and there is a whole range of synthetic polymers which have been reported and used for immobilizing enzymes which are usually polystyrene based , vinyl polymers , polyacrylamide and so on . you can classify and a large variety of carriers are available for use for immobilizing enzymes and the choice will depend upon various properties that we have listed.	482.73156832418437
These are basically two same reactions , so from here we can write k 1 2 m 1 star m .	148.44537449341925
Obviously as the reaction , reactivity of the functional groups are lower you need high reaction temperature to overcome the activation energy , which requires your your reactions to be done at very high temperature.	221.34092794323288
That summarizes the whole of whatever we have covered in enzyme kinetics.	212.38764251282723
Now , if 4 hydrogen corresponds to 1 1, then how many hydrogen it should correspond to 0.11 divided by 4 multiplied by 0.53, so this is the number of protons , for that particular signal.	757.0520941566343
This is vinyl acetate and i put poly term in between , it will give poly vinyl acetate.	995.8278681982645
We make an assumption depending upon the range in which our substrate concentration exists in relation to km value.	929.816970653804
Now , for simplicity , let us start with , i have a system where a is to be , to functional group , that is the simplest thing we have been discussing , they are in equal number , so 1 is to .	259.34590819764543
And in also know different what are the common step polymers , what are their property and what are the different ways of making step polymers , same polymers can be making different ways.	434.20288447893
If you look at a very generalized scheme of inhibition patterns kes e + s es e + p kei kesi ei esi kes if you consider each of the reversible steps , we are not here really concerned with the irreversible step because that determines the rate of the reaction , the interaction of the reversible step the dissociation constant for this step is kes , this is the kei , this is kesi and this is also kes.	497.20222054749945
But if the diffusion is not the rate limiting step or rather it is quite fast compared to the reaction rate the inherent parameters will be useful.	145.65384339845303
And this is the active side which is electron deficient than that formed by the chemisorption of the electropositive metal alkyl , which has a small ionic radius on the surface of the co - catalyst.	132.78520272605925
And then finally , these polymers will be applied in product , in applications and the step which converts the polymer resins into product is called processing.	464.12965032661435
Now , we continue the discussion we are having in last lecture.	16.59945752229834
So , if you want to stretch , deform it like in elastomer what happen , this conformation entropy is a lost.	662.2354477885522
And , they themself are non discolouring , but they can form chromophoric structures , after they , to this hydroxyl , a proxy radical trapping.	2687.541963274854
Experimentally you cannot determine the vm value because it is a saturation rate asymptotic to the axis and therefore you can never reach that value experimentally.	862.21055990518
Now , the pure , the concentration of pure alpha methyl styrene comes about 7.7 moles per liter.	421.3793314781532
So , if i can write , similarly for r 2 q now because q is always talking about related to monomer.	546.0390034223059
We will continue in this lecture our discussion which we are having the last lecture on polymers in solution.	69.56233281576954
Theoretically the system can be used in a soluble form also but just to make it a continuously usable system the bio element is immobilized.	544.9692076879243
Carriers are usually cellulose , nylon , glass beads etc.	2345.82949152432
Now , you can have the three types of carbonate linkage.	12.657877219159428
You make , say , 5 solutions or 5 different molecular weight; m 1, m 2, m 3, m 4, m5 and then measure the intrinsic viscosity for these eta 1, eta 2, eta 3, eta 4, eta 5 and then plot log of eta versus log of m and get log of k.	2058.195393175638
So , if we , we can plot m versus e versus 1 over t c and from the slope we can , if you know this , by experimental process we can get this values from the slope and interest rate is , so if we know these values we can get the value for del s and del h.	166.4209962756815
It is used in the oxidation reduction reactions and in the absence of any such residue in the active site which can participate in the oxidation reduction reaction , the nad provides a molecule which undergoes redox reaction and therefore catalyzes the reaction.	453.2955427309457
Now , the same expression r p , i can divide into two terms , one is temperature dependent and another is temperature independent.	212.41939057446615
Obviously , the volume , the polymer coil will expand due to this excluded volume effect , so effectively the polymer size , or the radius of gyration and the rms end - to - end distance will also increase.	79.31971804452157
The immobilization method , the carrier and the reagents required for immobilization is another factor which contributes significantly to the suitability of the use of an immobilized enzyme preparations for industrial processing.	261.2194877304389
If you look at soluble starch as substrate as a function of particle size , particle size being in micro meters the km value increases as the particle size increases.	641.2440850446927
Now , let us prove this phenomenal little more.	126.65945350954546
There will be another mechanism which will play a role.	144.42154192049802
But if they are very tightly bound , then they can coordinate.	71.78749844101746
So , it will spontaneously phase separate , see if this any point in this region any composition any solution would be stable , for small change in composition , but it is not stable for a large changes composition beyond this , this point.	435.29077714248984
And the rates the rate materials , in terms of different , this gives the different ratings like v 0 v 1 v 2 h b and those things.	2548.865971181593
They bind in different ways.	56.104692632915025
Km is a true kinetic parameter which is a . . . parameter of the three rate constants and is typically characteristic of any enzyme function and very often km is used as a characterizing parameter for most of the enzymes that are available.	327.4911996686847
Right in the beginning i made it very clear that when we talk of quantification of enzyme it is just not a physical quantity like mass or concentration.	607.3059440807109
Now , before we discuss; in the chemistry , there are some issues about the additives we must consider is , how do they function , the mechanism; obviously , chemistry plays a major role in this.	404.1728818759648
So , changes at t g are less drastic , since the changes are restricted to amorphous regions only , where the crystalline regions are unaffected.	2608.823499166265
One can manipulate and develop number of the strategies like an amperometric . . . type dissolved oxygen electrode what you use in the case of fermentation fluids for measurement of dissolved oxygen.	384.7596997917228
They are , these groups typically hydrolyze very easily , and specially in presence of impurities , metal impurities , and acids and brushes.	2084.7341190506304
Therefore in summary the enzyme will exhibit specificity both with respect to substrate as well as with respect to product.	211.42135872431552
So we are giving example of this back bone stiffness , which will affect the value of t m , so if you have a much stiffer back bone , by introducing rigid phenyle group , the t m goes up to 70 degree centigrade.	189.17750765718435
G0 = rt ln km note that i have purposely removed the minus term from here as km is not the equilibrium constant , is dissociation constant almost like inverse of that and which again also can be equated to.	1630.767293440632
So , now we will move to the; with that example , i will go to the kinetics of step growth polymers.	54.150707532839455
The increase in the quantity of the enzyme required is not very large in the low fractional conversion levels whereas as soon as you cross 0.90 % conversion , the quantity required becomes significantly high.	281.0897444193209
The only surface which is available is the external surface , only part.	647.5847100297859
If they can transform enzymatically using an enzyme something similar to that of fumerase or a modified fumerase probably one can have very significant impact on the enzyme technology.	1704.3896812411883
Only very small fraction will be on the surface and for the reaction to take place the substrate has to diffuse from the bulk to the site of the enzyme reaction.	79.82851135090633
The advantage is in an industry if they have to monitor the penicillin concentration of their bath on an online basis any chemical measurement will take time.	1391.9183244994533
For example , say you have a monomer aa and bb.	41.95978709756025
So , if the third one is of course the molecular involvement which depends up on where the polymer is if the polymer is in a solvent then obviously , if the interaction between polymer and solvent is higher than or main interaction between solvent - solvent and polymer - polymer , then the polymer solvent interaction will be preferred.	143.56874220450425
E + s es e + p k1, k - 1 and k.	20.764875670323594
The temperature where your kd is lies between these; that is the temperature , where the reaction is typically done.	111.43891992104703
The esi complex form is functionally inactive and therefore the k2 is not altered.	899.9014279816109
So , basically there is a unlimited number of polymers , you can , copolymers you can make or polymers you can make by using copolymer.	366.8179911895981
In trypsin by binding on to deae sephadex the free enzyme ph which was 8.5 was reduced to 7..	6128.8634361174545
The second case again with respect to ternary complex formation is ordered ternary complex formation.	137.65046384301937
As i said , they are cross linked network and if these chains between networks , they have flexibility which happens if the temperature at which they are is above their glass transition temperature.	331.19933472127343
We will be mainly , or exclusively discussing the copolymers , where you start with a mixture of two monomer , and then synthesis the copolymer.	225.74132404950126
These are the four major parameters or the factors which cause the various effects on the functional properties of the enzymatic reaction.	160.70645683492754
There are no parameters which can be simply measured.	123.07016147604388
You take a very fine small column and insulate it.	127.95702564474708
What is the mechanism of the reaction.	11.382473633142585
The modified michaelis menten constant in the presence of inhibitor is k m = km ( 1 + i / ki ) so you notice here that the km changes by a magnitude 1 + i / ki but the vm remains unchanged , vm . s on the numerator; there is no change in the magnitude of vm.	148.15639195459931
If you make copolymers , if you take m 1 and m 2, then you can choose from that monomer set and get several combination of m 2, m 1 and m 2 and not only that , for a given set of two monomers you can make different compositions , 0 100, 10 90 to 90 10 and different compositions of , not only you have choices of choosing two different monomers from a state of monomers , also you have choice of making different composition of this copolymer.	887.0664529732292
We know the value for optical constant k , because all the terms remember the refractive index of the solvent molecule we need to get the d and d c value for the polymer molecules; specifically refractive index increment for the molecules; and we know the lambda and so n a , and so on.	236.68652365301304
It was actually going up mildly.	549.1851686459793
So , that is 100, total number of molecules is 5.	157.36411926221382
So , this is clear to you , that from the experimental values of these activation energies you can justify , that if the temperature goes up , the rate of the polymerization will go up and similar time the molecular weight or the number average degrees of polymerization will come down.	51.29944536413247
Simultaneous mass transfer and biochemical reaction in the matrix can be analyzed in the form of a second order differential equation.	39.09653354885912
Now , what you need to covert this raw signal to typically how we represents a polymer distribution.	589.1715892484001
That means the whole rate of reaction is controlled by the rate of diffusion.	41.51231908374757
If they are to react when they collide the rearrangement of the electronic confirmation in each molecule must take place.	496.4051370862505
This is in the case of spherical particles.	32.18192074283325
For the positive it is a anion , for negative it is a cation.	466.62302015646713
Now , from mayo equation we have seen how the molecular weight varies with the chain transfer of the polymers where we can write this is , we have in the last class or the lecture before last one , we had seen , that if there is a chain transfer , then the molecular weight actually drops as the result of chain transfer reaction and this is , this 0 is , this x n bar is the number average degrees of polymerization in absence of any chain transfer reaction.	91.90579348561869
But this is specific to polymer science or polymer chemistry where we apply nmr for identifying the chemical structure , composition and microstructure; obviously , the first one is the identification of polymers , and functional group , and this is same as the way we identify the organic molecules from nmr spectra and functional groups , so this is this is not made from the chemicals shift.	555.9406940557105
Retention of catalytic activity is a very relative term.	209.9922939623839
It includes also analytical enzymes.	629.3484312312397
Third point we also develop s3 v.	2349.3252065147794
Now , c s value , as we seen from the activation energy for transfer reaction and the propagation reaction , that if temperature goes up , c s goes up , which means , x n come down.	149.26639860039228
But one of them , a is not easily accessible to x in the in the native form of the reactant.	204.29268560797763
You know nothing comes cheap.	663.4483812587705
And that is very detrimental for the properties of the you know final polymers , you do not want solvent to be contaminating your polymers.	170.5634974542238
So , this gives the total number of contacts q.	60.635642975422456
Another way is to look at the lineweaver - burk plot.	23.594515520184476
So , these are the possible different temperature where t 6 is the highest and t 2 greater than t 1 and so on.	222.4593452213819
True example of activators will be calcium ions which do not take part in the catalytic function but provides stability to enzyme substrate complex.	408.3424425215714
Now , if we talk about the big polymer manufacturers like dupont , dow chemicals , sabic , bayer they are manufacturer of polymers.	846.9434625071807
And then you you want to get the polymer in a final form of a sheet.	52.687797159775904
So , what we need to do.	4.479904806529708
Such an analysis is applicable only for non - porous particles or in case particle size is very small where the pore diffusional limitations are to be taken as negligible and we will continue with that in subsequent classes.	150.96864326497067
So , you have another m i which will give you n i m i square.	31.73412115390472
They can be plastics , fiber or elastomer.	569.7259908922684
What natta found that , instead of using beta , other forms of titanium chloride like alpha or delta or gamma form of titanium trichloride; if you use this sort of trichloride , then you get a very high stereospecificity , very high amount of isotacticity in this case.	901.3167482985284
That means as soon as the tracer concentration in that plug flow reactor has been inserted after time t or qt / v or one residence time , the tracer must come out in the same concentration in the case of a step input.	236.97301159307858
I must also state here that ideally for most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions we will try to aim at the fractional conversion as high as possible.	221.83005574338966
A typical example of such a reaction is glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase which you also come across in the case of glycolysis.	344.52631226082445
As early as in 1890, fischer proposed lock and key hypothesis which explained the enzyme specificity.	2456.903619308357
The second term which actually determines the polymer will get solubilized in the solvent , you need to find out the value of that.	56.18478489838893
A very typical example in which acid base catalysis is predominantly found is the action of lysozyme.	708.3238212562653
Some bonds are still in the formation stage and therefore the vibrational frequency of the bond that is breaking will determine the rate of the reaction.	97.74700154543414
So , now , we modify the original equations for small point scatterer with a term p theta which is an angular scattering factor and as i said this becomes one for theta equals to 0, and becomes less than 1 for any other value for theta.	1001.5716517952796
Now , of course if you require the control of molecular weight chain transfer , agent , origins can be added if you require or as required by the scientist; so you know what are the ingredients are there in a emulsion polymerization system.	833.2491333092696
As we talked about , we can rearrange this also to get x n is 2 by 2 minus f average into p.	121.71700365765541
If there are two ionisable residues involved , one containing a carboxylic group and amino group and if you add acid or base or change the ph , the ionization state of the two residues will change.	280.16141304198175
Very often the choice of the right type of reactor whether to use a cstr or a pfr is dependent upon the type of the reaction system we are looking at.	331.1231582622116
Being a structural protein , you get a real dispersion of the enzyme.	595.1822616386341
And , we also talked about the peroxides and amine.	128.06903158076827
Usually immobilized enzyme is supplied in the form of sandwich between the membranes so that they can be replaced on the tip.	648.6515763416415
Vm is a parameter and is not a kinetic constant.	122.71257607994576
The km value for the fructose biphosphate forming enzyme is much , much smaller at least thousand folds smaller than the glycogen synthesizing route.	520.4409127663006
So , chains come together so when you take out a noodles you get a junk of polymer or no no pieces of noodles which you take out.	892.4173790108825
I must here again point out that the whole analysis of the immobilized enzyme reactor has been largely dominated by chemical engineering literature particularly with reference to heterogeneous catalysis because the systems are very identical excepting the thermal , specificity aspects which are attributed to enzymatic reactions but the catalysis part whether it is a heterogeneous catalyst in the case of chemical engineering that means a catalyst supported on a solid matrix.	1172.5822685391404
In the case of a batch stirred reactor we have not considered epsilon because the quantity of enzyme or the volume of enzyme in the reactor is negligible compared to the total volume of the reactor.	32.75578711925449
This is volume v and the fraction f1of the total stream q is going into the reactor.	488.0897448771655
So , you know like in hot countries , the temperature may go up to 45 50 degree centigrade.	236.01910030402513
High temperature gpc s are required for crystalline polymer; crystalline polymers are not typically soluble in room temperature.	749.5570287861362
In this case here we do the same thing; a part of the output stream which is the filtrate from the ultra filtration unit is taken out to the product stream and the retentate of the ultra filtration unit is cycled back into the reactor and it can be operated in a continuous shift.	302.96784951662454
This had the characteristic feature in the sense that if you write the michaelis menten equation assuming the substrate concentration and the initial reaction velocity as constants and km and vm as variables although it is little unusual and unrealistic but just for the sake of a mathematical analysis if we write that , we can write for example 1 / v0 = km + s / vm . s if you just take a reciprocal vm / v0 = km + s / s vm = v0 ( 1 + km / s ) we have just written the equation in the form of vm and km as variables.	544.671081939405
But , if you compare the other alternative , which is shown here.	22.32100619368711
The denominator term gives you another three kinetic parameters; k a is the dissociation constant of binding of e to a giving ea.	188.7594643328271
Yes algenic acid.	328.28884848513445
Now , we have initiator which is water soluble , these are typically thus the per sulfate potassium or sodium per sulfate or redox initiators we talked about , when you talked about different types of initiators.	530.8270584393393
So , we can combine these two equations and we get this expression; this covers the original scattering equation by rayleigh and fluctuation theories of einstein and smoluchowski , and this is formed by debye and guinier which quantify the e theta term; angular dependence term.	921.5408764495181
More more example of such can be given where this classification is not completely unambiguous.	406.735657503007
The parameter in the parenthesis influences or depicts the effect of ph on the reaction velocity and this parameter will pass through minima as hydrogen ion concentration is varied and you can get the minimum value by simply differentiating it with respect to hydrogen ion concentration.	418.61104295722953
That can be influenced by binding of the inhibitor.	19.47405638658118
So , there are this is just a to mention that there are other step polymers as well listed in this slide.	213.56210899400455
If it is reacted with the amino group of the enzyme at ph 4 - 5 you get a preparation conh - enzyme.	128.83936889464232
Condensation polymers were the polymers which were synthesized from the monomers by condensation reaction got modified and now , condensation reaction is where the polymer contain or a functional group at the backbone.	947.0192769856261
You can just read fatigue test is for determining the lifetime or durability , hardness is the resistance to surface indentation , abrasion resistance is the weightless by a fine or abrader or the finely divided abrasive particle.	3962.2019239050105
That in some other cases , there could be two screw , which makes that instrument as twin screw extruder.	335.2204350066461
Such modifications can always be looked at.	764.9632341934881
So , if this is a this mouse is made up of anti , this surface is anti - microbial additives , made up by anti - microbial additives then it prevents formation of microbes on the surface of the polymers and that actually prevent spreading of microbes between among people.	1411.1954201828332
So , a alternate copolymer between styrene co - acylonitrile you can write , you should write poly , in brackets styrene , hyphen a l t , hyphen acyolnitrile.	2759.34935694027
A stands for stabilize.	240.62414045071193
There will be some change in the rate of change of concentration of c in the reactor.	22.37853864504204
Next we will consider desirable operational parameters.	266.6803429748699
Now , what i will do.	5.423685115204065
Example is that styrene and vinyl acetate.	103.26335716721358
But the preparations are too fragile because this semipermeable membrane is very , very thin and it provides you a very , very fragile preparation.	1412.688561531992
There is a place to put the gas inside , and there is a gas outlet is also there.	323.02487893209576
For example , if you have a hydrogen peroxide plus farers , so it is giving to h o minus plus h o dot plus f e 3 plus.	907.0459935255338
So the total bed multiplied by the voidage will give a fluid volume in the reactor.	295.5275298529921
It has to be , any outdoor materials , plastics material they come , every day come across the uv light , heat , outdoor heat , rain , and the bacterias and the viruses present in the material , so that is in oxygen of the environment.	1235.1084203582393
We have also seen that under certain set of conditions the classical michaelis menten kinetics which has been proposed for single substrate enzymatic reactions can also be applied to bi - substrate reactions.	106.96064636589003
Then during immobilization , the enzyme may under go some conformational changes.	454.86464031589173
So , that is the reason it is a relative method; it is not a absolute method.	84.3993069658978
So , as a general factor we can say that , only linear polymers can form crystals , if the branches present in the polymer chain , it does not form crystals , or it does not crystallizes.	355.6914991243772
Therefore both have the same relationship as far as the fractional conversion is concerned.	113.43600604538881
So , we have , we have seen how you can get quantitatively the average number , average degrees of polymerization in presence of chain transfer reaction and from this expression we have seen , that if we increase the concentration of chain transfer agents the molecular weight goes down.	67.42738212473452
So , in this case , basically it is showing that there is no char formation is taken place , basically entire polymer is de composed off , and as gone out.	619.0237229151136
As we discussed the higher the crystality , crystalline regions are inpermeable; hence lower is the diffusivity.	101.99114295926707
The total sum will be the sigma on the denominator.	467.31666938839317
That means they recognize the arrangement of atoms at a carbon atom at which stereo isomerism can occur.	1654.4041037392508
Sdh ch2 - cooh h - c - cooh + fad + fadh2 ch2 - cooh hooc - c - h this enzyme is succinic dehydrogenase , sdh.	16157.100471021096
So , there could be three types mainly , one is elastic deformation you probably know that , we say that , elastic deformation happen when a material returns to its original state , releasing the stresses on releasing the stresses , following the same stress strain curve that it to deformation.	1171.8918593857952
Equal to so and so.	1217.0263455934032
Now in this case , you can argue that , this drop in t m could be , because of the increasing flexibility of the back bone , but you write it can cause some decrease in the t m , because of increase flexibility , but the amount of drop shown here , that can be only explain by the decrease in the inter molecular attraction , because of the fraction of the c u n h group , is less in this polymer chain , compare to the one shown here.	314.77111091616
The analogy lies that the reactions that are catalyzed by the enzymes in a living cell if they are carried out in an industrial atmosphere with perfect energetically economical situation , environmentally friendly conditions we have a good friend in enzymes and that is again another basis of use of enzymes in the process industries and also the possibility of studying them in such a great detail.	980.4161012698378
The equipment part is slightly unfavorable in the sense that in the case of continuous flow immobilized enzyme reactor the initial capital investment or equipment may be comparatively higher compared to a batch soluble process or a batch immobilized process.	967.7624854810787
That means the binding site on the enzyme molecule for the substrate is different from the binding site for the inhibitor molecule.	17.738776062488984
Another is if you increase the reactant concentration again there also the frequency of collisions will increase and therefore rate of reaction will also increase.	336.264613040544
This one , a a plus b b b f and where f is 3 or higher.	196.16093092625343
You are referring to this one.	152.8393734772183
So , it basically purify the blood and also pump into the body.	325.4370091423151
So , if i want to find out the defect of rate of cationic chain polymerization with temperature we get this e r like r t case and depending upon the value or sign of e r you can tell whether the reaction rate will increase with temperature or not.	265.4904898564944
The measurement of activation energy is also used as a kind of a experimental data to check whether the system is diffusion limited or not.	368.4966065539649
So , this gives you total mass of i molecule divided by volume mass.	457.26499116782986
In the case of a chemical reaction to take place you have.	31.19753164884872
In the case of a batch reactor the reactor performance can be just simplified integrated form of the reaction equation and that is - ds / dt = k2.e0 km / s + 1 typical michaelis menten equation.	142.65679877473096
This , on reacting on with isobutylene , will produce the . .. . . so , these are the examples of the propagating steps and sometimes this propagation reaction could be complicated and because of this one two hydride shift , but that is not very common.	294.6611767141197
We are taking a water insoluble carrier.	136.08853452199588
Now , let us talk about the restriction on bond angle bond rotation , rotation about the single bond , and which we are talking about because this is this restriction comes out because of near nearby groups.	170.68773746498746
Now , this emulsion polymerization is of great industrial importance , in lot of industrial polymers are made by this process , and it started at the time of world war two.	274.72171025511847
Now , there are 100 of other examples , other applications , these polymers are applied.	247.68845479330636
Now we were discussing about the importance of copolymerization , importance of copolymerization , why we should at all be interested in copolymers.	122.45643364585301
These are the few examples of the ligands which are present in the metallocenes.	102.19870456065208
Now what we will do in the next lecture; we will discuss the strategy how we can and how those ionic polymerization can or would give the isotactic polymerization.	151.30824793856291
To account for the rate of reaction for such reactions taking example of a typical bi - substrate reaction as i have shown here in general i have left certain dots in between , in between the substrate as well as the product stream.	306.69199089836326
If i can write a general reaction like this , this is the rate constant for transfer reaction and this is rate constant for the subsequent initiation a propagation reaction with the a dot molecule.	75.00221317598354
We are breaking polymer or dividing a single polymer chain in to x segments where the size of each segment is same as the solvent molecules.	56.00772812683543
The diffusional coefficient , the . . . diffusivity of a particular substrate in an empty matrix and in the case of an immobilized enzyme particle where the path of diffusion is quite haphazard , it makes a quite a different diffusivity.	567.9783906188263
For example it is a column; it is a stirred vessel or it could be an ultra filtration cell or what ever kind of configuration is available that also can be used and keeping in view a very broad classification can be given on the basis of batch reactors and continuous reactors and the kind of reactor system that i described a little earlier for experimental purposes fall under batch category.	1147.0833894691468
So it is given by this expression and this is what we are looking for the enthalpy of mixing is given by , if you know the values of the solubility parameter then the enthalpy of mixing can be obtained by this expression.	23.38213277227916
So , let us talk about and again , like radical polymerization if any chain polymerization , this cationic chain polymerization we were discussing.	102.31068784557797
All of you may be aware that all the enzymes that are known so far are proteins in chemical nature.	126.29579519534309
It may occupy the same binding site.	152.77052670309217
That means the electro negative oxygen atom of the carbonyl group is attached to the hydrogen of - nh group.	1299.5448856055184
So , what will do we stop here for this lecture , and we will talk about other properties like , optical property , and barrier property , and surface property in next lectures.	192.80768913226046
Now , we are writing this is a f , where f is 3 here.	52.581898584621705
None of these active sites have been designed so for at least for commercial purposes or for practical purposes.	711.3666172430924
And this is you know it is known as nylon 6 6 and this is very common polymers starting from hexamethylene diamine and adipic acids.	388.32780671121515
But we consider the adsorption at range of temperature.	190.67252340969847
That is one method which is used very commonly particularly because of its versatility.	276.876811174405
They can be present in the polymer chain randomly with no order , something like that where you do not have any order of placement between any orders of placement of the monomers.	141.22377969291026
Then you can control your molecular weight and you can target your molecular weight by adjusting the ratio between two monomer or the fixing the value of r.	378.3234785363843
We , we applied the steady state approximation to , to find out the concentration of the radical , total radical present.	93.21473442136839
Now , what is the value of e r and e x n.	16.7292753347579
So , is basically flow state , this example of real polymers , nylon 6 is semi crystalline polymer , is basically drops after t g , it drops very fast and then , after t m this is t m and after t m , it is becomes polymer that , if the elastic modules becomes very low after t m.	659.1467794578034
That means that becomes almost similar parameter like what you considered in case of a soluble enzyme that is specific activity.	609.3397056336702
The other is this can also be synthesized in this form k2b , k3 and k4 and also k - 1, k3, k.	374.10493649374115
So , that they remain in the as a dispersion form because you have this soluble water soluble polymers or the ionic particles which actually act as a stabilizer for this droplets.	557.1789662579749
Now , at any point of time you can find out the size of this emulsion polymer , the particles like miceller particles or the droplets by help of this electron microscopic or light scattering or inter centrifugation.	409.737400424399
We will see the quantitative analysis of the reactor performance in both the cases.	48.215884162527395
If you look for the reaction scheme or the binding pattern which is followed by competitive inhibitors we can write the first stage as enzyme substrate binding.	252.60546165665983
A is the feed reservoir; it is passed through a valve which can direct the reaction vessel either to the reservoir or to the cylinder for pressure.	1175.552765646667
This is the classification based on the iupac nomenclature more from the scientific point of view.	571.6585478532851
How do you construct a zimm plot.	47.002023592964
Here i like you to mark the term biological agents and these biological agents cover microbial cells , cellular organelles , enzymes , may be other parts of the cells like membranes in a variety of biological material that can be used as a catalyst in process industries.	647.5253939875004
The cell does not synthesize because protein synthesis in a living cell is quite an energy intensive process and cells often will like to economise the energy consumption as far the protein synthesis is concerned.	1712.3541518846946
They convert these unstable arylic , allyl chlorides to non allic , non allyl sites; and example dibutyl tin disulfides , and their chemical reaction with the allylic double bond is shown here.	2830.1205357477024
So , that is 1.5 nu , which is 1.5 multiplied by 100, 150 600 by .	1005.7385397925885
The peak resolution is proportional to 1 over d square.	430.28884359204807
To give you a quantitative picture under three distinct conditions here i have taken three different fractional conversions 0.8, 0.9 and 0.9.	971.4074216694294
S m by k is minus n 1; these are simple mathematical step , i am not explaining which you can do yourself.	1564.047446474473
Now , what is the present focus of in a polymer research.	321.0010125223825
