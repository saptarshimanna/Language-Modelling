The graphical representation of such reaction will be substrate concentration versus initial reaction rate.	8.508153999274922
This energy requirement is considered as the energy of activation.	6.619331270083407
There are few other factors which affect t g which does not have any generalization.	9.521734946482633
And ionic copolymerization and not very often done you know , typically as we have said earlier in our discussion earlier lectures that are an carrying out ionic polymerization is always difficult.	10.952711743320403
So , you get m w as this.	5.758442988180565
Ultimately for all practical purposes our measurements or monitoring will be in the bulk.	8.460363420859489
So , from using these to expression you will be able to find out the values for q 2 and e .	8.865313420898037
When we say steady state situation it means that the concentration of any species does not change with time in the outlet stream.	9.164072593042684
And this is the measure of reactivity of the monomer and this two term e p and e m they are the measure of the electronic charges , electrostatic charges on the polymer radical and the monomer respectively.	9.057589547295896
So , we consider we assume that the polymerization is easy and polymerization undergo the monomers undergo almost quantity polymerization or convert almost nearly hundred percent.	8.898003009930312
So , let us discuss little more about this terms s and so basically for a given concentration monomer and solvent this is the value of c s will determine the chains transfer reactions in terms , which will determine the value of the molecular weight of the chains getting produced in this reactions.	9.535835972877987
Polymers as i said , it is never , the polymer crystallinity is not never up to hundred percent , it is always up to semi - crystalline.	12.016793883122803
For example , if you terminate , say i write a general expression , expression for a vinyl polymer and we terminate by carbon dioxide and then acidify the reaction medium , you get carboxylic acid.	9.067343740857606
There are large varieties of enzymes.	6.803176190800247
Another parameter which must be taken into account is regenerability.	9.296509054319186
If suppose in the case of covalent binding half lives are of the order of few months here it may be of the order of few days.	9.29117623451363
At a constant enzyme concentration vm is also constant.	9.028581780000968
Now , if we talk about a cationic ring opening polymerization.	5.261426007627974
The more conversation means more number of chains.	10.179267077167124
So , product might will form much faster rate , if you are not starting the reaction.	8.58786291398736
In that process , we calculated how many different ways , how many distinguishable ways we can introduce all the polymer segments.	9.580428533896564
Under each category also there are number of methods and we need to choose a suitable method for a particular purpose.	10.706512406580268
It immediately brings in a conformational change on the second binding site whereby the dissociation constant reduces to a ks.	10.879798719949875
In our previous lecture , we had discussed some issues regarding the enzyme science particularly the sciences that are associated with the study of enzymes , the nomenclature of enzymes and key issues that relate to the importance of enzymes in the over all perspective of biotechnology.	10.98017350051118
The slope will be - f1 / f.	11.225497603158185
Distribution is defined that the total area under the curve is unity.	12.976284792247496
This is given.	9.92149930713125
Now we can have alkyl peroxides as well; for example cumyl or t - butyl peroxides.	9.3388971449615
That is the enzyme which uses biotin as a cofactor activates the carbon dioxide at the expense of energy of hydrolysis of atp and you get activated carbon dioxide with a negative free energy change which is a spontaneous reaction and this activated carbon dioxide then carboxylates the acetyl coenzyme a to melonyl coenzyme a , an enzyme along with the cofactor biotin is released free.	10.230866345934736
And this are all factors which i listed here , it may not be responsible , you know have different response.	11.064531212451213
So , a value becomes more than 0..	9.266671939500608
I think we will stop at this point today.	4.5579026934060645
The average remains same , but the property; in this case , property being the knowledge or the ability to score marks , changed.	11.105006029312461
In the case of thorell and chance mechanism which we consider as a special case of the ordered ternary complex formation we assumed that the complex eab was very unstable as if the ea directly goes into ey forming a product x and there is no significant concentration of eab present.	8.390518190236484
It has an attractive feature for binding purposes between a and x.	9.583905952334513
The second is the enzyme conformation itself is complementary to the enzyme transition state complex thereby it can stabilize the transition state and increase the concentration of transition state in any given reaction at equilibrium.	11.096255733930493
Now , as i said that like other anionic polymerization this is a living polymerization.	7.6382542635522395
Now , what happened in this case.	9.978598925425809
At time t = 0, 5 at equidistant time if you determine the concentration of the tracer whatever values come at equidistant time , they are plotted in terms of c / q.	11.332764709556601
But this galactose oxidase is a very broad applicable enzyme and it really acts on a variety of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols to give rise to corresponding aldehydes and these aldehydes , the conversion of alcohol to aldehydes oxidation reactions , are of great significance in perfumery and cosmetic industry and a number of reactions can be catalyzed.	10.50601774165242
In this stage , you can add other agents like foaming agents , which makes the final product foam product or you can add the other fillers and reinforcement material.	10.415247095778122
But if we use alkyl aluminum , then what happened.	6.727738087879868
So , we have this is the way we synthesized a block copolymer of this and polystyrene , so from this the nmr structure of this we can get the molecular weight of the first block , and from the nmr of the proton nmr of this second we can get the composition of polystyrene and poly tertiary applied , and obviously , from that we can get , the length block length of the second block as well , how.	9.450903350127978
The substrate has lower affinity that means suddenly from this boundary surface the concentration drops and there is a partitioning.	10.317996962484537
Now , this context you can appreciate that del h value does not depend on the concentration of the monomer whereas , del s value does depend.	8.925912898926383
The molecule becomes rigid; it doesn t deactivate it retains its activity and that is one of the advantage and during this rigidification lot of modification in the substrate specificity also occurs and this has been noted in many cases and coincidentally bulk of the studies in use of enzymes in the non - polar medium has been in the area of hydrolases mainly lipase and proteases.	9.806713194445857
On the enzyme active sites a number of amino acid residues are present which are charged and these charged residues will ionize as a function of ph of the bulk environment and therefore it is required that they are at a particular ionization state in which the enzyme offers the maximum reaction velocity.	9.617867815181215
Talk about a oxygenator which is used during a heart , open heart surgery or talk about applications in car head lamp , aircraft windows and and several high end applications like very high capacity dvds.	11.441515797265504
So , if this not zero , then we consider the sample is birefringence , and for very optically useful material , it is commonly that , the birefringence should be lower.	10.85084939250799
Any catalyst or any chemical reaction if you look at the reaction profile it can be indicated as between time and product formed and ultimately the rate of the reaction at duration dp / dt at the zero time will give you the initial reaction rate.	10.05977909715933
Although the system is designed to mimic or at least operate closely to a plug flow reactor , still the actual performance may be slightly inferior than a plugflow behavior and it might have some kind of a back mixing , partly back mixing.	10.09538810556604
Once they are formed they are not taking part in the reshuffling reaction or reaction with the byproduct reverse reaction with the byproduct.	10.109604337816883
Now , this expression becomes little more complicated when you have copolymers , you are characterizing copolymers.	8.980400244057876
Repeating units it is a structure , a a polymer is formed from repeating units which means that when you write a polymer structures , the repeating unit is the unit which gets repeated.	11.671399707644584
That was the original concept of michaelis menten.	11.239627947998112
So , if i write y phi , this has very strong civilization effect on the radical.	7.466392739232543
I like you to have a look at the substrate gradient.	10.849512392492377
Now , let us just quickly recap what we covered in last lecture on ionic chain polymerization.	5.732795612628318
And unless we have impurities , all we want to stop or terminate the reaction by adding some agent , they , there is no termination reaction.	9.576229622354292
In fact in the living cells also these molecules provide a regulatory device to control the rate of reaction.	7.9821692009982765
We also discussed requirement for crystallization; basically the polymer chain has to have a regular molecular structure , so that the chains can pack close to each other easily , and obviously if the inter molecular force between the polymer chains higher , then they can pack easily , or if they remain pack easily , which are they.	11.494053312247425
Now , you also remember in r p term there was plus half e d term on the numerator and in case of x n there was minus half e d term in the activation energy.	8.58986648343354
That means the proximity may be such that the inhibitor molecule has such a confirmation that the original binding site is disturbed and substrate binding is not feasible or alternatively after binding of the inhibitor molecule the substrate binding site might be modified in such a way that substrate binding is not feasible.	8.60446982391214
Now what happened in case of ionic polymerization of butadiene.	8.517897186260026
We have to start with a good preparation of an enzyme isolated from a living system produced by fermentation or isolated from animals or plant cells.	10.302880066030601
The table means that if you have a reaction with high k to build same molecular weight , in this case average degrees of polymerization of 100 we are considering average degrees of polymers as 100 to reach that level , to reach that molecular weight.	10.137792301455331
So , molecular weight of the repeating unit in this case , this is the repeating unit , is the molecular weight of this entire repeat unit , which is 17.	10.820655014686627
I just recall from your earlier decision , i am writing the propagating reactions here.	9.687087801607788
And then you also discuss radius of gyration again time average quantity , which is the root mean square distance of the , elements of the difference parts of the polymer chain from the center of gravity of the coil.	9.497260683863546
In that case also , the maximum number of group present or maximum number of molecules present is the molecules having lower number of structural units in the chain.	8.231173753140606
This recap in the last lecture , we discussed in detailed a different polymerization processes , and we spent lot of time on emulsion polymerization.	10.1136786682258
Now to have a radical species , to generate a radical species in the reaction medium , you should always prefer or it is very logical that , the radical should not generate at in ambient conditions , like room temperature , where you store this , your monomer or the initiator itself.	11.275499816787564
The enzyme kinetics deals with a quantitative analysis of the effect of various parameters on the rate of enzyme catalyzed reactions.	8.313424024057252
At the start i will be giving you a thorough introduction about the polymers which includes the classification , nomenclature and perspective of molecular of polymer molecules.	9.127183932495972
I must again remind you that this is not a planar site.	9.726180144638121
In this case a dilute solution of polymer sample is mixed with a concentrated matrix solution and the matrix typically of organic acids.	9.312122263255128
So , the ideal scenario of working is somewhere here , where your r is close to 1 and p is close to .	7.194592993730125
As you know , in absence of water this cannot initiate the chain by itself.	8.755769922832554
What are the condition in weather which affect the polymer properties , is uv radiation in most extend , and that will depend upon , which session you are winter summer , what is the exposure angle , latitude , which latitude you are polymer exposed; heat cycles , so that will depend upon what temperatures , what is your air temperature and so on.	9.975240514323307
For example , if i take the molecular weight of this as m 1 and this as m 2 then how do you get the polymer molecular weight.	7.523979111545389
Now , we know x n is 1 by 1 minus p.	4.699204164017575
So , basically the techniques which are used are utilized to determine or to get information about polymers samples as multi angle light scattering or small angle x - ray scattering or small angle neutron scattering.	8.137751894406328
Most commercially used radical initiators are like benzoins.	12.661918517111802
The two forms are present in equilibrium.	9.12559640793651
And you can for example , high density polyethylene which has low branching , high crystallinity , high density.	10.812260389264841
The rates may not be absolutely very far apart if the two are very comparable in that case we need to consider our apparent reaction velocity as equal to vapp = k2e0s / kappm + s here when we say that the apparent parameters are those which can be modified , which can be taken care by reactor operation.	11.087144472510982
The other additives used for pvc stabilizations , like soaps of cadmium , zinc , barium salts; and , they act as acid scavengers.	10.289538817566633
The strain on the reacting group was one of the mechanisms.	11.601530101249537
Now in these conditions , one with a syringe in one thermistor one solvent drop is placed; in another thermistor or solution polymer solution drop is placed.	9.677251100246803
The third type initiator redox initiation could be inorganic reductants plus inorganic oxidants , which give rise to.	10.181534865901073
So , this part glassy part will behave like a perfect elastic.	8.467411360421737
So , if you have monomers which are very different in their polarity of the double bond , then they will tend to form alternate copolymers.	7.459743770551913
If you just get the value of s0.9 and s0.1 you know original hills equation v / vm = sn / k + sn s0.9 = nv9 k , s0.1 = nvk / 9 and the co - operativity index will be nv8.	9.26101756777554
There are number of examples in practice for such kind of a behavior in the reaction.	7.923115165851773
So these are the typical examples of the radical initiators.	9.648272027541609
But on the other hand because a covalent bond formation involves very reactive reagents for carrying out the reaction at room temperature or ambient conditions , it is bound to effect the confirmation of the enzyme protein.	9.441523429560501
So , as the molecular increases , this goes to lower and lower composition.	7.711854223232915
I will try to explain what it means in a minute.	6.578155674649341
There could be inorganic lights stabilizer or photo stabilizer as well , for example , carbon blacks; and , they have particle size from 20 to 40 nano meters; and , they are very effective absorber; but , obviously , they can be , all be used in samples , which are meant to be black.	12.13766533624975
So you need an initiator molecule which can initiate the free radical reaction and temed , n , n , n , n tetra methyl ethylene diamine is used as the catalyst.	7.9330921076353
Coming back to the role of the energy of activation on the reaction rate constant , if you take arbitrary value of energy of activation , say from 25kcal mol - 1 downwards to 5kcal mol - 1, a decrease of activation energy results in a very significant increase in the reaction rate.	10.105723898084243
So , what is the conversion.	5.616817446063002
What happened in case of a polymer material.	11.689783331864987
Now , which is even much stable stabiler than the previous case , because here in this case it is stabilized by resonance.	10.440635090898281
For example when we consider the optimum temperature of the reaction and the optimum ph for the reaction that is probably one of the primary objectives of establishing the whole kinetics analysis.	9.883948162094596
So this means this is a tortures path , and higher is this tortures path , the higher is the barrier , to the gas to pass through.	11.041590362603062
They also calculated the same reactor performance using the analytically developed reactor design equation and they found almost very good fit both in the case of sphere as well as in the case of disks.	11.179886306635545
And if that is the case , then you can imagine the situation like this; where because of resonance , these ionic charges are distributed can in the three atom.	10.497333677279606
Still in some cases the partial failure takes place and the kidney is not able to filter out or remove urea.	11.0808267984056
So , n x will be given by n 0, 1 minus p square , p x minus .	7.779504020643773
And if we write f 1, is the molar ratio , or mole fraction.	8.649781592267512
So , there is no special and so it can come from this or it come from this side as well.	7.769126367524945
It can also be carried out by colloidal platinum.	9.244842062778952
The cross linking methods involve intermolecular cross linking of enzyme molecules in the presence or absence of a solid support.	10.631702422593257
So if you want to compare between two polymer chains , it is preferably to compare in high molecule rate , so that the t m is almost independent of the molecular weight.	8.834877454075817
He also mentioned that the interaction between enzyme and substrate to form enzyme substrate complex is in perfect equilibrium.	9.055206348778635
If suppose the carrier cannot be regenerated and it has to be replaced the replacement of carrier is much simpler in the case of cstr.	8.198136084013838
In fact when we distinguish them or when we compare them with a variety of chemically catalyzed reactions or even uncatalyzed reactions they are distinguished by virtue of their specificity.	9.698693896697236
Today with an understanding of the site directed mutagenesis , it is possible to change the substrate specificity and also improve the catalytic functional rates.	11.63271627797211
But still to produce glucose fructose syrup for many of the food industry applications and the major consumer of glucose fructose syrup in india is the beverage industry.	10.371366027519167
So , for shorter molecular weight the contribution from chain , hence the significant , hence the t g is low.	8.641922825382805
Now we have said or we have seen earlier that in case of ideal solution , the sizes of solute and the solvent molecules are similar.	8.404396315626244
The second thing after getting the rate expression for those different mechanisms of the bi - substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions is the procedures by which one can discriminate between different mechanisms.	8.762067529383181
Only difference is that the role of acids or alkali in the chemical catalysis is played by the functional groups on the active sites.	8.027127168312537
Some of the activator molecules may be absolutely essential for a given enzyme reaction.	9.328483923079334
Multivariant means that more than one physico - chemical interaction is involved in binding.	12.528547511546753
Now , you join them , you join to get a line for the binodal points and a line for the spinodal points.	7.358811589674588
Then we consider each enzyme species in sequence.	9.999899690142954
In the lab , there are more sophisticated statistical method and which are computerized.	10.721841061806794
So , i have the chain transfer agent which has generic structure life.	8.00961597337955
It doesn t matter whether you pack it in a horizontal fashion or a vertical fashion the tubes are used as the immobilized matrix whereas i am talking about that the enzyme which is used in the soluble mode.	9.815439192510198
You can analyze the product and see where the phosporyl group has gone.	10.020640508606151
Secondly he could also generate data using buffered substrate.	10.441930351061409
Let us talk about the effect of backbone stiffness; backbone of the polymer chain.	6.147242702774934
Standards state for monomers is either pure monomer , pure monomer or 1 molar solution of monomer , whereas for polymer , it is pure amorphous polymer , pure amorphous polymer or slightly crystalline polymer , or , or 1 molar solution of polymer repeat units.	11.138611752773556
Then from the point of view of biochemical engineers probably a very important requirement for enzyme kinetic study is to design enzyme reactors.	8.94952578773381
Very few cases , almost rare cases are there where one notices this kind of un - competitive inhibition.	8.938243523743516
If you make a plot of this curve a semi logarithmic plot that means ln c / c0 or ln 1 - c / c0 verses time you will end up with a slope of q / v and intercept of ln 1 that is zero.	9.047732606707994
This film thickness will depend on various physical properties of the fluid.	10.404927869767771
Now , if you look back the flory - huggins expression we have two terms the first term from the combinatorial entropy , which can predict theoretically if you know the volume fractions of the polymer and the number of moles of the polymer molecules.	8.425524527620631
And then it forms a cyclic transition state.	7.866468408518181
Now , we extrapolate this data.	6.557205679522924
Now , let us go back and see the effect of structure and reactivity.	6.077818517500347
So , it drops after t g but , because of the cross linking , if the presence of the cross linking , the elastic modulus or modulus does not drop significantly after after a value.	9.031053927715687
Non - draining polymer molecule is where , the solvent molecules will within the coil , coiled polymer chain moves along with it , so if i think this why it is the column , and the coil and these circles are solvent molecules when the polymer moves , it takes the solvent molecules along with it.	10.761567158894902
So , we need to do calibration and then we need to do the normalization of the detector signals.	8.58140432520971
You can increase on the complexity by taking more and more number of ionization.	10.778763513812175
If they are terminated by coupling reaction , then every dead chain would have two species from the initiator molecule , the fragments , residual fragment form initiator molecule.	8.064535989443566
If you put cellulose into it , it might get degraded totally.	11.023064444169076
So , it forms a four membered cyclic transition state.	6.144931414725716
Then the third area of application of enzyme , analytical application i am referring to , is the structural analysis of bio macromolecules.	10.09773455314945
Other than fructose , it will produce cyclose and galactose and all other sugars which are not desirable in the product.	10.758024853752017
That means the transition state will be able to break down and form the products.	8.3962156824477
That means at a very small change of concentration , the reaction velocity can be very high.	7.51156420430475
Although they are related it also involves the concentration term of the other substrate which is b and a similar relationship like this when you consider constant concentration of a and the apparent km for b.	10.84081625064503
You have a gold cathode , silver anode and teflon membrane at the tip; that is the main electrode has a teflon membrane on the tip.	11.658643094346653
So , if you consider just a liquid , then there will be lots of you know , then there will be lots of intermolecular spaces which are not occupied by the molecules; that those are free volumes.	8.941098950036514
Then reduction of side reactions catalyzed by water.	11.091911164910227
So , i will , ethylene dyol ed , which gives you polyethylene teritarate , plus water.	8.816674769574565
Now just as an example if you look at isomerization of glucose to fructose , the reaction can be catalyzed by an alkali say naoh.	9.240348494455327
Now n 1 by n 1 plus x n 2 we can write this as phi 1 is the volume of fraction.	9.782226058372824
Now , as i said , that in normal case , whatever temperature we use for most of the polymers , this is .	8.236293904722523
I can write a general structure like this.	7.088227443765662
Other than the reaction kinetics there are other physical parameters which get involved particularly diffusion and partitioning , which we will discuss in detail.	10.298618610315073
Now , what is what is the problem here the only one thing to consider that this is a water soluble monomer , this bisphenola in a sodium hydroxide solution and this phosgene is formed through the organic medium in this case methylene chloride.	10.284637467048139
Then we are talking about freely drained , freely draining polymer molecules , so solvent molecules flow past each segment of the chain , and you can think that it is dominate about rod - like molecule , if you molecule is stiff , if you rod like molecule , then obviously , when it moves the solvent molecules will not be sticking to it.	11.65040840902892
So , similarly , you can name other step growth polymers as well where you have to first indentify the functional group or the class in which they belong and then accordingly you name the polymer.	10.707977646907901
So , if i this is temperature and this is 100 degree centigrade is your t g for t n m a in this case this is mole friction of the polymer , if this monomer mole fraction of the polymer is one then the t g would be 100 degree centigrade for the pure polymer.	10.660989570836096
Now in that case , that will minimize the surface scattering , because the surface is now smooth , because they are dipped in liquid.	10.454237154632766
So , this is not an absolute method; we need calibration.	7.168823825517224
So if you composition , you get linear variation by this equation.	9.167235711377442
It will look like this , but if i write the same molecule polyethylene oxide then it will mean this.	10.926346750239945
The major limitation , you also noticed during our understanding of the structure - function relationship of the enzyme , is that they are usually very unstable and that probably is one of the major limitations as far as enzymes are concerned with respect to their application.	11.046879520247522
This will be little complicated , but for , simply we can do it at lower temperature , then that thermal decision does not come , does not play effect.	9.455154043633618
But if you consider the first order regime the performance are quite different and if you compare the relative performance , relative quantity of the enzyme required that is ecstr , the quantity of enzyme required in cstr and pfr relative quantities or we can define this term as erel will be equal to ecstr / epfr = erel = - x e / ( 1 - x ) ln ( 1 - x ) the relative quantity of enzyme required in the case of cstr and pfr under first order regime can be given by this expression.	8.146403886069587
But other wise a quick quantitative measure of the conformational loss is only through measurement of enzyme activity.	9.604390713010359
So , how did we get that x n bar remember x n bar was the number of molecules at t is equal to 0 and number of by divided by molecules at end of the polymerization.	7.432102248873075
This implies that the enzyme binds ab * more tightly.	11.698361774578245
There is a commercial product by the name accurel , which is a microporous carrier consisting of polypropylene , butyl or hexyl sepharose etc.	10.567482439054565
This is inhibited by a molecule closely resembling the substrate , malonic acid which has two carboxyl groups but only one methyl group , unlike succinic acid.	9.733644612469362
If you have other polar solvents , like say ketone , what happens.	7.499053010974415
This system which has been followed in the past has lot of problems.	11.348842558808558
So therefore one has to also look about the deactivation kinetics because that will also play an important role.	9.545861823480523
Reversible inhibition is caused by chemical modification of one of the amino acids residues on the active site.	8.094567609718355
So , strategy is for controlling in a step polymerization.	7.031634209088861
They can only react when the rearrangement of the electronic distribution in each molecule perhaps by transfer of atoms from one molecule to the other takes place.	9.34753387501573
There is no chance of any temperature gradient.	6.74151160245462
Of course they depend upon the reactivity of the monomers in this a and b and obviously the feed monomer composition.	9.088013858309047
If there is enzyme which is intercellular and the recovery or purification cost is very high probably immobilized cells will provide an answer.	10.403602119033074
The thiele modulus on the numerator is ktrue that is the true rate constant which is k2e0 / km in the case of enzyme reactor for first order or in the case of zero order it is k2e.	10.975818715589684
Now the problem is that experimental measurement of the film thickness is not an easy task.	10.66477276375597
To provide stability to this film usually this film is subjected to crosslinking either by butyraldehyde or by ferric chloride.	10.24111685647051
Because , the re - activities of these accidents , accidental call , they form ester is , is not very highly , highly feasible reaction.	9.305351667156335
So if i want to summarize , just plane structure in short of substitutions.	8.74375228330906
These reagents can combine or they can activate the carboxylic group containing matrices to give , under acidic conditions , usually ph 4 - 5, ortho acyl iso urea derivative.	10.625595701926516
In the last lecture , we were discussing about different types of molecular weight of polymers , and we defined number average molecular weight , weight average molecular weight , z average molecular or z average molecular weight , whatever you call , viscosity average molecular weight.	7.628247548081235
These are some of the major mechanisms by which enzymes reduce the energy of activation.	5.703964729253796
In a steady state the molecular weight comes down as time goes , sorry it is the other way round , molecular goes up and as time progresses or time increases.	10.647661797789365
The d s c is different term; differential scanning calorimetory , and differential thermal analysis.	9.060149147636526
So , you have to at the end of the polymerization you have to take out the poly carbonate by steam precipitation if you steam precipitation.	7.224130719648459
If you have good melt flow behavior , then you can do the processing easily.	8.972722344955246
So , what happened , in terms of pictorial representation and this for a proton molecule , this pins are randomly oriented , when there is no external magnetic field , now in the absence of any external magnetic field , these are randomly oriented.	9.893824081161473
Hence t m is given by delta h m , delta s m.	11.246025199451019
So , in this spectra corresponds to 1 styrenic munity , and 4 point may be about 4.28 mma munity , which means the composition percentage of mma is 4.28 1 plus 4.28 into 100, which gives around 8.	10.221903916270593
It doesn t directly interpret the multi substrate reactions which are so common in the case of biochemical systems.	10.604066016542399
The other way to handle is to develop the full flow models which can vary in degree of complexity depending upon where you can either consider the dispersion as a parameter and thereby you can write dispersion mass balance equations based on dispersion and finalize the reactor performance equation.	10.108416108839755
Their weight could be more because monomers , dimmers presents in not significantly contribute any polymer properties in the weight which will contribute more in terms of polymer properties.	10.72012219403127
Another strategy is taken for making sheets and all this things that you make a pre - polymer which is not very high molecular weight.	9.48920496588327
So , let us again take example of , say , isoprene.	7.927311701201064
So , what happened soon as situation will come where the all the surfactant actually consumed , and you have a fixed number of particles which are active , where the polymerization is going on.	9.466042519737707
If i write the chain initial reaction for that electron transfer reaction , it can react with the monomer to initiate the chain say y s , styrene , we are talking about styrene polymerization here.	9.152166533622113
Large number of enzyme electrodes have been prepared and listed here are the ones which are commercially available.	11.549674188151172
The other or a method , we talked about that method , where we burn the sample from a particular distance , under particular condition and in presences of some ignitable materials like cotton.	10.013825777150851
So , when the polymers come out you need to have a detectors which will detect and in most of the cases , because we want to get the concentration of the polymers which are coming out; we usually use concentration detectors in gpc and most common use is refractive index detector; and also in some cases we also uv visible spectrometer which basically is the polymer has some groups which absorb in visible region then we can get the concentration of polymer in that solution by uv visible spectroscopy.	10.55546743544492
And in next lecture what i am planning is to give the process of synthesizing different step polymers , like polyesters , polycarbonate , and it give you the chemistry of what is the reaction is carried out in real sense , in practical sense , to make this step polymer.	10.85454330686323
As long as we maintain this , this happens , then all the chains starts from same time and proceed or propagate for same time , so the polydispersity becomes very narrow and so , as long as you maintain or the reaction have initiation reaction is faster compared to propagation reaction.	9.981322269955001
Because isolation , purification is a very cost intensive operation for intercellular enzymes.	11.451389795394345
X . s0 / tau.	11.749447558676295
Now , this does not capture the numerous confirmations a polymer chain exists.	9.414823995824799
If you rearrange you get ( ds / dx ) out - ( ds / dx ) in 2 - . v = 0 dx rd if you take limit dx tends to zero you can write simply as the second order differential equation d2s / dx2 2 / dr.	9.472066550439449
So , if you do it activation for curio oxide acid , you can get the fraction of from beginning.	8.024345762820053
Even if you allow for a long period the loading is usually not uniform.	10.832137341942925
When the bulk solvent is water and the continuous phase is water there is no disturbance on this surrounding layer and the enzyme remains stable for a reasonable period of time.	10.097304113338689
This film thickness can vary depending on the physical properties of the substrate solution; for example viscosity or density.	10.471084428374331
Now , if you look at the slides we had during last 2 lectures the in our discussion on chain copolymerization , we basically covered these topics different types of copolymers , importance of copolymerization , and copolymer composition.	7.809199253905568
Now , if you found in the reaction they is high very high molecular weight , which you do not what then what you can do you can use this chain transfer agents which we have.	10.82867545396722
You get a high , very high molecular polyethylene.	8.131259973651632
This is typical thermo gravimetric curve of different polymers , pvc pma ldp ptfn pi in nitrogen , and these temperatures are corresponding on said temperature , and the 50 percent temperature , the temperature for example , for pma this is the temperature correspondence to 50 percent weight loss.	11.703408583749567
If you take a simple monosubstituted monomer and then consider what happens when this polymerize; now we can consider a polymer where you can have two types of stereo chemistry , you can have this.	9.884018148936851
You have also seen , that it is always preferred , that you have a higher k value , higher equilibrium constant.	7.324079685683425
If you consider the slopes and the intercepts of this plot , a replot of the slope will give you ki.	8.700641122607372
Although this kind of situation is practically feasible in a laboratory experiment where you can have a very high height to diameter ratio and have a very uniform packing in the reactor so that the plug flow characteristics are realized in the laboratory but on a large scale reactor which are real industrial reactors the possibility of achieving the ideal flow patterns that means either a complete perfect back mix or a perfect plug flow reactor are usually far from reality and most of the reactors operate closer to the one of the regimes but also have a partly mixed behavior.	11.396991259424365
If the partition is more for one of the particular monomer , then that monomer will be available for copolymerization more , than the other monomer.	10.869162828884768
So , if you are talking about a polyesterification reaction , what do you get at 99 percent conversion level.	6.347311945033663
And it are used for monomers at acetate , methylmethacrylate and other acrylate polymers , and it also applied for that copolymers like styrene , abs and rubber and fluoronitated to the olefins.	11.092230000570625
You can control the ph and temperature of the reaction and you can carry out the reaction in the laboratory.	8.343232657585968
The advantage of metallocene polymerization is that , as i said that this can happen in a homogeneous condition and at the end of the polymerization it can isolate the monomer , isolate the catalyst and purify and then we reuse the catalyst one more time.	9.174548863778696
So , d ln x n , which gives you the rate of change of molecule , degrees of , average degrees of number , average degrees of polymerization as similarly e x n by rt square , where e x n is e p minus half e d minus half e t.	8.806731855283836
Now , in this case , you have the highest reactivity , most stable monomer.	5.884324495640695
So , this reaction , this k k of this reaction would be given by this.	6.441435662413881
Because of , the low surface energy , it migrates to the surface during processing and the coefficient of the friction of polymers are very low.	9.246602868479428
If you think yourself or if you read magazines and talk to the older people then you will find that in last century whatever new material development has happened polymers will rank as one of the top.	10.988621919718819
And , these final species like stilbene quinine , benzo quinone , they basically are sometimes colour bodies.	9.233499571714532
Take for example a candidate like lipase - the enzyme that hydrolyses lipids into the consequent fatty acids and glycerol.	10.387940304681411
Input and output here are taken as zero because there is no continuous input and output.	12.406263106294645
For example , if we have gpc with ri plus light scattering detector , the light scattering gives us the limiting excess rayleigh ratio delta r theta is equal to 0 and if you are working a very dilute solution we can consider concentration c is equal to .	8.495044801176679
So there will be apparent shift in the ph optimum because what we are considering we are not varying the ph in the carrier particle; we are varying the bulk ph.	10.643175775093614
In the case of batch reaction at any given time all the enzyme must be in contact with the total substrate feed.	7.755268824983262
So , with the exposer to uv light , it turns yellow; as a result of that , bond cleavage will be high energy uv light; and , as the result , the polymer becomes embrittle.	10.332201590270275
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in this lecture number 22, we are going to continue our first half our discussion on chain copolymerization.	5.180757786929228
So , these are the main two reasons why this ionic chain polymerization , are not practiced that commercially in that scale.	8.645878614974627
Most complex chemical processing plant say for example petrochemical complex where the petroleum is fractionated into various products and i like to give you a very simplified analogy of a living cell to that of a chemical process plant.	11.250205290456979
Hence it is very difficult to get a quantitative idea or is very difficult to predict the reactivity ratios of the monomers from a given structure.	9.140903538822025
Out of the several mechanisms , in one of the mechanisms this k a may be equal to k and the rate expression will accordingly get modified.	11.107071305247002
Nonetheless if you compare ionic copolymerization and with radical copolymerization we can understand the differences and the in that way we can understand , say the characteristics of ionic copolymerization.	11.479792609098679
Similar profile an alternative profile is eadie hofste plot.	11.15366508220747
So , as p is 1, if you have some molecular weight in target , you can use this formula and you can complete the reaction in such a way , now r is the ratio of the functional group of the two bi - functional monomers.	9.068813098442568
If we put a factor to equate them , now this has to be more than 1, and this is called expansion factor , so if this is 1, then these are equal if there are more expansion , then this will be higher than .	11.730335176701415
If you put n = 1, then the equation will get into michaelis menten kinetics.	7.989699298766833
So , n 2 is the number of moles of the solute.	6.049465899992726
To be able to drive the reaction in the forward direction you need to adjust the ph so that the concentration of hydrogen ions can be reduced and therefore the reaction can be driven.	11.445440322335145
So , what we need to do.	4.479904806529708
One is the external film diffusion.	5.623514601740658
So , the counter ion is not tightly bound; so strongly bound with the active anion end.	7.681715597395422
Obviously , mixing has former general knowledge and general understanding that any mixing generally gives in increase in entropy.	9.604389186634949
S0 = ( s ) + ( p ) + ( x ) if you write all the expressions in a rate term you will find the concentration of x will be [ x ] = k1e0 [ s ] + k - 2 [ e ] 0 { p ] / k - 1 + k2 + k1 [ s ] + k - 2 [ p ] but as a matter of fact one can always neglect x because it s too small a concentration compared to s.	9.278201185433161
Second mechanism by which , some of the additives may function is by forming insulating char on the substrate , as we just discuss in a minute.	10.063845280106655
So , that is the fundamental difference between x n in case of radical polymerization and in x n in case of step growth polymerization.	6.262720993010181
Again m 1 and m 2 will get in incorporated randomly in the copolymer chain , and f 1 would be same as f 1, and f 2 would be same as f 2, because the reactivities , the monomer reactive ratio of this two are same , and they are one.	9.788288747526131
Looking at the first method that is the gel entrapment it involves entrapping the enzyme within the interstitial spaces of cross linked water soluble polymeric gels.	11.425461026905833
Now this are some of the factors , we try to include , and will see that most of this factors also influence the value of t m , because t m and t g are very closely related phenomenon , so this factors also will contribute , may be , may not be in same extent or same nature same way , but they also contribute , in determining value of the glass transition temperature.	10.181186676043634
Now , from mark houink and sakurada equation we know that intrinsic viscosity given by k m to the power a where k and a are constant for a particular polymer solvent temperature combination.	9.762909426023185
So , once the polymer become glassy then the polymer chain the kinetic chain are not participate for the reaction and cannot take the cannot make new polymers.	9.712740972965719
The permeability is opposite to the barrier , basically more permeable means less barrier , or more barrier means less permeability.	11.258720994840186
And these copolymers are typically synthesized by emulsion ionic polymerization , these copolymers with high styrene containing high amount of styrene can are used as a latex paint , where the styrene is cross - linked little bit with unsaturated di - carboxylic acid.	10.026146040245925
The system is mass transfer limited.	11.103402320857104
Ph . if suppose the product of the reaction provides you a change in the micro environment; let us say hydrogen ions are produced.	12.25107007269434
L c s t can be observed for this two cases as well , where we have psi parameter negative; another polymer is polyehtyleneglycol , you can have l c s t because you have a strong interaction between the polymer and the solvent.	9.608746715567209
Polymers are the molecules which we synthesize from the monomer , they are individual molecules or a mixture of molecules , but we do not use when you synthesize a polymer from , in the lab or in a plant we do not use , in a seldom use as the polymers as synthesized.	11.206083204018942
So in this case the entropy change is also lower , so if you think about the thermo dynamics of this chain polymerization , briefly , at this movement , because this is exothermic negative , and this is also negative , so there is a completion between these two term.	9.962147835611866
Similarly , if you change the strain rate , strain rates means the the the d l by a l value , the fast you are the fast you are changing this applying strain , see your the first deformation will change the stress strain behavior.	9.522956150363864
So , more and more cyclization happen , the degrees of polymerization also come down.	6.903442239693964
The first thing that we must look at is the pattern of binding of inhibitor to enzyme or enzyme substrate complex.	7.735049045405717
Today we will discuss two of those cases that do not represent the reaction velocity profile in terms of hyperbolic kinetics.	11.449155788542882
It is mediated by series of transferases and then ultimately the transferases and ligases.	9.593457041779791
Typical example of organic carriers are polysaccharides , cellulose , agarose , even cross linked dextran what we call industrially as sephadex.	11.599228050033943
Now , the second mechanism , which is a monometallic which is proposed by cossee and arlman.	10.115830293211786
Now , by from looking at the structure of this molecule or in polymer molecule it is , because it is , has a heteroatom in the backbone with the group it seems like it is a chain growth , step growth polymers , but it is the mechanism of this polymers resembles more of a chain polymers of the type i mentioned in last page , so more close to chain polymerization.	10.730865611030898
So , they will , the sequence distribution of this case of the repeat unit in this copolymers is random , so you will get.	9.05744330544124
Consider simply a hypothetical case in which we have enzyme active site shown by this x , z ellipse.	12.512555477043264
Now of course there is another condition that force acting between the like and the unlike molecules; similar and dissimilar molecules are equal or in other words if you have , say , 1 as your solvent and 2 as your solute , then interaction between 1 - 1 solute - solute solvent - solvent and 2 - 2 solute - solute is same as the interaction between the solute and solvent molecules which is 1 - 2 interaction.	9.958627667091895
Among the batch reactors there are mainly two types of configurations that are very commonly used; one is the stirred tank where you use almost like a tank with the stirring facility.	12.052469048674718
To get such a performance if you carry out the reaction at a low substrate concentration or even at a high substrate concentration degree of conversion fractional conversion is very high though the reactor performance will be closer to the first order kinetics.	9.104090074450255
They can in a because in a , they have two defined functional group at both the sides.	9.15910826644653
Now , for a given molecular rate , if you consider one molecular weight here and keep the molecular weight , and change the shapes like from raw to coil to sphere; obviously , this sphere will have lowest size then coil then rod.	10.07950273409827
Now , some books , some texts follow that this is 0 degree , so do not confuse , in this course telling this is 180 degree , and this is 0 degree because we will use this phi in the expression of rms end - to - end distance as well , so this phi is equal to 0, and this is phi is equal to 180 degree.	9.776133213904597
So , basically now we know that with these how to both q and e and how the basis of these values q and e how to experimentally or semi empirically get these values of q and e in comparison to arbitrarily they assigned values of styrene.	9.542987153280315
Typical examples are adsorption; covalent binding and we will be discussing them in detail.	10.4806074719735
There is lot of variation in terms of their characteristic features required as a specific catalyst.	9.37287006487932
So , you get a universal calibration curve.	5.703146665047438
As i mentioned that we have to look for enzyme and one of the major advantage of immobilized enzyme is that they can be reused , they can be repeatedly used , continuously used and therefore they must possess a much higher stability than the soluble enzyme.	9.255901791883348
The various methods that involve the coupling of enzyme by adsorption to a matrix and their characteristic features and as i mentioned that the immobilization methods must be evaluated on the basis of their yield , operational stability and carrier regenerability.	9.908834936834825
It does not need any external initiator like chain polymers.	8.379816739790817
If you consider e0 as a variable then k2 / km is a constant which is considered as specificity constant.	8.730709743597755
We can continue to write this is as summation of eta i c i by c.	8.976751676033183
This is of the order of p.	7.343310618942162
A whole range of basic and engineering sciences are required to be understood.	9.567972024461854
In that case they will tend to look as if both the ionizations result are merged and you get a sharp profile because here the pka values of the two amino acid residues are seven and eight which are pretty close.	9.89634827561531
Because of steric effect , these 2 individual monomers , they cannot homo polymerize because they are 1 2 substituent.	10.00604479749744
Now , if you look at this solvents carbon tetra chloride and carbon tetra boride they are also have very high chain transfer constant.	7.3709436978581175
At least you can distinguish whether the enzyme reaction follows the binary complex mechanism or ternary complex mechanism by just evaluating the value of k a.	9.827440461058657
In terms of molecular level , the polariziability in one direction , and the perpendicular direction; say for example , one very higher aromatic polycarbonate , where they are different , so their molecularly birefringent , but we do not measure the molecular birefringent , we measure the microscophic birefringent for example , and that is given by the difference in the refractive index , in the two different direction.	11.212533197867653
Or miceller concentration with both the r p rate of polymerization goes up; as well as the number average degrees of polymerization.	7.943860125721122
One : that reactivates of both functional groups in a bi functional monomers are same.	8.829678008487434
Now , does it mean , that always you have formation of cyclic , for example , 14 and higher members.	11.006242670758981
To expand further on the briggs - haldane s kinetics based on the reversible enzyme catalyzed reaction if you recall what we got v = { k1k2 [ s ] k - 1 k - 2 [ p ] } e0 / k1 [ s ] + k - 2 [ p ] + k - 1 + k2 the original reaction rate expression was developed by briggs and haldane for reversible reaction that means you carry out the reaction either from the reverse direction or in the forward direction starting from s or starting from p and you can arrive at rate expression in terms of substrate and product concentration.	9.364022211884842
So , the third peak would be from this , now from the ratio of the intensity of these three , we can like in this nmr green spectra , we can find out what is the ratio of this particular type of present in the copolymer.	9.505318366167803
The thickness of the stationary film can be reduced by changing the flow properties in the reactor stream and as we will see further that the effect of thickness of the stationary film can be reduced if you increase the linear field velocity in a continuous reactor or increase agitation speed in a stirred vessel in a stirred reactor.	9.146118357155043
Mind the word that you need an inert tracer which can be detected.	13.246232129100918
They may be equal to in some cases or they may not be equal to because ultimately the multiplication of the two dissociation constant in reaching to eab will be same.	10.831676115801802
So , higher the molecular weight , lower is the pdi.	8.993976810868967
S that is only for the sake of convention but the laws of thermodynamics do apply and the vant hoff equation is also applicable , the second law of thermodynamics is also applicable and therefore you can write ln km =.	10.549134965867363
So , if you do not mention t i nor if you just write t then; that means , it is the initial temperature of the thermostated chamber.	9.92488293471467
But hypothetical situation is that if all the enzyme is say saturated with the substrate then you have a maximum reaction rate which is called vm.	11.718879722344694
See , if you can , if you take this type of chain and you add second monomer b , then you can make a block copolymer.	9.21799420194553
In a semi crystalline polymer , crystalline region are highly densed region , and basically it acts as very high barrier , to any diffusion through it.	9.044386082849819
Then , it can undergo reversible addition and form this differentiate make r star , this radical.	8.65179697648931
We know x n bar multiplied by average molecular of the structural units and x n bar is mole fraction multiplied by the number multiplied by the number which is given by x n 0 1 minus p square p to the power of x minus 1 sum over x , and if you do this math , you will land up 1 minus 1 minus p m w is x w bar m average x w bar is weight fraction multiplied.	9.657195798505583
So , it is , how can you write in simple term.	7.3275467286214315
Similarly the reactive group on the substrate comes in contact with two catalytic sites and then once the reacting groups gets entangled with the reaction sites on the active sites , the binding is complete and it can exhibit the catalytic function to take place.	9.745378937110134
Now when this monomers undergo anionic polymerization , it will form a species like this.	7.6949534789606
A major application sector is industrial catalysis whereby we replace a chemical catalyst for carrying out a chemical transformation to produce a desired product.	9.482671448287462
Number of approaches has been used to overcome this problem and some enzymes had become easily admissible.	11.255028050735778
The second method is ionic binding where you take a tailored matrix which has a definite charge on the surface and ion exchange resins are the most commonly used matrices.	10.071212683389682
Similarly if it initially binds with ks on to other binding site it can influence the conformational change on the other binding site and it can meet.	10.221565843485681
You close this , compress them and close it and once it cools , you can take out this mold and you can form this shaped article or part so , this is in brief about compression molding.	11.437422289602585
Three major classes of continuous reactors are listed here.	8.57583736022841
I mean , this case the active side is an electron deficient.	10.317317255721612
It s not possible to alter it during reaction and the mobility is lost.	9.077914123075388
Therefore by comparing the two profiles you can see the order of deviation the dead zone and the mixed stream in the reactor has gone into performance.	11.108259991894881
They also play a role in ionization and they also have ionization behavior and their approximate pka values are indicated here.	9.358600382144953
The purpose is if we start with water soluble polymer it will usually not have any cross linking.	9.850545919278298
Now , because typically we use the i0 concentration much lower than the raft concentration , we can use n .	10.056081493176874
One of them oxidizes ah and produces a , where as the other one reduces b using the same co - factor in the reverse direction.	9.73797743452255
We started our discussion on different types of copolymerization.	9.102372218558681
So , this is example of one maldi from pmma polymethylmethaacrolate and you can see these are the peaks from different polymer chains.	8.567120404796878
So , same thing happens in this case because you have a stable radical and this can react with same form rm n dot which again undergoes reversible reaction and form the same logic , which you discuss atip and do the living chain polymerization.	10.225810892586235
You can have from either direction the product formation and they are independent.	10.42098424604731
So , how they come in the contact of the petroleum vapours , or they come in contact with liquid fuel.	9.37365153376659
So , this is what i discussed that delta g m is delta h m minus t deltas delta m enthaply and entropy of fusion , for melting per repeat unit , at equilibrium delta gm zero , so this is zero.	8.656856687976726
Now , the stress strain curve we a talked about and the modulus or the stiffness and the rigidity and your elongation at break , all those parameters or properties can actually depend both on the temperature and the time.	9.342961089043687
Secondly how enzyme under the same background is able to provide much larger reduction in activation energy and provide a more efficient catalyst compared to chemical catalyst.	8.897671615206205
Now , there could be some agents , reagents present , like in case of radical chain polymerizations where this reagent actually can slow down the cationic chain polymerization considerably.	8.607326181943643
So , this is region of metastable region where the composition are stable only for slight change in composition.	7.898119603274789
This is highly electron deficient and this is highly electron rich.	10.307644731686066
We are still talking about idealized the vectors we are only changing the kinetic part.	9.517052601810764
So , the polymers form at the beginning will have low molecular weight , whereas if you increase or when the polymers is producing later on during the reaction , the size increases that we have we have rationalized.	11.491288778206929
Because , chain transfer always breaks the chain and the name we gave for this type of reaction is normal normal chain transfer.	9.027070506520424
Carbon dioxide is led off in the blood stream for the body to take care and the ammonia is taken care by the ion exchange beads and the size approximately of these microcapsules is the order of two hundred to eight hundred microns; very fine microcapsules almost like a tiny set and they are packed and this system is obtainable.	10.648652186872672
It does not come back to the original state , or end there is not any recovery at all , so this is a perfect viscous material.	7.145102589292075
Even transferase have been used in organic medium for sucrose to levan , a polymer and glucose to fructose isomerisation has been shown to shift the equilibrium constant from fifty percent equimolar in the favor of fructose while when we use in the non - aqueous phase.	10.029518939675558
They may not to be an ideal flow dynamics.	10.015747935752842
Substituting the various parameters you get vo = k2 [ e - s ] = k2 [ e ] 0 [ s ] 0 / k - 1 / k1 + s so you get initial rate expression where the initial reaction rate in terms of initial enzyme concentration and substrate concentration are given.	9.690739802099545
The concentration of ea will be given by e0 ( k1 k - 2 k4 a + k1k3 k4 a ) ea =.	8.777746303164411
I want to plot zimm and see what are the information we can get from this.	9.941301824878739
Now , what is n.	6.461553889873351
Now , what happen to k c and k p.	7.460102853698952
The level of s means the level of co - operativity for different enzymes as to how much it deviates from the hyperbolic performance or how much more efficient it is in terms of regulatory behavior.	11.451010569130835
So , for this reason we need to normalize the detector.	7.3073326750661725
The numerator expresses the parameter resembling the rate of reaction and the denominator represents the rate of diffusion and the thiele modulus is an expression of the ratio between the two things.	9.13731910864307
That means when you consider the wet side , on the surface there will be most of the charged groups and most of the non polar side chains will be located inside the three dimensional molecules.	10.983685608006608
Similarly , if we have little bit of moisture present in the medium or if you have water molecules , then this will easily compete with your monomer with oxinium ion and then terminate the or disrupt the reaction immediately.	10.428933347290638
So , they might do react and build molecular weight or they might bide in between and degrade the molecular weight.	8.115055978844135
The products are available from many countries in sweden , or.	11.473152203849157
So , what is done it is still done.	6.541003330403785
So , basically this are the this is , this they would take one from here and one from here and constitute the catalyst , which is generally called ziegler - natta initiator or ziegler - natta catalyst.	8.530865152788824
Now , this depend , these two depends on the thickness of your material , and also lambda , the wavelength of the light , which are used.	8.705703638585296
If we talk about the , this propagation of this butyl lithium reaction , which is , this is butyl lithium , which is common and more important.	10.13413596815366
Now , if i go back the example i gave in the few minutes back , in this case for example , for polyethylene terephthalate this is the unit which is represented in the bracket.	9.9834006404196
This carboxylic group may be different than your amino group or the carboxylic group known.	11.467927077388019
If the polymer is made from 2 different monomers , like in this case adipic acid and its glycol , then molecular of structure will give the average of that , of that.	9.327481153469297
That you can very easily arrive at , if you write down the rate expression for rate of change of enzyme substrate complex for example if you look at your original equation that we discussed e + s x e + p if we consider the original equation that we mentioned earlier , we wrote the rate of change of concentration of x.	9.309210281070232
And if the polymer solvent system is theta solvent for that particular temperature at temperature of experiment , then a 2, a 3 this will all become 0 which means it will be the osmotic pressure by c will be concentration independent.	10.308250296993618
Another important feature of a regulation here besides biosynthesis , is regulation of the enzyme activity itself.	9.939011469949726
So , if you have prior knowledge of your solubility parameter of the polymer and solvent then you can narrow down the polymers , before you go the exact trail.	9.91488571066454
And we will talk about some other , we will start discussion about some other properties in next lecture as well.	7.883034343125126
F2 is the fraction which is in the mixed zone as per this mass balance.	12.187471163249176
If we talking about a plastics , which i used in a car bonnet , then you know that on getting constant heat from outside , the bonnet temperature may go up to 80 degree 90 degree centigrade.	9.929474134914676
Time of adsorption is another parameter which is significant and important because we are talking about the macromolecular adsorption.	10.540688722455435
Typically we do reaction polymerization reaction as well in a isothermal condition you know.	10.07555999965936
Its a flexible conformation.	12.61186475626254
What we mentioned is that we are considering only pathways which have two steps n - 1 steps and any steps which lead to formation of e involving two steps will be considered.	9.316253609601114
So the urea which comes out in the dialysate is hydrolyzed to ammonia; ammonia is absorbed by the ion exchange resin.	9.59900197497531
If you bubble nitrogen through the reagents you can get them free of oxygen.	9.796289104778918
So , the stoichiometry at the reaction side , which is the interface is always maintained at one is to one.	6.972458698561811
So , we consider most of our polymer chains is non - draining , and the polymer coil will be thought as a permeable spherical particles.	9.479391256527347
This is this does not happen for all the sample but , this is shown here to so that , you know all the different terms and related to this tensile testing.	10.67268387441574
I think we will now stop at this point.	5.5136869572937925
And some of the mover fillers , which are now a days used in polymer matrices , polymer formulation are nano - fillers.	10.50052939606989
So , it is a combination of amorphous and crystalline region.	5.8047939126916095
The pressure drop will continuously keep on increasing.	10.599500992016788
That was the only assumption.	10.02358129361131
So , so that should be considered before the polymer is used.	9.497620180892241
For example , when a patient goes through a open heart surgery , the blood of the patient s body is taken out and by help of external machine called oxygenator , which act basically as lungs and heart.	9.979128372199408
Now , doing that , what we what we consider that , this polymer molecules are volume less , we are why i am drawing this , they are several intersections , if i draw like this steps vectors like this , these are the steps random of if the polymer takes.	12.668421232227523
So basically you plot , you make different solution with different concentration and plot; with this you get the intrinsic viscosity.	9.934299330976907
We will cover the remaining parts of the chain copolymerization discussion we are having.	9.694402859411364
So if i place third here , i can place third here; i can place here , i can place here , i can place here.	7.476525886373403
Consider three different functional groups.	9.476347912116898
So therefore if particle size is reduced you get an advantage that the fraction of the total particle which is receiving the substrate increases coming to one when the particle size is too small and usually in most cases as per the experimental experiences that a particle size about thirty microns in most cases of the biochemical reactions has been considered to give you an effectiveness factor of one.	10.31881930650992
So , if the length of the branch is higher than the entanglement molecular weight , then you call that as a long chain branch , how you characterize or define the sort of gives the parameter , describe the branching; obviously , the branched for same given molecular weight , if you have same molecular weight , because the branches the size , radius of gyration will be lower as you can expect.	10.576885117505052
So , which also means that as the reaction progress , both the concentration of monomer and the initiator comes down; which means , as the reaction progress with time , the rate of polymerization also comes down.	8.625484880653431
The specificity also is the result of the conformation of active site.	8.677464710042043
Now , the two other things are thermal management because polymerization reactions are exothermic.	8.689094500055761
So , you divide that and get this as another expression for the poly habrid expression , where this gibbs free energy of mixing takes place in terms of first segment of the polymer molecule.	9.160193986971231
We will talk about the full forms , time; and i planned to just give you examples of commercial polymers , which are made use of this radical polymerization technique and then , we will conclude this module of radical chain polymerization at the end by giving you a brief summary of what we have learnt in radical chain polymerization.	9.408802078210693
If you look at the slope of reciprocal plot slope is slope = km / vm ( 1 + i / ki ) = km / vm . ki . i + km / vm if you get a secondary plot where you plot the value of slope , obtained from the primary double reciprocal plot , as a function of inhibitor concentration you will again end up in a straight line with the slope of km / vm . ki.	7.5561235493763075
As you know , these would have higher reactivity and higher reaction compared to these and this has exothermic reaction.	9.1676331978959
Crystalline polymers or semi - crystalline polymer give you a higher density to amorphous polymers.	11.100478188054753
So , we will spend little time on these examples and if you want , you can get more information of any text book or some other literature.	10.593707510259318
So , here you can exactly get the difference in the signals with a molecular weight of the repeating unit.	7.193427788569767
So , these is one example of making copolymers in step by step polymerization method you take say a by functional monomers a b type.	8.955014022237204
Now , what would be the chain good transfer agent which can easy participate in chain transfer reactions and those does molecules like s s n thiol , now containing s s n thiol.	8.919972412127189
In the presence of inhibitor their activity will be decreased but once you remove it physically , the original activity of the enzyme is recovered.	10.518075529885559
You know reactivity coupled with the reactivity if some monomers is diffusing first at the interface it will react faster.	10.043825566307962
While we discussed reaction rate theory we noted that collision of the molecule is a pre requisite for reaction to take place.	8.978258960427137
Now , typically this aromatic halides are not very reactive towards a nucleophilic substitution reaction , but because you have a strong electron withdrawing group present here co or co 2, co or so 2 this becomes more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution.	9.63632145596728
X . s0 is the total product formed and tau is the space time per unit time , the amount of product formed per unit time.	10.305158759722058
And also for ideal solution , it is only the combinatorial entropy which contributes to the gibbs free energy change for the mixing.	9.663080792831616
So , n x is the number multiplied by x which is the number of structural unit present in one molecule.	6.216792354015079
As you know earlier , that is n 0 by n.	9.045968204696914
In the case of product inhibition the reaction rate is given by v = k2e0 1 + km / s ( 1 + p / k'p ) k'p is the inhibition constant which is the competitive inhibitor of the reaction.	8.23852823850549
So you can feed the substrate either from the top or the bottom and take out another stream.	9.55598349989054
Basically it amounts to looking at the reaction kinetics.	10.429124067843386
These , you know that the property or the value of this colligative properties will depend upon the number of solid molecules.	12.04653813274963
That means we develop a mass balance equation for a particular reactor , apply the reaction kinetics and analyze the equation and get the final reactor performance equation interms of tow verses the fractional conversion or the remaining substrate concentration in the reactor.	9.270108655179124
A few case studies i like to illustrate some of the earlier issues with respective to specific cases and ultimately i think i like to take up enzyme based sensors.	11.570116771348147
Unlike most of the chemical reactions you will notice that this represents a case where the order of reaction changes the substrate concentration.	11.10485972826063
So , theta is t by psi.	9.108977622912015
So , freely rotating chain , we can get this expression.	7.034211630101957
And then i will talk about kinetics of cationic chain polymerization and then energetics of cationic chain polymerization.	6.133356770670626
Similarly , you can find this is whether blocks , that the two block in a block polymer , and miscible or partially miscible , or completely immiscible.	10.430661012098943
Let us discuss the maldi matrix assisted laser desorption ionization.	8.243642248192556
You can multiply it both side by and convert it to; n 1 is the number of molecules solvent molecules and small n 1 lower case n is your number of moles solvent , number of moles of solvent.	9.236566377067538
You have to make sure of some other conditions.	7.245428449777922
That is p e m .	8.51234809004038
Now , we will only see the mechanism of polymerization.	5.948119795964725
On the other hand if this height required is reasonably high then you forget about biochemical reactions and design the reactor based on diffusional requirements based on the mass transfer coefficients.	9.359051194595637
So , the most of the surfactant molecules are present as or present in , micelles , and micelles if you are not aware micelles are aggregation of surfactants which because it has surfactant has about hydrophobic and hydrophilic components by forming micelles.	9.95379370339767
It is not possible because both the sides , you have a di acid , di caboxly acid , both the side you have a two carboxyl acid or di - hydroxyl compound and both the side , two hydroxyl acid group.	9.921587967991332
In extreme case , if r 1 is very high and r 2 is very , very low , then the tendency would be to make consecutive homo polymers because this is very high.	9.917594953476891
So , the size of this monomer is becoming smaller and smaller , and will vanish at the end of stage ii , so at the stage ii you have only this particles , no surfactant , free surfactant micelles , neither you have free droplets.	9.282128952131158
So if you go back , and look at these factors we discussed in last lecture.	7.26785155037586
If you consider that this regime is the thin film then from the bulk there might be a linear substrate gradient across the thin film and the concentration might drop at the surface and from the surface to the interior of the particle that means to center of the particle there might be again a gradient as a result of biochemical reaction.	8.937758165942011
So , gpc with tripple detector ri plus viscosity plus ls light scattering , we get molecular weight no standard require you can get absolute molecular weight.	9.92328539147761
Because , it is making high polymer high molecular weight polymer that means it is undergoing more times of propagating reaction than a terminating reaction or a transfer reaction which means probability is close to .	9.570853470965503
So , the reaction the chances of reacting of this two species is low , the chances of this species reacting with this species is low.	8.170422779326586
So , these are the corresponding temperature and in those system , you will get a upper critical solution temperature.	6.639025707424119
There will be no effective binding taking place and that means the secondary step will be ruled out.	9.59579799321419
So , r 1, r 2 will be given by if we can multiply these two given by exponential minus e 1 minus e 2 square.	8.19630114222165
They did for cholinesterase which was entrapped in a starch matrix and it was used for continuous detection of anti - cholinesterase.	10.462495841700632
On the other hand at high substrate concentration , when.	6.239832435976138
So , a radical a kinetic chain or a propagating radical can undergo three reaction it can again reactive with the monomer and propagate , it can terminate , it can transfer.	10.536819390891702
We will start giving that example of the side reactions in case of the polar monomers like methyl methaculate or or methyl vinyl or methyl ketones where the side reactions , the molecular build up is difficult.	10.016498636595061
If the partitioning creates unfavorable conditions for the reaction then it will not be more than one.	9.710851126984705
If i had this is 0 percent any external molecule there is no external molecule in this case , if it is 0 percent 0.1 percent benzoquinone , benzoquinone this is benzoquinone.	10.631055651925323
The other substrate concentration will influence the magnitude of kappm in the case of a bi - substrate reaction whereas in the case of a single substrate reaction the km value was almost analogous under the assumption that the term turn over number that is k2 term is not very , very small.	9.00226395498855
When the substrates are bound on the active site the effective local concentration of the two reactants in the active site will also be much larger than the concentration in the free solution.	10.779857665484592
And , there are several types of anti , primary anti oxidants : one is hindered phenols; they basically terminate the proxy radicals , as i just mentioned.	10.016356330216128
The enzyme carboxylase catalyses the reaction.	6.808948648140116
Let us take an example.	4.813064321504609
So , those entropies will not change.	7.322151699124531
When you talk of ei that is the activity of immobilized enzyme you are measuring in terms of the activity only.	11.701263276643214
The energy stored in the material , and if we in the chemical bonds , and then if you release that stress , it will come back to the original state.	7.947083147018621
F is one.	9.486514518212184
Now , from these two equations , we have seen in the last class itself that and it is very difficult to build a high molecular weight , high value of x n bar for a self catalyzed reaction and that is the reason in most cases , in a most industrial polymerization has taken place in presence of a catalyst which is added from outside the system.	8.77222045567778
For example , if you have say during a polyester formation , if you have something like this , there is one more very common side reaction is happens is by beta elimination reaction.	9.239883469684553
There is no significant heat of reaction , isothermal operation.	8.52784412364892
And of course , as the pi bonds you know , the conjugation pi bonds , the more the conjugation the higher is the absorption , so i following the conjugate sequence of pi bonds , we can follow the conversion of polyacrylonitrile fiber into carbon fibers.	10.396759385466996
For example , titania alumina trihydrate , they when in a in a fire situation , it releases water around 200 degree centigrade , which basically inhibits the combustion process.	9.11762457677799
Thats why im saying first and third are similar but the enzyme transfers phosporyl group on to the third carbon atom.	10.558257819311061
For all practical purposes by rapid mixing techniques people have been able to analyze and determine the value of k - 1, k1 and k2 a reasonable value.	9.432233312674011
Also in many of the critical situations where the assumptions of the enzyme catalyzed reactions were not valid strictly under certain set of condition the michaelis menten kinetics could be considered to be applicable.	11.13796853600538
And if we can find out this , we will be able to determine what is the extent of isotacticity , and syndiotacticity in the polymer.	9.46322537792556
So , actually the deformation or the strain happen in a tensile way , in a longitudinal way , uniaxial if this uniaxial to . .. . . so , the only difference between this and a tensile stress strain test that , here the strain is applied or the stress is applied much higher rate.	9.59255458276347
So one in the second means m 1, two is the second means m 2 and so on.	7.8760863597319375
Now polymer also show optical activity if they are a optically active conformation.	11.017922552242522
The major characteristic feature of the continuous stirred tank reactor often denoted as cstr is that the contents of the reactor are perfectly mixed or the system is totally homogeneous.	10.820466884140698
Now , each of these are the number of functional groups unreacted.	9.92336414720163
So , there are actually three restrictions , bond angle restriction , short range restriction , restriction which is coming from the single bond rotational restriction , and there is also long range steric interaction , and excluded volume effect which will , which we will encounter 1 by 1 and see how the dimension or the size of the polymer changes , this should be size not shape.	9.450259751839448
So , you will have a drift in drift in monomer composition with time.	6.801380642733989
And at t m where the crystallite melts , which leads to a viscous state.	9.836070430640198
The deae cellulose also is a very stable carrier which can be regenerated although no such commercial process is operational in the case of glucoamylase mainly because of the process economics.	12.753043101703321
So , that is the reason you get this type of confirmation most of the times.	7.833376638722924
But still , because one of the monomers might have volatile in excess than other , which will imbalance your stoichiometric ratio and which will definitely going to decrease your final molecular weight.	10.764549449872225
M v is always lower than m w , but it is very close within 10 to 20 percent.	9.19068100919854
In the case of a classical enzyme catalyzed system we have 1 / v vs 1 / s.	7.959459733967615
Iu / m2 also is a feasible parameter that we can define.	14.88597817247461
Similarly , if it is stiff then , you cannot deform it you know , you cannot strain it much longer which means , the elongational break for a stiff polymer is low.	10.264923526415652
So the michaelis menten kinetics need to be extended to develop a rate expression which takes into account steady state with respect to one of the intermediates and analyze it in analogy to develop a lump parameter for defining the turn over number.	9.559194734726441
Now , this two can be polymerized to give you a poly styrene co mma , this is a copolymer of poly styrene and methyl methacrylate.	9.069906219670601
So by any means if the enzyme can either reduce the enthalpic contribution to the free energy of activation or entropic contribution , the net result will be a catalytic function.	10.027555003709535
So denser the coil volume , the smaller the intrinsic viscosity as we have been discussing earlier that if the coil becomes more denser , then smaller is the size and smaller is the intrinsic viscosity for the same molecular weight.	10.053330331721723
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
And , all this reactions happen between the functional groups; so , polyester case , reaction between oh and cooh.	9.997726933231341
We talk about termination step now.	9.14767154371249
Now , these are very high energy.	6.809612932275729
A student should know are expected to know the molecular distribution and polydispersity index in a step polymerization and we should also know that the for any high molecular step polymer the pdi should be close to 2 or as a matter of close to .	9.701577360372069
And then we said that if we plot this expression.	7.385640887985703
There is maximum and this maximum around comes above the x in bar number of average.	9.265505001160221
Salting in and salting out both are feasible and of course the phenomena or the physical interactions are just opposite.	12.655568809248331
Another way of classifying the carriers will be on the basis of chemical nature.	8.261487808461933
So , in any polymerization reaction , you at the end of the reaction , you have a distribution which content similar molecular.	7.782099427339543
So the performance will be almost identical to that of a batch reactor excepting with the difference that the reaction time here is replaced by the space time and the reactor performance therefore on the same lines you can write as s0x k m ln ( 1 - x ) = k 2e0 e.	8.607793036308237
For unknown sample , then how do you determine the viscosity average molecular weight.	9.273984153214593
But the advantage is that the ultimate mixture of glucose and fructose is used as the product.	7.249826326510333
You can disperse the monomers in aqueous phase and do the polymerization , you call this suspension polymerization.	9.715488888661234
This summation for all x s should give you n 0 total numbers of molecule and n x by n .	10.262608009557706
But even on the practical aspect probably from the industrial aspect also effector molecules are very important because in large number of drugs and the preservatives that are used commercially they basically work on the principle of modulating the enzyme reaction rate.	9.796501074791209
That means that this bond is already now partially broken and if this molecule then goes to transition state the energy of activation required will be much less.	9.776262254891448
But only thing is that this esi complex once formed is catalytically inactive and does not lead to product formation.	9.499402451536477
For a soluble enzyme you cannot use a plug flow reactor.	6.920364270830864
We plot k c by delta r theta as we said that this term is a function of both theta and concentration , we combine these two with a constant term this is arbitrarily chosen constant.	9.73328151933964
Now we will try to apply the same lattice theory to find out the gibbs free energy of mixing for the polymer solvent mixture or a solution of a polymer in a solvent.	7.08064729060712
Now , in practical sense , in most of the cases , you know exclusively almost every cases , when you synthesize a polymer , you get head or tail , head to tail polymers and you rarely get unless you make specific arrangement to make such a polymer , you don t get head to head polymers.	9.65121226833894
And obviously , here that the uv visible absorption spectra for the monomers , and for the peaks of the monomers and the polymers will be different , so we can follow the monomer peaks , and to find out the conversion during the polymerization.	9.473312353582783
So , you can say that if i stop the reaction and we have this reaction kinetics , how the p varies with time.	8.498814760528374
Now that was the understanding and they also very clearly understood at that time that both substrate as well as the active site on the enzyme molecule have rigid structures.	9.776111241295014
Then look at the effect of the inhibitor concentration on km or vm or both of the reaction.	9.660152012869805
They could also be conjugated proteins.	10.016544229682406
It is almost close to hundred percent polymers and you have the additives or fillers , which basically are the property enhancer or stabilizers or color and dye.	10.345685611233142
Porous silica beads were taken and the enzyme was adsorbed on to that and the cost of the product is not very high so that one can afford this immobilization method; even if the operational stability is not very high it doesn t matter.	9.556793400990735
The concentration of enzyme is much , much smaller than either a or b.	6.878707817596716
Two cystein residues oxidize to give s - s bond and that can come at different points in the chain.	9.947078948726737
Now , the practical part how the monomers are usually polymerized in a in a industry scenario or in the lab.	8.869306967552582
These are the again represented in examples of some light stabilizers , commonly used in polymers.	8.703255823605838
So , you get an alternate copolymer at the beginning.	5.366759441679347
The change in the optimum temperature is a result of temperature gradient across the bulk and the enzyme particle and this is very prominent when you talk of gel entrapped enzyme preparation.	10.926142525032267
So , with this and this , you can take this; a new constant; put this.	8.634835095388567
It is more isotactic , rather than syndiotactic.	10.228352457855749
So , again i write mole fraction of x mar is given by 1 minus p p to the power x minus .	6.901175889411472
So , we need calibration and calibration is typically done.	6.663137073146386
So , how we will look at , how the weight fraction is distributed.	9.210870987258192
So , there is a guide line for trouble shooting , now you must be capturing the condensate in a trap will distilling of the condensate byproduct you must be you know must be collecting that in a trap.	9.96875182439002
In the case of amino acids , they vary in terms of their various properties particularly ionic nature , their hydrophobic nature and their size.	8.332559897188185
Then , we started our discussion on flory - huggins theory on polymer solution.	7.25504562543701
It is a dispersion which is cast into a thin film.	8.699147900069432
So , that , this is clear that , inspite of they having 2 step in the initiation process , we are taking the slower step which is basically the rate determining step for the initiation process.	9.853770332399698
These are the chains which are shown in the dotted lines and indicate the cross linkages which are vertical to the plane of the paper so the three dimensional network is formed and enzyme molecules are entrapped within the interstitial spaces which are created by the cross linkages that are maintained and you get a smooth solid block in the form of a gel.	9.165761534436031
So , we can write delta s m minus r v phi .	7.654634510031454
One is that the patient after sometime fails to respond to dialysis , if the concentration goes very high the volume of the dialysate required is very large.	9.680731898779584
There is other type of polymers which are also synthesized from two different monomers.	8.96534074863773
Last feature is synthetic enzymes in molecular imprinting.	13.697569824484077
One of the unique features of the enzymes catalytic function is their specificity.	8.922903914370789
These are the two parameters which today we understand as ph and the temperature.	7.186250307275509
They can regenerate the carrier as and when the enzyme activity comes down; even they can dissolve; they can re - adsorb it and the carrier is fairly sturdy and it doesn t get degenerated.	11.252298138520489
So , these are the reason , why we need all this numbers , or the values of all this molecular weights , not only a single molecular weight , and also the distribution.	8.952271496922455
So , this condition will satisfy that the carbon ion chain end and the lithium counter ion are tightly bound , strongly bound each other.	8.082560464710578
In most cases it is true and that is why even the dissociation constant concept is feasible.	9.01041801677553
So , it cannot come off.	6.814053246286991
What did the commercial way of synthesis or the most practiced the synthetic process of making polyester or poly ethylene terephthalicin.	11.250571685858196
But if you compare under the same conditions the enzyme as a catalyst will provide you much more efficient system and one should look at how the enzyme provides this kind of efficiency compared to a chemical catalyst because the ultimate goal in both cases is the same , to reduce the energy of activation.	9.173880328975201
That in case , of step growth polymerization step growth polymerization the polymer is considered the entire mass.	12.494385462493195
We determine by some experimental method or an analytical method or an empirical equation the magnitude of the mass transfer coefficient and the magnitude of mass transfer coefficient will give you the magnitude of the concentration gradient and so another alternative route to estimation of mass transfer coefficient has been from empirical relationship what we call as jd factor.	9.831746926432249
For example we have , a monomer like this , it could be a aldehyde group.	6.797433130199196
So d s t stands for differential scanning calorimetory , and differential d t a stands for differential thermal analysis.	9.366272433841589
He also proposed that this substrate concentration at which the reaction rate reaches half the vm value which is the dissociation constant also has direct implication with the affinity of enzyme to substrate.	9.903892504824762
Simply , if you are starting with n 0 of monomers and then finally , you have present , you are remain with n mono n chains , then each chain will have n 0 by n structure units; simple.	11.626510609524228
For example this is the material column and you feed the sample through a pump and you have a small heat exchanger which maintains in a very controlled range the inlet temperature and the outlet temperature is monitored by a thermister which is installed at the outlet end and this is connected to measurement circuit and measures the impedance.	11.816688535049373
So , which we can get some idea about tga , fragmentation happen during heating or as we have seen that some time additives are used during polymer formulation , so if they are , on heating if there is some loss , thermal loss of those additives , that can be also found out.	10.4422671962398
Whenever we change k and a for a different polymer; obviously , we get a new set of calibration.	11.60459547797748
To illustrate the procedure followed i chose this reaction mechanism.	8.985121497381305
So , it , when it reacts with , say , some organic molecule , it can form radical cat ion and eject a electron; and this radical cat ion can dissociate into radical and a cat ion , which can capture this electron and form another radical.	9.983027506462332
So , the reaction rate also comes down , and till the reaction is over , so that is stage iii , stage iii gets completed when this reactions gets completed.	9.441213066691422
And if you have different shape dye like sheets , you can form sheets or pipes here itself or if you want to use this material for for further injection molding or some other molding , still you can cut into granules in small pieces and make them as a granules.	10.574118935025288
Common tangency points are the spinodal points and inflection sorry common tangency points or binodal points and inflection points are spinodal points.	10.61290745820307
Another analytical device based on immobilized enzyme is enzyme thermisters.	12.23352755997719
This molecule can hide the hydrophobic parts from aqueous environment , and they form aggregates , and typically this aggregate are of size of 2 to 10 nanometer.	11.11302881524645
Even if you are producing an radical which is as good as death death chain , because it is not talking part in initiation of a mu chain.	10.175012570535493
Now , as this particles form more and more , the this requires more and more surfactant molecules to get stabilized , which will be supplied by the micelle , which are not taking part in polymerization reaction or the inactive micelles.	10.38139033081044
Quantity of enzyme which can exhibit this kind of a rate , initial rate is termed as one international unit.	11.3136667875904
That means the molecular weight is more compared to the molecular weights which were getting generated before.	10.305074207120077
A very broad based method which involves a number of non - specific , multivariant , reversible interactions between the enzyme and the carrier at mild conditions.	9.511067918655641
So , in this case , molecular of structure unit is twice the molecular of repeat unit; this is the repeat unit , and this is the structure unit.	7.736133590089873
Now v h is the volume of the particle.	6.650120460499646
Then , we got the entropy of the mixture from the boltzmann expression and then , we deduce or deducted the entropies of the polymer molecules , pure polymer molecules and the solvent molecules to reach the value for the entropy of mixing for polymer solvent system or polymer solution.	9.30654618845669
Where in case of crystalline state , solid state , we have long - range order; in case of liquid state we have short - range order and in gaseous state we do not have any order.	10.627462982766096
These are the basic assumptions which define our ideal enzyme reactor and the reactor design parameters.	9.334514995931475
But the only difference will be that the reaction conditions that has to be employed , when i say reactions conditions , i am referring to the concentration of the gluteraldehyde , the ratio of gluteraldehyde to that of protein , the time of reaction and the temperature of reaction will vary in the case of two reactions.	10.222492606464007
So , you must have , this you keep in mind , when you design additives for step growth polymers.	8.068365573762923
F here is defined as thiele modulus in general which is defined as a lump parameter like this which is f = l . [ ktrue . ssm - 1 / de ] 1 / 2 ktrue is the reaction kinetic constant in the absence of any pore diffusional effects that means in the surface or in the bulk.	9.11713428305471
Sometimes giving the development of the catalyst this titanium trichloride or tetrachloride , they are used along with a support like say magnesium chloride , where this titanium compound is either coherently bonded or they are occupied a crystal position in the lattice of the magnesium chloride support.	11.348548123986282
And we just started giving examples , which chain transfer with monomeric species and what we will do.	8.95256157523728
So , what are the things we can get.	6.715180290961055
At the end of gpc experiment , we get a detector response and with the illusion volume.	8.748076334528239
This is the mole fraction for solvent , this is for solute , this is number of moles for solvent , then this is number of moles for the solute.	10.609043150045466
So for a chain , the more is the contribution from ends , the more is the free volume; hence the t g is slower.	8.967501588542886
Let us take particular example of methyl methacrylate.	6.101975565833153
This delta t is the temperature difference from the final to initial.	12.044129017292171
Glucose isomerase , some of the native enzymes have a ph optimum of about 7.5 - 8, alkaline.	12.525345666111289
So , each polymer chain how many per polymer chain.	6.04136731721053
Just like an activator molecule , here also the km gets modified to a new value 1 + i / ki and therefore as the concentration of i increases the value of km also increases and the affinity decreases for the substrate.	9.152609365821863
So , we talked about a different , the most common rate expression for rate of polymerization; whether it is , it has initiated by thermal initiator or redox initiator or by photo chemical initiation , these are the most common root of initiating a radical polymerization.	9.0755600000567
These enzyme sample activity must depend upon the effect of enzyme concentration on the reaction velocity and we use such a parameter particularly when we plot the concentration of enzyme on the reaction velocity.	11.627459320653779
That means the movement of particle increases and the tendency is for desorbing rather than adsorption.	8.805769939915216
The formation of transition state starting from a and b can be considered as a simple chemical equilibrium process.	8.92470404810522
The data points shown here are experimental data with different particle sizes say for example from hundred twenty microns to thousand microns.	11.340938719090493
Some of the factors which in addition to the earlier components of an immobilized enzyme process which have emerged by virtue of experience in various processes are also like this.	8.764079029498253
He gave an example that the interaction between the substrate and the enzyme is some thing like a hand and the woolen glove.	9.870610210046165
So , basically to form miscible blend , the molecular weight has to be low , which is not a practical so , polymers which having high molecular weight , mixing is always governed by entropy of mixing.	10.940579081849181
So what does mean that not only , a require co polymers for improved teramid properties.	9.5382546514955
For example roughly about two fold increase causes 19.3 grams per liter to 31.6, a very significant increase in km value.	8.513422111938768
And if you have two different group in side then you can make a copolymer , but this has not very regularly used method from making copolymer , if you the practiced methods are normally if you say , if you are making a polyester , if you have say ch 2 ch 2 oh ethylene glycol.	10.490501567960525
If you consider this as a pure monomer , if you fix this concentration pure monomer as this goes down t c goes down.	8.478004405127114
Obviously , they will prefer because r is up.	9.765934988577662
Now , in this case you have a b or if you have here a that means , in the polymers you can have the two functional groups at the end.	9.438182366999712
We have synthesized the polymer and characterized; now we have to give or you to make a polymer in a different shape , which is the shape of the final applications of that polymers.	10.300926057162606
You wear a woolen glove.	11.728643307281986
You also have another step; you know another possible step like , transfer , reactions which we will discuss when it is necessary.	10.96802691437889
So , if there were no side reaction , the amount of radicals it was generating; now , it has reduced because this so many side reaction.	9.047745779017427
It can have linear chains like this.	6.466299909162745
That means the volume of the reactor occupied by the enzyme preparation is negligible compared to the total reactor volume whereas in the case of a packed bed a significant proportion of the reactor is occupied by the enzyme preparation.	7.903674917747383
Second is uniform enzyme distribution.	10.33768921938673
Alter centrifugation would depend upon m z.	13.886288394237516
I presume that you understand what ultra filtration cell is.	10.945034687426359
Alternatively if you take an immobilized enzyme preparation to be very lean loading that means the loading is very low and the catalyst is not very reactive or alternatively the enzyme.	11.604673085824317
If we know the individual uv visible spectra , absorption spectra for polybutadiene , and polystyrene homopolymer , then from there we can easily get the composition of polybutadiene - co - styrene.	9.509397760803406
This also has the advantage of almost well scattered or data points that can be easily used.	10.069062357383462
So , you name it ethylene terephthalate and because it is a polymer so you are writing this poly ethylene terephthalate.	8.518107572691404
When we talk about the enzyme , structure and functional aspects , we are missing one thing that whatever studies have been made in those aspects they have been made after isolating the enzyme from a cell.	10.293163291564545
So , the example we have seen in this page , and in this page , confirms the understanding that if we increase the back bone stiffness , the t m goes up.	7.379684057805879
The second part which is demonstrated is the catalytic function which is given by k2, the turn over number.	8.267831348919023
The intermediate regime is that where km and s0 are of comparable value.	10.401560726404044
A very , very small quantity and then the rate expression will turn up into the michaelis menten kinetics.	7.710099727945663
If we know the reaction , the values of delta h p and delta s p , now what is delta s p sign.	11.620797757037973
Number of initiator molecules can be used.	9.699646280205776
Now , step growth polymerization can be classified in or grouped into types - one is , where you have polymerization done from single monomer having 2 different functional group; so , i write a b gives you this; for example , i can write , general reaction.	10.136820994770483
They can be accounted in while we consider the reactor performance.	7.415344410720635
You can justify this drop in molecular weight with increase in temperature and increasing rate of polymerization.	7.113177564453881
It does not influence the k2 value , the turn over number , because as we know vm = k2.e 0 here e0, in the presence of non - competitive inhibitor , corresponds to that fraction of total enzyme which is in the form of es.	8.292336467583949
You can further simplify this by multiplying this by k1, k.	10.770652051203431
Now again , this is molecular of structure units , if this is , this is synthesis from two different monomer in this case adipic acid and ethylene glycol.	10.72894849903687
If you consider from 0.8 to 0.99, the ratio is still higher and the same relationship will also hold good for space time.	8.66149396183982
The use over a long period of time may involve many features which might expose the whole material to many features which may lead to microbial degradation , thermal degradation or mechanical degradation and the carrier should be resistant to them.	9.494861161944645
For each binding of the substrate to a binding site the affinity reduces by a factor let us say a , as interaction factor.	10.203250350134656
And in this lecture we will continue our discussion on polymer stereochemistry and coordination polymers , which we began in the last lecture.	4.9395325534765275
So , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, .	10.945947417341996
You can get the individual rate constant in the form of the four parameters that we talked about vm , k a , ka and kb which represents the kinetic parameters.	8.749395000944196
If you want to increase the sensitivity you can decrease the lambda , because the i theta is proportional to 1 over lambda .	10.137129518678352
So , crystalline regions are embedded with or embedded in these amorphous regions , which are not crystalline.	9.943333560742492
This will be higher from any other because he was talking about this is a gas phase reaction.	10.32097446366773
But just for this course i am just giving you a over view of this different step polymer and just generic method of synthesizing this.	10.414372447496897
No . this f2 is the fraction of total volume which is stagnant.	10.71350287567849
One is intrinsic parameters which are the same as that of soluble enzyme which means no partitioning in a soluble system , no mass transfer limitations; the sole parameter is the reaction rate and they are called the intrinsic parameters.	10.521950661047411
One example , the common example is bht , butyl hydroxotolovine; structure is shown here; they are used in this type of anti , primary anti oxidants are used very much for styrenics , vinyls , and elastomers.	10.242785844510449
Let us say it reaches up to here.	8.297301119389797
Now , what is degrees of polymers.	7.0289108887591185
Yes . exactly what we are assuming here is that there is no reaction within the pores of the particle.	8.016411786436349
Lysozyme is an enzyme which breaks down bacterial polysaccharide by virtue of acid base catalysis predominantly.	13.120556675304487
Now , if we can make the polymer surface such that , this absorption of protein can be prevented or minimized.	9.067465156581804
So , if i write these steps r p 1, r p 2, r p n , and so on.	6.352509529811379
And , if we consider only the case of thermal initiator , then nu is equal to r p by r i , k p m.	10.490569011393493
A large number of rate constants might be involved depending on the number of reaction sequence steps and substrate and product and other chemical species if involved.	9.690323955848186
If the initiator concentration increases , then r p goes up , rate of polymerization goes up , but x n bar or the molecular weight comes down.	8.086976945882858
So , that will again reduce the molecular weight build up.	6.867797310965901
There is no accumulation of any species in the system and therefore one can write k 2e0s v = d ( s0 - s ) = k m + s d is the term here what we understand as dilution rate or f / v or in other words v / f is the resistance time , inverse of space time.	8.985896131926356
Now , let us talk about shape first.	4.896306488974251
This is the plot , the weight fraction as you can see from this distribution.	8.470878117691008
The report may take two hour.	12.982789543639655
Now , what is the reaction in a in a in a basically copolymerization or radical reaction.	7.206684966866658
Why , cannot we just say m n.	10.865044792079377
Acetone 20.3 is basically this polycarbonate becomes soil it s not very good solvent for polycarbonate , but it is it is also a very non solvent either.	11.350515000770363
The situation in the case of different substrates which can have different functional groups can be much simpler.	10.248277296331558
When you consider the strain or the distortion of the substrate molecule before it can go into the active site for binding purposes , if the desired bond which has to be broken during the reaction is partially strained or distorted then part of the job is already done.	11.048817984167462
Just to recall our earlier discussion on the previous day we mentioned that the energy of activation e * can be broken down into two components that is your enthalpy contribution as well as entropic contribution.	9.879434219251621
Right at this stage itself the product will be formed which is x and this will be ea and this is k.	13.058199172269621
So , this is absolute technique.	6.242784480288669
Now star could be radical , cations or anion , so this is valid , this terminal model is valid for any initiation process.	9.853267059370193
In this case , the new monomer is getting inserted in the titanium alkyl bond and regenerating the vacant d - orbital.	6.101165161427346
So , this is one example , we just discussed about pvc.	7.883253956754474
Now , look at this number k d is very small where k p is much higher compare to k d.	9.47618027502678
It may be noted that , this absorbed light can be reemitted , but that reemitted light is always less , or at best equal compared to the amount of absorbed light.	11.525992349566373
You cannot reach high molecular weight.	7.030239139130702
It can absorb water from the atmosphere and form a layer of water molecules , which form path ways for dissipating the static charges.	10.723707148766726
So , the molecular weight of structure unit; in this case average , because 2 are different.	8.122091236197848
This rate of polymerization r p.	9.869371565630066
If similar forces are involved they can also act as much better catalyst theoretically.	11.469422211420827
Now , if this has to spontaneously phase separate to any of the other two compositions , say this composition and this composition two point.	7.955995790012716
Physically , each i 0 was forming one radical and that radical was participating in a propagating chain.	10.476848345887253
Now , you have to make the total of these total of this diol with the ratio of this thing is close to one is to one.	7.154714777559035
During the reaction if some molecules oligomer are forming , which are say , precipitate out of the solution , if you are doing the reaction in a solution , if the oligomer precipitate out , then the functional groups are not available to reaction.	12.431550121090273
T = q.	11.259021454265685
Optimum temperature has also been attributed to conformational changes particularly in the case of adsorbed enzyme preparation or covalently coupled preparations where there is no likelihood of any temperature or you can even notice the temperature changes in the case of a non - porous matrix where all the enzyme is just immobilized on the surface of the matrix.	9.366834646939726
A number of reactor systems are available.	8.767381876996811
Now , because the radical are entering into this micelles or the particles randomly , the probability that at any point of time the probability that any point of time a particle have a 1 or 0 radical is same , you understand that can it can have either 1 radical or a 0 radical , it cannot have more than 1 radical.	9.03240238460233
Now , if you cool this or reduce the temperature of this polymer melt , obviously this viscosity goes up and the polymers start flowing less.	9.227136958095556
We will start from there in the next lecture.	4.503932342185865
This is actually having higher 290 kilo joule per mol , but because of this nitrogen generation , this molecule , this dissociation also becomes feasible , or very much feasible at normal reaction temperature.	9.20431534851325
In this case we got , this rate is lower than chain polymerization , rate of polymerization come down.	8.528878362744328
You can look at the homopolymerization rate of m 1 and m 2, and from that you can have idea about the homopolymerization , but the homopolymerization data , homopolymerization rate data , actually has very little significance or resiblance with the rate of consumption , or rate of reaction of a monomer during a copolymerization reaction , which means that , if a monomer , the rate at which a monomer; say m 1 undergo homopolymerization , that could be quite different , when you have m 2 in the reaction medium.	10.018886562110952
The two types of diffusion , we will subsequently see their quantitative analysis in relation to the biochemical reaction but we shall understand that these two processes will put you four additional resistances over and above the biochemical reaction.	9.685208728516312
So , we can simply write the weight fraction d w of the polymer which eluted between v e and v e plus d v e; we can consider the sample this slice which is very infinitesimal slice.	8.15123031570873
But there will be always some free monomer remaining , which is equal to the free monomer concentration at equilibrium for that particular temperature.	10.255993940549468
This gradient will depend on the thickness of the boundary layer and you can minimize this by increasing a very high agitation speed in the stirred reactor or increase a very high linear flow velocity in a continuous reactor.	9.238274716825904
We know the crystal; the molecules are arranged in a definite order.	8.656219175685706
It will determine the lewis acidity and for same , same metal is the oxidation state increases , the lewis acidity increases and also the lewis acidity.	11.158914646137495
One of the important aspects is that unlike synthetic macromolecules which we are familiar in our day to day life say polythene or styrene they are all linear chain molecules , long linear chain molecules , hydrocarbon residue of monomers.	8.979055079127406
So if the feed is added at the flow rate of f let us say litres or moles per unit time , what ever unit you follow , the volume remains the constant.	10.232939903413635
And obviously , depends on the distance between the object viewed and the sample , and there is , if there is light absorption in scattering visibly , clarity will be lost.	9.686776630373927
If this is known if k h is known , then obviously you can determine intrinsic viscosity by plotting eta s p by c versus c till the c is very dilute; you know c should not be very high.	8.917005489789135
So , what will be del h mixture.	6.592116695470233
The second substrate has to interact with the binary complex before the first product can arrive at but the stable intermediates are only ea and ey.	10.17003617250157
The two parameters which are very important to control here is the absence of oxygen.	10.356916376777997
And x is a , most cases it is a chloride and sometimes it is ch .	13.233316135464811
Now , how this , if you want to write a , a generic structure of , say , to write , write a cationic propagating species , which have , which a cationic reactive centre and a counter ion , which is represented by a minus , so what are the possible states they can represent.	10.382227818905536
If the difference between the rate of diffusion and the rate of biochemical reaction are too large then one of them will be the controlling factor and the whole reactor design must be based on that particular step.	9.89223539143102
So the form of substrate and form of enzyme will dictate the choice.	11.621275465069978
For the c - terminal alpha carboxylic group the pka is three and for the aspartic acid beta carboxylic group , the pka is 3..	11.92757670354693
So if there is a exothermic processes , delta t will be higher as a result of increase in heat , inside the sample.	9.115978638653305
As you know by this time that it is always recommended or beneficial to make or synthesize polymer having a definite stereo regularity whether it is isotactic or syndiotactic , they always have more helpful or more polymers which will have more utility compared to atactic polymers.	10.194801221618253
Colligative properties are those properties of a solution which depends only on the number of solute molecules , provided the solute molecules are nonvolatile and we are doing the measurements at very dilute solutions.	11.896721622420142
So , light scattering from a polymer solution will depend biased; it will be heavily dependent on the larger molecules , not the smaller molecules; which means , the property like lights catering depend more on a m w , not m n.	10.309745222124434
This is not going to the reactor.	6.459535994808318
Then , the resonance stabilization actually raditive , when they are present in a same carbon atom whereas , they are 1 2 substituent , then steric actually have a very detrimental effect.	10.218447796568924
In case of d t a; differential thermal analysis , a similar concept is applied , where you have a chamber , which has a inbuilt heater.	10.330628977605773
Now , rate of polymerization , r p , is given by rate of consumption of monomers.	7.223479767968852
So , in general we can write that if monomer can stabilize the resonance , the propagating radical the resonance the reactivity is high.	8.396192297673192
Obviously as i explained a few minute back that if your temperature goes up the chances of isomerization provided the isomerization will be higher.	9.263354496218145
So , in this case also , the r p goes up as temperature goes up , but it is not as , as much increase as in the case of thermal initiation process.	7.425128638839675
But compared to ambient conditions and the same catalyst , the catalyst here is zinc and the value is much higher.	9.67638660562535
It is not a micelle.	7.665444924007995
That means the evolving of the design of three dimensional structures to which this substrate molecule will fit will be exclusively specific for the orientation which is required for the catalytic reaction.	8.918002608475932
So , if you had the ratio from the ratio of the peaks of this corresponds to 3 protons for the monomer and this correspondence , and this corresponds to the 3 protons of the polymer , so from this ratio , you can find out what is the conversion of monomer into polymer.	9.07993674954472
Now , these are all specific examples.	6.7977621527202565
Now i am not going to go in detail about the steps; this mathematical steps you can get or you can refer any of the standard text books , you will find out that different steps in between.	10.926672979626561
So if a system experiences product inhibition and you use a cstr you are making the reaction going at very high product concentration.	9.388946465959634
In fact for calibration of the humidifiers we use saturated salt solution and each salt , when you make a saturated salt solution has definite relative humidity and those salts are circulated so as to maintain a constant water activity in the reactor and even control water activity.	10.048787323959885
So , basically this type of may this additives make the surface self - cleanic so or easy cleanic , the cleanic of the surface is done easily.	8.941737254579552
There is a thick film of substrate around the immobilized enzyme particle which will cause a substrate gradient across the film and therefore the concentration of the substrate at the surface of the immobilized enzyme particle is not same as in the bulk.	8.441434156427714
Just consider a general liquid; with decrease in the temperature , the specific volume will decrease and at a particular temperature freezing point , the specific temperature will go a discontinuity and then it will form a crystalline state.	9.68340031614125
You make ester , a removal of a water molecule.	9.228436677521804
Nanoclays , they are layered two dimensional structure , having thickness in nano dimension , they also used for in nanocomposites.	13.06964275192114
This is one set; this is second set.	9.249527957087237
If they were ever the unit to protect the brittle material inside like a cartoon , fast food , trays.	10.35506619485877
If the magnitude is large or sb is much , much larger than ss in that case film diffusion is the dominant player and so the nature of lineweaver burk plot under the range of condition of substrate concentration can give you an idea of the mass transfer coefficient.	9.270807643040872
So , these groups can be determined significantly.	8.379581118988769
Now , if you look at the production of thermoplastics alone , they are over 120 million metric tons.	8.692351959606034
Now if we recollect , this was proportional to n to the power half which is proportional to molecular into half which means three by two divide by m 3 by 2 would be some constant term because this two are proportional.	9.383796637148004
Now the two scientists paul flory and maurice huggins they proposed the theory which we will know in a minute which took consideration of the large difference in the size for the solute and this is polymers and the solvent and existence of the intermolecular interactions.	11.824305335017208
What are the considerations we must do as we can see that we do not require any calibration for this method.	9.572726971978364
Welcome back to this course in polymer chemistry.	3.424680136908303
These molecules can go further either into the glycogen synthesis as a storage molecule or further to fructose biphosphate.	10.698137259306025
In the next lecture we will take this and just complete the discussion of our phase separation of polymer solution.	7.688024951947477
For example , if you have diacid chloride , chloride plus diol forming polyester polyester , say diacid chloride plus diamine polyamide.	8.272543364152654
Typically , we present a polymer distribution at weight fraction versus molecular weight.	6.712631434489324
For e you again have only one pattern that is k2, k1a and k4 and that will be e0 ( k1k2k4 a ).	9.82800567858312
Now , you can recollect from our discussion , that its anionic polymerization , you have no bimolecular termination and in fact , in absence of any side reaction , if you have taken care of the condition , reaction condition in such a way , that no impurities are present and you have taken care of all the other purity aspects , then most of this anionic polymerization , actually , actually propagate without termination.	9.997895241775783
Now the first segment; now as i said earlier that i am showing this all are vacant , but these are all vacant i x number of cells are already blocked , already occupied.	9.577804623422022
Say , if you start with two monomers , m 1, m 2, you can have m 3, then typically we write , terpolymer , and that mostly three types of arrangement.	10.489862928462818
One of the major limitations of this method is that it will have the interference or some kind of error involved if the impurities contain molecules that also absorb near this wave length.	8.770341485045924
The film thickness can be very high and external film diffusion in those cases where we use substrates as very thick syrup is usually very high and external film also becomes a major parameter and as shown here if you consider a packed bag reactor with a liner flow velocity from 0.85cm / min to almost as high as 14.5 almost twenty fold increase gives you a km value which decreases from 7.76 to 3.79 almost half the initial value of km.	10.29892497594048
Otherwise the product specification will change and so in india they are using the inversion of sucrose using invertase because sucrose is available at fairly low cost and inversion of sucrose by invertase is the process which is used in india and again in the immobilized form.	9.812590586984987
So what we will do in the next lecture , we will continue this , the other types of initiator , and including the remaining example of , the redox , the possibilities of redox initiator.	7.058140721708131
This concentration is in the bulk.	9.702258710702555
So , there can react with the monomer and participate in a polymerization reaction the movement the reaction temperature becomes below of the t g of the polymers in that medium the polymers lose all the mobility.	9.452104316060336
Even at that level the effect of substrate concentration inhibition is noticed and the reaction velocity starts dropping.	11.22222494219897
Each point represents a particular enzyme to carrier ratio.	11.982061988214662
Now , these are these are all about steric resonance effect.	8.10885236586842
Now , before we molecule , we come to the discussion of molecular weight , we will define a term kinetic chain length , nu , which is average number of monomers polymerized per each radical , which initiate a polymer chain.	8.730515057290226
So , so this is , this is good to know the expression , but this is not very useful because we are , we do not know the values of x and a all the time and as a goes lower , that if more cyclization happen , x n comes down compared to if there were no cyclization , which in this case x n was 1 by 1 minus p.	9.263568229877379
L is less than one.	5.996752769195189
So when we talk of enzyme kinetics we are looking into the molecular dynamics of various species that are involved in the reaction , their interconversions and the effect of those inter conversions on the rate of reactions as a function of different parameters that are listed here.	9.381873615444263
So , what samples you will use for calibration where m v is much closer to any of the known molecular weight , say , m n and m w.	8.764728295490416
Then , it becomes quite easy.	9.495041124064649
Here f is equal to zero to t edt and over a period of time this continues and df / dt is the . . . distribution the differential of the function f c / c.	9.417310277433154
One example , there are many , many additives can be used; one additives , one type of additives are shown here.	8.778195684348939
And , there , there could be list of many such additives; for example , flame retardants which help in reducing the flame flame ability of the polymers , impact modifier , antistatic agents , antiblocking agents , anti fogging agents , optical brighteners , pigment and colorants , coupling agent , plasticizers , reinforcements , so many things can be added to enhance the property.	10.098272507267117
And that was synthesized during the world war two by emulsion polymerization , and that that had a great importance in the outcome of the result of the war.	10.949621626964515
Then you cannot really compare the two only by a steady state analysis or mass transfer and biochemical reaction.	7.8245666500082605
This will depend upon two factors one is the source of the enzyme and the purity of the enzyme.	8.974540192686684
The carrier cannot be regenerated.	7.834501166811568
With reducing temperature , becomes brittle and rigid whereas , applying high strain rate , makes the sample brittle and rigid , very slow strain rate mix the sample tough and ductile.	10.615292249249434
Now , how do you get this probability in x bar.	6.620261612439423
So , these are the examples of some of the solvents , which have , medium , low to medium polarity and does not high react with those ionic species.	8.174009651866642
We are aware of many of the sulphur drugs.	10.700861824073987
Similarly if there are more than one ionisable groups in the case of a substrate a similar analyses can be arrived at.	10.054551216532422
So , what happen in this way you are reducing the concentration of the radical active radical present and that will ensure that your termination reaction are negligible because this is a reversible termination reaction.	9.227830464551007
You bring the reactants into to a close box so that they act as one and they function.	11.036254854087725
Here is also a check that this sc.	12.205913531706992
They are close , but m m a is having much lower because in case of one one substituted the strain is much more compared to if have a only one substituted monomer.	10.36461487536554
We have used that formula , number of molecules present at the end of the reaction that means , in the step polymerization case , we have considered every molecules present at the end of the polymerization is part of the polymer sample.	8.551706655703253
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
So , if you plot; and , this has been shown experimentally; if i have this plot r p , rate of polymerization with i to the power half square root of i , it gives a straight line , so as this.	9.616149307043646
What happened if k and a are not known.	8.837107978129639
Typical example is yeast alcohol dehydrogenase which follows such a kind of mechanism.	10.333656194215001
They will be rich in the monomer may be right from acrylonitrile and once acrylonitrile is consumed , then you will get homo polymers of butadiene.	10.376558608179684
One of them is substrate inhibition the other is sigmoidal kinetics particularly as it applies to multisite and allosteric enzymes.	8.583000693821411
That s why it has not industrially become very attractive.	11.544150327206882
So , solvent can go from solvent side to the solution sides not the solute molecules.	8.226603914994218
So , this now again can react with m from r m n dot , it can m 1, m 2 and so on.	7.76289717863737
If you consider the example of let us say lipase.	9.470972597632926
The other feature which is very important is their specificity which is again not attributed to chemical catalyst and the enzymes provide a very specific catalytic system specific to the extent that we can recognize even the isomers they can distinguish.	10.325810349955278
They proposed a hypothesis that michaelis - menten hypothesis is very correct in most of the respect except that they did not agree that the interaction between enzyme and substrate is that of equilibrium behavior.	10.059725986961553
Then you make few dilute solutions , polymer solutions of frequent concentrations and say c 1 c 2 c 3 and so on , and get r solution for all these concentrations.	10.270749512562881
We talked about in these molecules during our discussion on radical polymerization.	7.166212376497956
Now , what is the probability of finding one free a group.	5.552161264288101
Let us go and see point by point and the slide first , that reaction rates , you know , reaction rates are generally slow for this poly , step polymers in typically rate constant are of the order of 10 to the power 3 liter mole inverse second inverse , which is very low.	8.54755110270282
Now , say , exothermic process , if you increase the temperature , the ions would be preferred to left hand side , which means , the ions will be moved towards tight ion - pairs sides , you know , comparatively.	9.834049756077238
So , you can carry out the reaction with this the salt of phenolate phenolate ion and you can make a polymers like linked this.	7.554242282776059
So , similarly we can write nylon 6, nylon 11, which gives t g of 52 degree centigrade , 42 degree centigrade and one very rigid polyamide , polybenzamide , t g is 500 degree centigrade.	9.958062673408934
Because ultimately if we can have more sulphydryl bridges , it is likely to result into higher stability or in other words most of the enzyme samples which are obtained from thermophiles that means the organisms that can survive in the extreme temperatures will contain higher content of sulphydryl bridges and they are probably the features that results into the higher stability.	11.988512131236847
So , let us first talk about the effect of polar groups.	5.705601208615155
So , as you get more performance from a polymer , you have to pay for more.	9.07639881585253
Consider two molecules say for example a and b which are supposed to react in the presence of a catalyst or without a catalyst.	9.530984693188163
And then if we find further this values of q 1, q and e for the other monomers by taking copolymers between them.	9.374560430683939
And as a result , they form a lubricating layer on the molds on the polymer surface.	7.08362474943754
Now , obliviously it will form , now why do we put the bracket will be always next to each other should i put the bracket here and put n like this , it may not be it could be somewhere here and there could be another bracket here.	10.652144798539585
So , you can directly write this expression from this.	6.418093365238509
Now , let us go back to the last lecture , we talked about that the k rate constant for step polymerization is quite low 10 to the minus 3 liter per mole per second.	8.517830190709372
And process ability actually becomes easier , as you can understand the , if the lower the at the molecular weight lower at the viscosity , so process ability becomes easier , if you have the low molecular weight.	11.178405773874195
These are some of the basic sciences which are important.	6.5921534062157505
The maximum product concentration is only at the outlet stream but across the reactor length the product concentration is much lesser than the outlet stream as the opposite happens in the case of a cstr.	9.383776793969801
So , they are undergoing the propagating radical for same duration which ensures that the chain length of the polymer produced is almost similar size.	8.97132933733112
And form these two you can write the critical these are just pure mathematics form you are getting these expression from flory huggins expression which we called earlier for the per segment gibbs free energy per segment.	11.434311896558235
We had as we mentioned earlier the rate of the reaction r r =.	11.42617041441133
The other system what you see is a sleeve.	10.438032799644901
The same reaction if you carry out at ambient conditions , 25c and ambient atmospheric pressures the turn over number is as low as 1.5x10 - 7, almost negligible.	9.56314473313502
So , if you make a new polymer you can get the molecular weight number average molecular weight from first principle.	8.189774665570766
And that is going to imbalance your monomer ratio , you must have you might have taken one is one ratio or whatever very close to one what is your target molecular weight.	8.926913785599579
In hydrolases by and large the most commonly employed industrial catalyst is used mainly because of simplicity.	12.156983245347547
Now , we know that degrees of polymerization , the first degrees of polymerization is given by the number of monomer group or functional groups at the beginning number of molecules at the beginning and by the number of groups at time t.	9.864669730654681
As we discussed , we recall from our discussion of chain transfer on radical polymerization.	7.886851941540182
One is that stringent requirement of polymerization in case of this ionic polymerization.	8.381994256545783
You start with a monomer you complete the polymerization reaction.	7.1785837292277535
Mind it that we are talking of exothermic biochemical reaction.	7.901133436291179
This is the charges electrostatic charges on the polymer radical and the monomer.	5.913108100911836
Now dyad tacticity; this term dyad tacticity is defined as the fraction of pair of fraction of pairs; these are pairs , this is another pair; so fraction of pairs of adjacent repeat unit are in a particular stereochemistry , say isotactic or syndiotactic.	10.623704895055383
Many uses or that is the most used technique , where.	15.131998365047966
And we were talking about the t c ceiling temperature and the equilibrium concentration of free monomer and we got this two expression.	8.653738579888426
Whereas when the block length is small , then they also scatter , but the size , because of the size is so small their scattering amount is low , so this block copolymer , the polymer material made out of this block copolymer will look , transparent , but slightly hazy.	12.364387265684936
You take this polycarbonate as synthesized in a plant or in lab , add these additives , pigments etcetera and we are compounding strips and you get pc pellets.	11.068783299871548
It is linear behavior and if it is something like that , it goes in this way and come back then , it is a nonlinear , nonlinear elastic behavior.	10.15116775668937
Parameter is basically gives you the difference when a solvent molecule is taken out from a solvent environment and put in a polymer environment.	12.33795590222573
That is the maximum reaction capacity assuming that the enzyme reaction follows a maximum reaction velocity , that is zero order profile and the productivity of that kind of the reactor will be your reaction capacity.	10.746190320240494
For example , you have to make sure that the functional groups are available during the entire reaction , so that some cases what happen you know these are exceptional case , where when you build a molecular weight after some size , it might feasibly turn the solution or from the melt of the reaction.	8.880987289353298
You can get a viscometer and typically the viscosity is measured by passing using this different viscometer where the solvent and the solution is passed through the capillary where the time is proportional to the viscosity.	9.56773767817446
That means binding to free inhibitor is not feasible.	7.515888432177055
So , as i said that mark - houwink equation derived before flory - fox equation as a empirical equation.	7.390809674440295
And we discussed that there could be one type where the polymer is soluble in the solvent at any composition , and then there could be another type where you have in left hand side and in this side , you have complete solubility , and you have a region where you have metastability , thermo dynamically unstable , but metastable for small fluctuation in composition , and then you have a completely insoluble region or unstable region.	10.948161417282828
So , we have talked about different initiator , and different way of , different types of initiator , and the how the efficiency of initiator.	8.326717021749836
The isotactic polymerization formation takes place.	8.562396924708814
So , what you have now for a different state of f .	9.753678159319717
It is taken out , but not all of them have been taken out of system.	8.668305882983196
Till now , we were discussing techniques which either can detect say viscosity average molecular weight or number average molecular weight , or the weight average molecular weight by themselves , but this methods were not enough to get the printed distribution of the polymer sample.	10.930765435604341
The enzyme containing serine residue or hydroxyl group on the active site attacks at the positively charged nucleus , the central carbon atom and there by produces an enzyme substrate complex by nucleophilic attack and the type of bond formed is ester type of bond.	9.754732790669975
Because the carriers are functionalized they are attached with the protein and when enzyme confirmation is lost protein is still coupled to them in the deactivated form.	9.867911806368685
Just like optimum ph , we also need an optimum temperature for a reaction which is known for a native enzyme.	10.114530198639002
Now , this can undergo intermolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction , which we called back biting , is basically the one end of the polymer chain is biting back in the main chain of the polymer forming a cyclic molecule and another molecule.	10.558224585041584
We can give other examples like poly pmma poly methyl methacrylate and polyethylacrylatethey all examples of structural isomers.	9.521960475660135
Now you can yourself imagine this is a very regular structure which means if you have regular structures , then the polymer chains can come closer to each other and pack very well.	11.240077625292729
So , if you have bonds you can have , you have no restrictions.	8.918744349019352
We have seen in our discussion , when we were doing this as stress strain curve , we have seen that the curve stress stain curve depends upon the temperature , as well as the strain rate.	9.015124914396052
So , what i will do.	4.2149693845613605
So , this would give the total expression for the rate of initiation; rate constant of the dissociation , initiate the concentration , this is the efficiency of initiator , and 2 we are writing because we are following the same conventions 2 here , and the logic is that because 1 initiator molecule is giving up 2 radicals which are initiating 2 chains , we are writing 2 here.	10.829770154343949
See , imagine how , what is the tremendous effect it has this discovery by ziegler and natta has made; a huge huge importance in polymer chemistry , which has given recognition to them in 196.	11.991163460711762
As i explained earlier the glycerol molecule is a symmetric molecule.	9.175872079037838
The principle remains the same.	6.481302825441452
If you have steep polymer back bone obviously , stretching it further or deforming it further is always difficult.	8.529253737787505
Now , we will move to the step growth polymerization and its kinetics and mechanism.	6.379215268515915
If you have ba or bb type monomer , it can only cyclize at stage.	10.246878737657278
Individually they may not be very strong in terms of bond energy but collectively in terms of number of bonds present they provide a very stable structure to a molecule.	12.568425718002329
If we are talking about a coupling reaction , then two radical chain ends has to come and collide each other.	7.837989323158563
But , it comes around total 4 hydrogen comes around 1 1, so this corresponds to 4 hydrogen of 4 aromatic protons.	9.827323053173016
And the amount of energy required to break this material is again is impact energy for this plate.	8.854526652444509
So , inactive micelles will slowly break releasing the monomer in the solution , and the they will supply the surfactant through the growing polymer particles.	9.719473500259092
Ultimately the transition state complex is somewhere intermediate between the reactant and the product.	9.07339100060039
This frequency can be arrived at from the theoretical treatment from two routes , by quantum mechanics as well as from classical mechanics.	11.368948401063822
This is ln v verses 1 / t for acetyl choline esterase immobilized in polyacrlyamide gel particles.	9.536164338785731
We are just , for short , we are writing m 1 dot here.	9.086909935050802
In fact most of the metabolic pathways although we understand qualitatively much better but still the quantitative fluxes of the individual enzyme catalysed reactions in a metabolic pathway is still a very difficult aspect.	10.269450947896662
Now if you have random co polymers , obviously they form a single phase , because they individual monomers does not make a.	9.397897893753733
K m + ss i mentioned ss that means i am excluding the film diffusion.	10.515727979081383
The enzyme loading will also have a direct linkage with the mass transfer limitations.	9.829684691026726
They are unstable molecules.	8.060858797857998
For linear polymer it can never go down below 0.5 but if you have branched polymer it is more compact.	11.441998559684981
Let us say this is k1s , k - .	7.268706034887196
In fact the diffusion process is much more sensitive to temperature effects than many of the catalytic reaction rates.	10.662025868334881
Remember , if you compare with the radical chain polymerization , this was the first reaction compared to the step , the first step , where radical was getting generated from the initiator molecule and we considered that as a rate determining step for radical chain polymerization.	9.385585054071333
There might be some exceptions.	8.091078987261916
So , we can again write same another equation and write ln c s as similar to the earlier cases.	8.509253917527584
Their behavior on the basis of the fractional conversion is identical.	8.211963046997626
The bulk enzymes as you can see here they fall in this category.	9.99333991098655
So , which means if we increase the polarity of the bonds , more will be the intermolecular attraction; t g will go up.	7.848237051810694
Under weightage at the low substrate concentrations and at high substrate concentrations near the origin the data points will be heavily concentrated.	11.778580489029544
So , in the next class , i will continue with this condensation polymers , and talk about the , compare between or the difference between chain polymers and chain growth polymers and step growth polymers.	8.329372002903808
Now they can exist in different state if the polarity of the medium is higher , then they will slowly move from methide ion covalent bonding to tight ion pair then to free ion pair.	8.255857679659778
So now , we can find out the expression for the intrinsic viscosity for the polymer sample which is the mixture of all the polymer chain which is given by limit c tends to 0 eta specific by c; eta specific is given by summation of i c.	9.900132842926329
Another very important factor which determine the value of t g is the mobility to rotate or the mobility of the polymer chains.	7.802202309449377
For example , how they work phosphites; they basically decompose these hydro peroxides , and form non radical products , and thereby decreasing the concentration , decrease the concentration of hydro peroxide.	10.242965880930816
We know how to make the polymer from our understanding of polymer synthesis and then we know that how it behaves in solution.	10.515889170094677
Some u , iupac has suggested that this should be named as poly condensation in then instead of step polymers or step growth polymerization , but step growth polymers is much more broader nomenclature compared to a term like poly condensation which is which is narrower.	11.745136958888041
And termination actually can happen in one of the three ways , like just , am just doing it a little fast.	11.340204220574293
So , the expansion factor will be; if you compare the expansion factor of unperturbed linear polymer chain it may go down below that below one.	8.533931952878412
So , if you decrease the temperature you are going to increase the concentration , the tendency of syndiotactic formation and if you increase the temperature then their preference would be lost.	8.409908023247183
So , it actually gives you idea it doesnot gives you exact sort of solubility behavior , but it this gives you guidelines or help you to understand , what is the solubility you know bring the solubility of the polymer in a solvent.	9.45042843140013
And the molecular environment and chemical nature , and how what is the constitution , chemical constitution of polymer and that determine , what is the solvent given that determines how good is the polymer polymer , and polymer solvent interactions.	11.21646264631718
So , rate does not get influenced much , whereas the molecular weight get drops.	10.799125495004352
Say , you have an oligomer or a polymer chain of hydroxy - carboxylic acid , which is polyester.	14.444711768345979
We have talked about higher yields for reaction undergoing substrate inhibition.	7.9256103074064
And then in chain dimensions , we will talk about size and shape of polymer chains , and take different chains , freely rotating chains , chains with bond angle and short range restrictions.	10.018298029392666
So , minus these are the expressions we know.	10.040478124088354
It can have branch chains , like you have this linear polymer plus you have these branches.	9.972021913237118
Most addition polymer have a backbone of carbon , so according to the definition of addition polymers , it should be addition polymers and not the original definition of addition polymers.	9.46557582377212
Y - axis is effectiveness factor and xaxis is thiele modulus.	9.743336056872954
So , if 1 hydrogen corresponds to 0.22, 0.57 integration will corresponds to 12.85 multiplied this by 5 you will get 12.85, so this is the number of protons.	9.773121299129452
So , final state is a non - equilibrium state.	8.9681537825362
So , equilibrium constant can be written as now , if the conversion is p , if the conversion at equilibrium is say p e in this case and m 0 is the monomer concentration at the beginning at t is equal to 0, then at the equilibrium what is the concentration of coh is p m .	10.341759530443499
Now , let us talk about a molecular weight in radical chain polymerization.	4.783637914092715
So , this oxygenator is mostly made up of polymeric materials and the membranes by which , this purification is done is also made up of polymeric material.	8.901504866791319
So , as long as there is 1 monomer is left in the reaction continue , and once 1 of the monomer get consumed , the reaction will stopped there , because the second monomer even if that is present in the reaction medium , that cannot participate in the homopolymerisation , so reaction is not proceed further.	10.22926374701038
Moldings are are these , these are techniques of molding injection molding , blow molding , these are applied for thermoplastics and compression molding transfer molding design applied for thermo sets.	12.260364561594757
Whatever tendency it has to react , it will make copolymer towards copolymer.	12.128966907779265
If you consider the stability fact of the enzyme with respect to ph certain enzymes are more stable under alkaline conditions.	8.326343903044659
So , if you , you can imagine as well , that as you grow longer and longer the number of conformations , which will enable the two functional groups at the present at the end to come closer and react and form ring will be lower and lower.	10.210054439262372
So , we can write m m plus r r plus m r is equal to again .	8.283282702167435
And finally , if we , if we neglect or ignore all the steps , we can , that is not required or we cannot have enough time to complete that what we can write that it will finally give the end to end distance like this.	10.894335642433788
This is counter a minus , is the counter ion.	8.683192045930555
So , we are going to talk about crystalline polymers.	5.93350941180835
The each cell has on average the same number of solvent molecules but the scattering happens.	10.103627507480676
So , this can react with each other or a polymer backbone and degrade the polymer or build the molecular.	8.38120108585274
You are proposing an operational reaction mechanism which may be slightly different than that proposed by michaelis menten or others earlier as we discussed and that mechanism need to be understood very clearly and that will give you a physical picture of the enzyme substrate binding.	10.068219125939194
If i had a chain here , then this is the cross - linking , it would have been cross - linking.	10.35355050364298
So , this is one very advantages advantage of your emulsion polymerization where n p as n p goes up , which you can achieve by increasing the surfactant concentration and increasing the number of micelle.	9.302293440548105
So difference in the absorbance is related to the concentration of the lactic acid.	10.195142021104482
It would be from this end to this end , this would have been the end to end distance.	6.951916019895513
Some example or few example of surface - active additives now , like this this additives or the other additives we talked about , they could be a small organic molecules or inorganic molecules.	10.633875535130793
If we plot g verses any of the straight parameters like temperature , pressure , volume , then it changes continuously.	10.849379522246451
The same theory applies as in case of light scattering; the expression k is the optical constant is different , because the case r different for different cases; because the source of origin of scattering.	10.86100764301305
Let us discuss little more in next page.	6.320843731454698
These parameters will be determined on the basis of initial reaction rate corresponding to either s or either p.	10.293884013828436
It could be a . . . electrode what you use in the fermentor for measurement of dissolved oxygen because that is amperometric transducer; it measures current.	9.859222794973757
What are the strategies we can achieve what we targeted one is to one of the monomers in excess.	9.757124070032237
So , average number of initiator residues for polymer chain is given by , n n a by 2 plus ( 1 minus a ) n 2 by 2 by a , this is we term as b.	8.831013902793448
Membranes porosity and this situation must be considered because that will determine the lower cutoff and its surface area also continued to the time it requires for equilibration.	12.013018493233549
It gives n a 1 minus p.	7.315935762997682
Then , this is found , this radical can react with monomer forming m n dot.	10.697668377374175
That means the sequence of nucleotides in a dna determines the amino acid composition of a protein and that particular portion of dna gets replicated , transcripted to mrna and other forms of rna and then translation of ribosomes to protein.	9.720399370294611
So , this is summation of all the concentration , of all the propagating radical present.	8.949583353745398
The whole reactor consists of a bundle of hollow fibers almost about eighty or hundred hollow fibers can be constituted in about one square inch of that order hollow fiber.	9.80507521768627
On the other hand we have certain enzymes which are broadly specific which are not very narrowly specific but we are not able to use them for variety of reactions.	8.133153192612017
With this i we will stop this class.	10.765054861808231
So , this initial reaction as well as , now this can undergo similar reversible addition and common fragmentation reaction.	9.378459148445462
Now this we will cover in this lecture and the next lecture which is lecture number 2.	13.49125705752638
Second , it should have low surface energy components so that , it migrates during processing technique during processing technique or molding processor , it migrates to the surface , to minimize the surface energy.	10.750507024728213
Most of the enzymes in organic phase are used in immobilized form.	8.348273844230825
These arrows represent this and this.	8.694140998562958
Now once you have a 1, 4 addition between cis and trans , if you just consider what is the possible structure of the monomer itself.	13.257360227568759
These are; say for example , clays.	15.099064499825243
So , polymer is one of the components among many.	9.357858706920688
Actually you can divide these techniques into two types; one is absolute molecular weight determination where we do not require any calibration curve of priority by known polymer molecular weights.	9.680273003695467
Therefore carrier itself should be very stable otherwise the stability of the enzyme will not have much of meaning.	10.746082397557696
So , termination reaction , if you can add h 2 o or say methanol or any other alcohol and which can terminate this reaction very quickly.	11.157201571571264
Now why do we need to study polymers in solution.	10.426681940265317
If m is close to infinity or m tends to infinity or t c is equals to theta , which means that critical miscibility temperature , theta is your critical miscibility temperature in the limit of infinite molecular weight.	10.255248692444498
That means if you multiply the lineweaver burk equation simply by substrate concentration on both the sides you arrive at s / v0 = km / vm + s / vm this also represents a straight line and if you see a graphical representation of such a plot of substrate concentration verses s / v0, you will again end up in a straight line position with a slope of 1 / vm and intercept of km / vm , the intercept on the x - axis as - km.	8.741561967274757
While the first step is reversible , the second step is irreversible and always the approach to stabilize and a similar effect is noted even for the ph.	9.948480047952607
Rest of the enzyme concentration will not be useful.	15.886509600560007
Now , the second options in this case would be where r both both r 1 is less than 1 and r 2 is less than .	8.5412924824389
So , either you can add trimethylamine to bring this species to closer to water side or you can add a phase transfer catalyst to bring this bisphenol a ion to the organic side to make the reaction faster.	9.223833032951426
So , from this point to the further onwards , is a plastic deformation happening , below this elastic deformation is happening , this is called yield point.	9.704579127700597
If the sb - ss is zero or very small quantity then there is no diffusional limitation.	9.18152738179931
Some of the advantages of organic media for bio - catalysis are : one is many of the reactions which require non - polar substrates lipids mainly are very difficult to carry out in aqueous medium because they are not soluble or the concentration that will be soluble will be very small.	10.387160577388393
So , we must have some mechanism whereby which the polymers can be vaporized without having any degradation or fragmentation of polymer chain.	7.777151876301877
If the enzyme , the glucose isomerase is an intercellular enzyme and if one has to really isolate , purify and then immobilize probably the process will not be viable.	10.226964681114692
So , we can get the molecular weight m n for the unknown sample.	5.8154394468145165
So by this way , we can get the number average molecular weight.	6.2042556071913415
So , v e is given by the outside volume and if the polymer is low , the size is very small then almost exclusively they will enter the pores and k s c will be 1 which gives us v e is v 0 plus v i.	9.629424566727417
And if you increase the free volume , polymer has more space to basically more space to chain with contribution and it becomes more mobile and the t g goes down.	7.733626930637639
This is not all desired.	9.454578800720395
So , with this , what we come to the end of this module on radical polymerization.	6.080239185696329
So , let us stop here and we will continue our discussion on gel permeation chromatography gpc or size exclusion chromatography in next lecture.	6.117220237048108
Vs is the maximum reaction velocity corresponding to substrate.	10.40497739108653
L is greater than two f is equal to 1 /.	6.591146226373699
The drawback is that they might , it is produced colour bodies , and that will discolour the polymer matrixs.	12.882159168053215
There might be two negatively charged , there might be one positively charged or there might be two acidic and one basic or more than that in the case of particular enzyme.	9.264528805228089
But all the analysis is identical and satterfield also provided a single point reactor performance equation based on film diffusion control for heterogeneous catalyst.	10.253122518636275
F1.q . c0 = f1.q . c + f2.v dc / dt f1.q . c is the fraction which will come out; f2.v is the one which is dead zone.	10.735684854717453
E when the enzyme is subjected to inhibition by excess substrate , it is more serious in the case of a plug flow reactor; effect of inhibition on the reactor performance is more detrimental in the case of pfr.	10.131010993078451
Bisphenol a poly carbonate is having this commercial trade names , i will be giving all this you know some of the trade names of this polymers in the next few slides as well.	10.616805994750692
It would be silica particle titaniumdioxide and conducting particles and so on , there are many examples of such nano particles.	10.599765477678753
The first and foremost factor is the change in the enzyme conformation itself.	8.46053998593409
This is for the ith components.	7.5455876975565355
H * - t.	10.026216479799922
That means many of the enzymes cannot be produced on a very massive scale because the requirement will be only for single reaction and therefore for a single reaction the requirement will not be very large.	9.948954064512627
Feed ratio , you can get from the like normal chromatographic analysis like h p as n g c.	12.1826607128755
So , if you increase the temperature what happens.	4.30816432848707
So , they do not show any optical activity.	5.212060047197719
An important feature of the performance of immobilized enzyme reactor is that one needs to identify the limiting rate , the step which has a limiting rate the lowest reaction rate.	10.856195449777546
The two equations which you can apply , this t g is for the resulting co polymer , or the blend , visible blend , which is given by w 1 t g 1 plus w 2 t g .	10.484246390509867
So , you have synthesized in this way a unsaturated polyester.	7.958247553347574
So , again this reduces the molecular weight of the cationic chain polymerization.	6.026517695737289
Now , as we just said , that e p is less than e t , most cases , most general cases , so this is negative , which means , that x n 0 goes up with decrease in temperature.	8.683604502476879
If there are polar molecules , obviously the are attraction between the similar molecules become higher.	8.596660668024924
The hydrogen bonds are attractive forces between a hydrogen atom attached to an electro negative atom.	10.726536789887522
One , they can be completely covalent bonding , covalent bonded , covalent bonded , one.	9.735707638999319
That is another major advantage.	7.32022858185199
Then , it will stay as it is.	7.908718159657969
So , they , this two are more common , where the molecular of repeat unit is same as structure units; where , second case where molecular structure unit is the summation of the average server.	9.126095253149034
So , here also we write .	8.955443171642957
We do ionic reaction in a polar solvent because if you have polar solvent , then this oppositely charge ions , ions will be well separated in the medium and if they are well separated , obviously , the reactivity of the active center in the propagating chain will be higher.	9.730069961974614
For each of the enzyme species we work out the path way by which these species may be synthesized.	9.482828366405444
We are now will talk about next type of additives , which are surface - active agents or surface - active additives now , this additives actual work on different interfaces.	10.835492574811784
If you are modeled in stress; like while modeling , because of some other reason , because not good flow in the material you have a , built in some stress.	10.83784499864612
They will also liberate the d - amino acids if there are , which are very uncommon occurrences in proteins can also be analyzed.	11.127071407393892
It is become brittle whereas , if you have flexible polymer chain obviously , it can absorb that energy and change it conformation.	11.028382376909745
Because recovering the enzyme from reaction mixture will be as difficult or as tedious if not more as production of the original enzyme itself and in most cases enzyme being produced by living systems are usually expensive commodities and therefore their deactivation at the end of one batch operation is not a desirable feature and that has been a major limitation.	10.75485104004308
The arrangement of different polypeptide chains in an oligomeric protein is termed as quaternary.	10.975258052144426
It is mostly reversible inhibitors which play a key role in most of the industrial processes.	8.790840354048322
The other important part is isolation , purification and stability.	8.812259424128051
And , another very important point polymers which is made industrially by this technique is as we discussed several times is the polypropylene.	10.64575560354881
Then , you will get something like and r 2 is very small.	7.836425703704854
Like it always comes , it always becomes opaque or translucent.	12.640837161239448
Now , suppose you have done everything right , whatever instruction is given to you in the this course or in any text book , you have followed everything right.	10.998232801989646
Although it is little more difficult in the sense that while enzymes provide you a large molecular size as well as a number of functional groups on the molecule which can be used for coupling to matrix where the required enzyme is a small molecular weight compound not such a large molecule and also the number of functional groups available on the molecule are very restricted.	10.362957896698092
Now , as we said in the beginning , instead of light we can also use the small angle neutron scattering and small angle excess scattering get information about polymer solutions.	8.462303761575738
Even people have tried to make fabric out of immobilized cells which then can be used for variety of industrial applications.	10.087014090989877
So , it breaks at a low strain elongation value similar , this is hard and strong , this is strong and tough and this is hard and tough and example of these are given in this table.	11.835473461257202
For example when we say general description i am talking of the reaction scheme that is the reaction which you are looking at catalyzing; then the source of enzyme - which enzyme and from what source has been used; carrier.	10.36723570666374
So , for making a polymers you require monomers which have at least two functionality in them.	8.717155897574514
But this method has been very extensively and very favorably used particularly for biomedical applications.	9.138018900511591
What we will do , again this is the continuation of the list we have and we will spend significant of time on the techniques which are used very frequently in the labs like gel permeation chromatography , light scattering technique , dilute solution viscometry and end group analysis and membrane osmomtery.	9.990217151931706
So , if you start well you can generate more and more interface and by doing by generating more and more interface you can make the reaction the polymerization reaction faster.	9.573401543573594
If i plot f 1 with f 1, in case of ideal , we have seen that is r 1 is r 2 is equal to .	9.634255557478346
Besides ideal reactor performance we have so far not considered anything about mass transfer , non - ideal flow.	9.758732291436251
Now , as the chain grows , the possibility , the kinetic feasibility of the two functional groups present at the end coming and reacting to form ring , ring , comes down , which means , that k c comes down as a reaction progresses because the kinetic feasibility , that the longer the chain , that chances , that two end will come and react each other forming intra - molecular reaction , forming a ring , is always lower.	9.73284147194322
That means whether it is the free energy change or the equilibrium constant of the reaction , it remains unaltered during the process.	8.461890457018326
There are at least three or four major units which supply glucose fructose syrup produced from sugar.	10.113237085894173
These are already reached , pure monomer is equilibrium.	9.163212872051844
So , if you consider m 1 and m 2, this three types of copolymers , you can have , which i think i have discussed in the first lecture , introduction one , these m 1 and m 2, the two monomers can get into the copolymer chain , statistically following a statistical law and one of the laws could be the bernoullian statistics , which is basically nothing but the random arrangements of this molecules without any bias.	9.735296961025108
So , we can make few dilute polymer solutions having different concentration and then measure pi of each of this solutions and then plot pi c versus c which may be something like this.	7.98428817852428
So , that gives you geometric or cis - trans isomerism isomers.	7.6973336008531925
Now , that is achieved by reversible termination or reversible transfer reaction , say i have an initiator molecule which is r z.	9.629333249395113
You initially feed the enzyme as well as the substrate and at the end of the reaction take out the final product and enzyme is mixed with it if it is soluble enzyme; if it is an immobilized enzyme preparation , you can filter it or centrifuge it to recover back.	10.895322199121292
When the substrate concentration becomes very high , the degree of inhibition will be 1 + i / ki but it will depend like competitive inhibition on all the parameters , the substrate concentration , inhibitor concentration , ki and km.	8.554655750826292
You are not targeting that.	9.166450234491238
If you consider this reaction although this reaction may have an optimum ph of , say for example , seven that means the rate of reaction is maximum at ph seven.	9.650410800015765
Just to illustrate my point with the simple example of a dimer having two identical binding sites , the reaction mechanism can be written as ks k2 e + s es e + p + + s s ks ks k2 ks 2 k2 p + e se + s ses es + p ( or ) se + p in all the four cases of equilibrium , dissociation constant is ks which are identical.	9.057179253237814
The net effect will be that ses is giving you two products and the free enzyme.	8.38566508846581
And of course we know that from our basic understanding of thermodynamics that usual thermodynamic condition of constant temperature and pressure , for a two component system , spontaneous formation of solution requires that the gibbs free energy of the solution is lower than the sum of the gibbs free energy of the solvent and the solute g 1 and g .	8.61132339470804
The aromatic amine antioxidants in the diamines , which basically , as we said , increase the rate of termination reactions.	10.79716089651674
Now this expression , which gives the molar ratio of m 1 and m 2 in the copolymer form that any instance , when the monomer concentration in the reaction medium , is m 1 for m 1, and m 2 for m 2 monomer.	8.952787825178827
N i is given by , if i can take out k outside this summation.	13.934098992658555
A matrix containing functional group x reacts with the functional group on the enzyme and the grafting takes place.	9.99096290741625
So , we move to polyether imides again this is the process of making polyether imides and these are again very high heat polymers; that means , this having very capability of you know they can be used in very high temperature.	10.005751974219667
So , now , we basically know these are the mechanism of zeigler - natta polymerization.	7.286038184844084
So , with this is the example where we showed that using proton nmr , you get the molecular weight , and obviously , you need a end group type , which is specific pick for end group it was the styrenic peak , which were available to determination.	10.023943624442387
R 1 is 55 in case of radical polymerization and r 2 is 0.01. this is for a radical polymerization.	9.180642603890389
That means the activation energy got changed.	8.657521282663351
So , this , this was the initiation reactions.	6.227874920508448
Del h is negative because it is an exothermic reaction , pi bond is converting to a sigma bond and del s is also less than 0 because the monomers is getting tied up into a more ordered state compared to a disorder state.	10.077552592475836
The second phrase which is very important is the retention of their catalytic activity.	7.525668838635032
If it is stabilized , then the deluge value comes down.	8.668344264742327
The reaction is also feasible under normal conditions without any catalyst.	9.709422924007802
You do film diffusion klam can be computed.	11.094304957585889
So , effect of solvent polarity , if we increase the polarity , for polarity for both cases , cationic and anionic , the effect in case of anionic polymerization is much higher because to begin with , they are much tight and if you increase the polarity , they can be free.	10.296877632300216
Higher and semi crystalline materials as processed at melting temperature placid , temperature 20 to 50 degree centigrade.	9.104347593959224
So , 6.5 on average.	8.300770994031282
So alkaline hydrolysis , which is very commonly used for determination of primary structure does not measure tryptophan.	11.206785021982492
If you plot flow rate inverse verses the overall rate constant , 1 / k , which is defined as the apparent reaction rate constant which takes into account biochemical reaction and also the external film diffusion as well as internal pore diffusion , then you get almost linear velocity with the intercept at 1 /.	9.402666286936308
So , these two point must have a common tangent so the and has the slope is given by this , which will also mean that mu 1 for the solvent at point c will be equals to mu 1 at d mu 2 at point c would be equals to mu 2 at d this two point will have same slope and have a common tangent.	9.371490843346729
Or , it can actually photo sensitize the another compound , and go to a , make a complex in excited state , which further can dissociate producing radicals; for example , if you have it react with a molecular this , form this is the composes , and this can initiate a chain polymerization.	10.902956298177571
When we look at quantification of an enzyme molecule or enzyme sample or what we know as assay methods they also take into account these two major characteristics.	9.305501309975709
But it cannot form the peptide bond under the mild reaction conditions at which we are talking it will be only feasible , if you have an acid anhydride group.	11.887939257169476
So , it is basically the entropy of mixing , which entropy of mixing which determines whether a polymer will blend , will form miscible blend or not.	7.390125712143011
And sometimes , some people write this is this gives you isotactic , so they write i; they gives you syndiotactic , so they write s and this is heterotactic , they write h.	10.946920148177192
Instead to two binding sites there can be three binding sites also.	11.112371004361632
We will impose the second restriction and see how this dimension changes.	9.449294426151214
The conditions that are imposed on the use of immobilized cells are that the cells should not contain the interfering enzymes catalyzing the side reactions.	9.379332879093768
Very large variations of reactor designs have been reported.	11.529743740137395
So therefore a carboxymethyl group is generated here and carboxymethyl nad is then activated by carbodiimide , the reaction which you are familiar , with the carboxylic group containing enzymes by activation by carbodiimide and therefore you get an activated co - enzyme molecule.	9.811423201263718
And we discussed , we just introduced the concept of living polymerization and let us begin from the same page , we left in the last lecture.	7.91127985388751
Advantage is that we have seen that the reaction polymer polymer reaction rate as well as the molecular weight goes up with increase in monomer concentration , which is not true for increasing initiator concentration for initiator increase in initiator concentration rate goes up , but the molecular weight comes down.	10.897350785946516
These are the four different kinds of operational stability that have been noted and you will notice that they all.	9.506636192363839
So , for example , calibration is done for polystyrene then using this calibration curve we can determine the molecular weight of polystyrene sample only , because the k and a value will remain same for polystyrene only.	9.031125147421406
Here just like we consider the enzyme substrate binding where the enzyme acts as the carrier and the substrate is ligand here the carrier will be the matrix and the protein will be the ligand and on those conditions you can develop it or you can analyze it by a double reciprocal plot.	10.6096889233971
Theoretical polydispersity is always two , if we get a high enough molecular weight because that given by 1 plus p , p should be almost one to get a high molecular weight.	9.847833234163607
They are sometime , as i mentioned in last lecture , that you might require to control , restrict the molecular weight of the polymer you are making.	9.557537408436417
See we discussed that this is by the total initiator molecule.	11.806185174555928
One of the well known reported methods is modification of enzyme by coupling to polythene glycol.	9.495556891107025
So , they form a lubricating layer on the base polymer surface and improve the wear resistances , these are the examples of few mold release agent.	7.2125208236039215
So , you we can write the expression one more time for the rate of polymerization for thermal polymerization is k d i by k t to the power half.	7.24440398661385
So , the value of or fluctuation for this group increases.	7.408455739454767
One of the most accepted theoretical interpretation of chemical catalyzes can be considered from point of view of chemical reaction rate theory which illustrates that molecules can react only if they come in contact with each other.	8.397967058714865
And there are relative methods where you actually require a calibration curve by known polymer molecular weight where the molecule and the molecular have been determined by these absolute techniques.	9.955117477390685
Consider an enzyme reactor.	7.334055842559531
In today s lecture , we will continue our discussion which we started on determination of polymer molecular weight.	5.920592006125034
H is the hydrogen ion concentration which you can convert into ph.	10.769995151387148
In today s lecture we planned to cover interfacial polymerization , and we also will be talking about different synthesis of different step polymers in very brief briefly.	9.411600317001247
This should be z minus 2 n 1 phi .	10.772220864841179
So , that weight fraction which eluted the polymer between this v e and v e plus d v e.	6.397140570399375
Which means that this process of spontaneous phase separation is thermodynamically not visible , which also means that each point or each solution in this line corresponds different pie 2, they are all stable.	9.987732189031055
As you will notice that in both the types of behavior there is a significant increase on deae - cellulose by ionic binding or deae - sephadex slightly less increase but on covalent binding there is decrease in activation energy and these change in the activation energy is a resultant sum total of the diffusional effects and the biochemical reactions and the entrapment in polyacrylamide also results in decrease in the activation energy.	9.337706080193746
The characteristics of the bed can be theoretically numerically accounted by voidage what we call as a factor called epsilon which is the wide volume in the bed divided by the total packed bed.	10.193387450726638
If you start a point somewhere above this point , then less fraction of m 1 would get into the chain.	7.920262047539713
You can just hypothetically put some values of let us say a safe value for epsilon for a typical packed bed reactor varies from between 0.4 to0..	10.793899243218414
You have a chain transfer agent here which is having general structure or something and gives you the more common , most common structure.	10.694380241801582
But in addition to the binding site there are many unfavorable interactions present between the substrate and the active site.	7.985989095496585
So , we can simply write from these two , v is v 0 plus v i e to the power minus a s l dash by .	7.253635048757581
M n was n i m i by n i.	9.584900903325899
This is arbitrarily; there is no order as such.	9.687757560744195
So , by this way you can , you can terminate a cationic chain polymers with a desired molecule , in this case alkly halide , and you can make functional groups at the end , which you can utilize to form different functional groups and then for the reactions impossible in that functional groups.	9.426428395140451
Now , just to spend a minute why these are processing is so much dependent or molecular weight.	7.8230128319172385
One of the major advantages is that it provides extremely large surface area for the enzyme substrate complex and the enzyme substrate contact within a small volume.	8.359906166674365
Or it could be due to resistance , due to intra molecular because , the polymer chains are entangle so , different parts of the chain are linked.	10.357803012964895
Or we can if it is not a homo polymer , it is a blend of different phase , there is a basically there could be two , one a soft or rubbery phase and a hard or elastic phase.	12.301626317450651
If you take a reasonable time then the multiplication of turn over number or rather not exactly turn over number but sum total of ( k1s + k - 1 + k2 ) , out of which only one factor is turn over number , that magnitude if it becomes large enough so that the exponential of it s negative is approaching zero , our system will turn up into a michaelis menten expression.	8.772264810848794
Next example is , this is we are tying to we made a block copolymer of poly tertiary butylacrolate , and polystyrene using living radical polymerization raft , so this is the monomer.	10.524130138389028
Where from they will get they will get this surfactant micelle , they will get this surfactant , there are other micelle where the polymerization is not started , when you start this polymerization this radical will not go in all the micelle containing monomer.	11.061668313189188
It should be n 2 x minus 1 and then z minus 1 e plus ln x.	9.678631626148702
That means the feed rate of the substrate is same as the output rate of the product stream.	9.556095747424129
Obviously the enzyme is not available in the quantities that many of the other enzymes , like amylases and proteases , are available.	10.199337380295166
Now , this is the term will give you the enthalpy of mixing the way this expression has been proposed , it always gives the entropy the enthalpy of mixing.	7.8488446797721805
When it passes through toluene after residence time in toluene , the polymer cellulose triacetate gets coagulated; it is no longer soluble and then the fiber that are formed contain the enzyme micro - droplets which was earlier emulsified into the solution of cellulose triacetate which are entrapped in the fibers.	11.000723099674964
And in today s lecture we are going to discuss the relationship between the chemical structure of a polymer , and the melting point.	6.778457712611703
They are just like a lock and key; there is no flexibility.	11.761149501269907
So you get the concentration of enzyme substrate complex and based on this hypothesis you get the initial reaction rate.	7.682316623008309
There are some minor conformational changes but not as high as alkylation or ionic binding but there is some conformational change also occurring.	9.933434980842614
So , you can plot eta s p or this term inherent viscosity with respect to c and then from slope and the intercept , you can get the value of intrinsic viscosity.	8.500065872532781
So , you multiplied each one n i m i which will give you the weight of or mass of the , that sample and you sum over all the samples and divided by total number of moles gives you the m n 1, number average molecular weight or you can simply write this as x i m i where this x i is mol fraction of the molecules having molecular rate of m i.	9.668740661798592
So , it is very critical when we make that , we now we know how to make this polymers , and what is the molecular weight of the polymers we made.	8.340839600772139
A very crude term could be the enzyme keeps leaking values , very small amounts , slowly not in a very fast rate.	9.415957043290737
Because of the presence of the crystalline regions , it gives resistance , higher solvent or chemical resistant.	10.403115777387015
Now , what is the tendency of a monomer to cyclize , participate in cyclization reaction compared to a linear reaction.	8.972327854922323
They are called spinodal points.	6.588950503298926
Even in the earlier example we discussed the hydrolysis of esters , it is an addition of water molecule to the ester which leads to transition state.	11.07522687928554
The shaded portion indicates the organic medium and the blank spaces are indicated by water medium and the enzyme particles are marked e.	11.21585867566558
It s a three dimensional network.	8.233303859819312
Now if have tight ion pair , then the smaller the size of this counter ion , the tighter would be your interaction between the anionic part and the cationic part.	11.18339015862371
And in case of d t a difference thermal analysis , the same amount of heat is supplied to sample and reference , at a constant rate , and the difference in the temperature between the sample and the reference , is plotted against the temperature.	8.653310763818293
If you look into the reaction profile , a typical substrate verses initial reaction velocity profile , for a hyperbolic kinetics goes like this with an asymptotic reaction velocity vm.	9.321007933251089
The other examples could be per sulfate plus diamine , a very common or very popular use of this combination is typically used for making polyacrylamide gels , which is a combination of ammonium per sulfate aps and temed.	10.439334759804849
So , it is a serial process.	6.111654993440201
Incidentally bulk of the applications are in the field of hydrolysis that means hydrolytic reactions.	10.906000629959042
So , these term , i can simply write k p m and m dot; i am just writing the m dot.	8.5450437313716
Now , you have seen , now it can undergo hydride elimination and form an ionic end.	8.14293575680954
For example , condensation polymers are polymers which fulfill any of this criteria.	9.769596502446376
This is what we had discussed yesterday.	9.308472785798651
And say ethylene oxide to poly ethylene oxide.	10.799471317221274
And large fraction actually is greater 95 percent of the fraction of the monomers will be present as large droplets.	11.100922665741827
But same times , same logic , when they come close , they will stay longer , because their rate of the fission is lower.	11.231200501120645
Then in that case , you can live , build that high molecular weight leaving little excess amount of the condensate.	11.439244411348856
So , we do not need a calibration curve if we have an absolute molecular weight detector like the light scattering detector.	9.432403768382763
Now , there is one more termination is possible , which is not a transfer reaction , which is basically in true sense , which is a termination reaction where this counter ion and this ionic species , the cationic properties can species combine into to form a covalent ball.	10.730855687641816
As a macromolecule , we will notice that the properties of a macromolecule will largely depend upon the constituent monomers.	11.208028936386329
So , let us stop here; what we will do in the next lecture is to start from this curve and first we will know how to convert this detector response to weight fraction of the polymers and illusion volume to molecular weight , and then discuss about the different aspect of gel permeation chromatography , calibration and other experimental related things.	8.866532618782355
In the third case , in the case of cell growth , the mannose model of microbial cell growth it is a substrate which is a ligand just like enzymes but the matrix is the cell mass itself and it reflects the transport of substrate into the cell.	10.190113927948591
So either you can plot apparent km or you can plot slope.	12.821434116450835
Glucose is a substrate.	9.286561140512017
The other analytical application sector was as a therapeutic agent and with development in the availability of different enzymes and particularly the understanding of molecular basis of deceases the use of enzymes as therapeutic agents is by and large increasing.	10.378491594738268
No separation is attempted.	14.502765541687884
So , this is the number of ways you can add the first segment.	5.308932155994297
With increase in temperature by just thinking , that with increase you get more number of radical generated in the polymerization medium for a given time.	9.673359233933805
That means first of all the reactor which is to be used for bio - conversion of the enzymatic reaction is packed with the carrier itself and then the enzyme solution is recirculated constantly through the carrier bed and over a period of time the enzyme gets adsorbed on the matrix.	9.426728534716977
So , for pure polymer n 1 is 0 and for solvent n 2 is .	8.287417044207357
The two issues of unstability and possibility of their use repeatedly or in a continuous mode has been the major driving force of looking at immobilization as an approach to provide a vector platform for the use of enzyme in industrial application.	9.965553910551971
A result of incorporation of a solid particle in a reaction mixture and particularly we consider a porous solid particle where most of the enzyme has been immobilized on the interior of the particle.	9.258849571720322
On the other hand we have a whole range of engineering sciences which are important as far as enzyme technology is concerned.	7.707226964508606
We have been discussing so far the steady state analysis of mass transfer and biochemical reaction in immobilized enzyme reactors.	5.937983055002845
In the case of food constituent we don t want the enzyme protein to go as a product in the product stream.	7.805293117553776
So , you have this initiator , coinitiator complex , which starts the chain initiation.	7.417631233424674
Now , if this bond if chosen in such a way , in this case , it is higher bond that this can again reversibly fragment by homolitic cleveage.	8.82995903675415
So , waste management of polymeric materials is a very important step and like the one , where polymers are need to be synthesized or produced from natural sources.	10.012759824566587
So , in most cases it is preferred , it is done , that at the end of the reaction some additional steps are done to strip off the cyclic molecules , small cyclic molecules from the final product , so that when you take that polymer , which is in the , at the end of the reaction , which you are taking forward for molding process , which will be , have least amount of cyclic , cyclic molecule present.	9.361346011722814
And , if the rate becomes limited , you know , when they becomes equal , whenever the chain grows , the significant number in this case , say .	11.108177205609277
In all these analyses we have assumed that the flow pattern in the reactor is either perfectly mixed that is the contents of the reactor are homogeneously mixed without any stagnant . . . or without any dead pockets in the reactor or alternatively in the case of plug flow reactor the velocity profile of all the fluid streams are flat and it can be described by a ideal plug flow behavior.	10.212709260158308
So , basically electron density on the double bond if there is a electron donating group then the electronic density or the electrostatic charge will go up , then q value will be going up.	9.332161353466038
So , there is no question of local heat formation , local spot formation , hot spot formation and degradation of molecules and thermal control becomes easier.	8.400590637373442
How the nature is , the microstructure of the copolymer from definite pair of monomers and the possible drift in the copolymer composition from these values of r 1 and r .	9.333394588952876
Initially it is a straight line which is linear and then it tapers off towards the end when the enzyme concentration becomes high.	12.611688262669503
So , these are all in your hand.	6.046966322326664
So a first order approximation is not something which is invalid and as i mentioned earlier if you take certain data roughly an error of about ten percent in calculation of the space velocity is encountered.	11.257647440044796
If you have fillers , which are having higher size , compare to , is not very small size , have a significant diameter , then their will scatter light.	9.65743964165749
The equilibrium value of the free monomer concentration at that temperature determined by this value , del h p and del s p.	7.845713969622848
Now , the other main types of initiator , thermal initiator are azo compounds.	8.525163878460836
One is the maximum reaction velocity which is v0 = k2 ( e0 ) km = k - 1 + k2 / k1 another point i like to make it clear here is vm is not a kinetic constant.	7.946878218752226
Now which one of these three possible stereo arrangements which will be dominated that again determined by the medium where you are doing and of course , the initiation mechanism as a cationic mechanism or radical mechanism you have taken.	11.088815810276314
That means all the kappa factors put together for e , es and et.	7.245688399006184
So , in this case you expect that this will show optical activity unlike , say , molecule like polypropylene and indeed they do show optical activity.	7.928339996367732
At any point , i say , you start a reaction with your free monomer concentration less than m e , then will what will happen.	9.032256798529527
So , its resistance to hydrocarbon solvent is poor.	9.335940078489642
And they absorb water , which form channels through which , the static charge can dissipated so , there is no formation of static charge.	10.318803324556196
For example yeast alcohol dehydrogenase follows a random ternary complex formation as a part of the dynamics of their enzyme substrate interaction whereas the same enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase from the mammalian cells doesn t follow this kind of mechanism; it follows an ordered mechanism where it can bind only to one of the substrate first before the second substrate can bind and that s why the kinetic parameter will automatically turn out to be different.	9.756494964488223
And . long term issues : like , how they function , there long term longevity , and they are effect in the environment; they must , this should be considered; for example , if you are using some the packaging film for food application , then the additives should not leak out and contaminate the food.	10.317666874107362
Now , again , from definition of a conversion , we can write that amount of monomer present is , the amount of monomer present initially at t is equal to 0, minus conversion which makes this; and i am going little fast , but you can yourself go through it and understand no problem.	9.027560709953006
So , it is very very need a basic need to understand the polymer properties at least in brief.	8.017876852397468
Then enzyme concentration goes down , the enzyme substrate concentration builds up and this is the enzyme concentration and this is es concentration.	13.766064805148346
When we talk about the binary complex formation , in the case of ping pong mechanism the pattern will change and that will clearly indicate the existence of a different mechanism.	10.112278530004883
So , the value of this basically determines where polymer will mix or becomes soluble in a solvent or not.	7.316060930193574
The gas gaseous monomer is getting transferred to a polymer.	9.914399334592316
This you can write many steps , and in general , i can write dot.	12.419922170393974
So , so that is the maximum possible concentration you can have in , in to minimize the cyclization.	10.423990674328657
In a membrane reactor in which a reaction has to be carried out , i illustrate a general redox reaction , ah plus b going to a plus bh.	10.730566905946162
Now this single bond can be easily rotatable.	11.206704438882424
We must be able to analyze or get the kinetic features or characteristics of any enzyme catalyzed reaction broadly in terms of the value of k2 that is what we call as turn over number and vm and km value.	9.833721935556984
So , basically you can use these as such , or you add blend this two another homopolymer , and because the presents of this rubberic code , which is soft , this actually improves the impact property , because this is the soft impact , it has observe the impacts , and actually makes the polymer material , less brittle compare to either polystyrene , or a ecopolymera polystyrene , and acrynitriles , so these are my example.	10.224689020116099
All the enzymes we talk about are all globular proteins , structural proteins are not involved in catalysis and therefore the rest of the amino acids by virtue of their folding pattern creates certain niches , certain crevices , cleft on the surface of the molecule which acts as active site and the functional groups attributed by the amino acids in that cleft take key role in binding as well as catalytic process.	10.030355768853806
The final washing in the case of reactor loading process is done with the substrate solution itself because during the operation it has to meet the environmental conditions which are provided by the substrate solution , the feed.	10.819211626826933
This is usually done in a repeated batch reactor using immobilized enzyme and the immobilized enzyme is retained in the reactor either by providing a mask for filtering the enzyme to be retained in the reactor or it can be strained after the product stream has been recovered.	9.920140176402814
This is some kind of incomplete immobilization.	8.909216660028571
Another data is on the influence of particle size on the michaelis constant of immobilized enzyme.	10.196415790259557
Now , if there are , if r has an alpha hydrogen; if r has an alpha hydrogen , it can further form epitomic type moiety.	9.013889244877374
There could be several processes.	8.292577229499987
Now , what does this expression says that , if the size , if the size x 2, the value of x 2, if the value of x 2 goes up or the values of x goes up , then the size of the molecules is going up.	10.622836154101632
Now , after end of reaction and n 0 was the number of molecules present at the beginning , so how many number of molecules reacted.	8.050124872778213
So , you can take advantage of that difference in activation energy and you can decrease the temperature.	7.480117272331707
Now how many different ways the solvent molecules can be placed in the vacant cells.	9.85948470792238
Now , you can ask me till when , till what time we call a molecule as a polymer or oligomer.	9.48662192546941
The analysis of continuous immobilized enzyme reactors interms of their performance has been based on the kinetics of the enzyme reactions.	10.600486318080865
Mind that we are not considering under idealized reactor conditions.	11.437480573161311
Then chain polymerization is usually consist of three main step; initiation , propagation , and termination.	9.399360584550868
The third and probably most expensive classes are therapeutic enzymes which are exclusively required for medical applications almost like life saving drugs.	9.70975186314499
It can determine typically up to 10 to the power 5 to 10 to the power 6 mole per inverse molecular weight.	7.247425071191986
That will give you the highest molecular you can achieve.	11.238458147254361
So , in case , we find in a step polymerization , that our polydispersity is less than 2, in spite of having a high molecular weight.	8.348957609198823
That means most of the substrates which is being fed gets converted into product.	9.332049287328827
In the competitive inhibitor the binding of the inhibitor to es complex is not feasible and the dissociation constant is infinity.	9.139661213075557
Then for example we have , say , from hexanediol plan adipic acid we form poly hexamethylene adipate.	11.08338210917142
A major question that will come is what do we mean by immobilization.	10.160996339913279
So , let us start the discussion on ionic polymerization and let us talk about first the general characteristics.	7.416153856293383
These side chains react by donating a pair of electrons to a centre of partial positive charge on the substrate molecule , a nucleophilic attack.	10.610107462976272
And as i gave examples of aliphatic polyesters from lactones and polyamides from lactones and this is also very common where linear poly siloxanes or silicons are synthesized by anionic or cationic polymers of cyclic siloxanes so with these we end our discussion of ring opening polymerization.	9.211693773468802
That means maximum reaction velocity in the case of single binding site is vm = k2 e0 if there are n binding sites the only difference will be , it will become vm = n.	9.33128553489388
The temperatures for this sample , and the reference are kept maintain same.	10.737834775398033
Now , if this is the lipophilic center , if we increase the electrophilicity of this carbon , then the attack of that phenolate coming from this phenolate group will be more feasible.	9.451297513819005
Usually they are bisubstrate reactions involving two substrates.	11.785380034376585
So , if you divide the total number of functional groups unreacted by 2, it will give you the number of molecules left.	7.686866862646023
Now , if they gets terminated by coupling reaction , the polymer which is formed here , that will have number of degrees of polymerization or total number of monomer present in that chain , will be twice nu.	9.881449781329499
Third is antigenic properties hypersensitibity and immunological reactions.	10.561030584907634
Carbon dioxide is not allowed its not bothered about because carbon dioxide even if it reaches in the blood the body has a capacity to exit out to lungs assuming that the lungs are functioning properly of the patient.	10.828801754748628
So the cell should not contain any interfering enzyme.	7.7235906010962845
So , basically if i talk about the monomer like this , then the ability to of the y group to stabilize any resulting radical and then polar polarity polar effect.	8.783353275541247
So , what happened.	3.3923006055986513
So , that value of acrylonitrile polymerization will be lower , so that 76 compared to 8.	11.574916219255384
That means if the substrate is ionisable it can be measured or it can measure the product of the enzyme catalyzed reaction.	7.99526924310855
So , in this case where it was very easy to deform or set up small , mixture of small molecules in this case because of the large molecules it is difficult to deform a polymer molecules which gives you high viscosity , which gives you the high strength of the polymer molecules , high impact resistant , toughness and all other good properties of molecular polymer samples and that is why polymers is so popular now a days.	10.12484364350592
So , we have now discussed , that kinetics , the rate of reaction in case of anionic polymerization.	6.707947087356681
So , you either need a cation or a anion to sort of initiate a ring polymerization so initiation by in case of ring opening polymerization the initiation is done by the same types of ionic initiators as in the case of ionic polymerization of carbon carbon double bonds.	8.54491876355729
The modified maximum reaction velocity is equal to vm = vm / ( 1 + i / ki ) if you look at into the mechanic concept the total fraction of the enzyme molecule which was originally present for catalytic function has now got distributed into es , ei and eis and only a part of it which is in the form of es is catalytically functional and therefore the maximum reaction velocity which is a function of enzyme concentration is reduced.	9.505020393926957
We know , that this side reactions cyclic formation , if cyclic formation takes place too much time , they will come out of the reaction and your goes up.	10.356052979976033
Now let us talk about , little bit about , the transparency of a polymeric matrices.	8.020654695956015
That may be also true , so that continuity in some extent of this cause of increase in t g with more bulky group.	11.280034508266567
Now , let us have , let us see some data related to convince that understanding.	8.336568152597918
In the relationship kd . t, t is the time of reactor operation.	9.586618789501477
That means that fraction of enzyme will be ineffective and the ratio of the two that is l / lc will give you effectiveness factor.	8.596194598543498
So these are the two reaction where in this case; m 1 is getting m 1 star is getting consumed in m 2 star forming , and in this case m 2 star is getting consumed , and m 1 star is forming.	8.463880832486112
Polymers are large molecules , which is made from repetition of structural units.	10.898502240027707
We will just start form this in next lecture.	6.313300123585324
So , when you release stress , that energy is given back so , you gave you get back to original state.	8.812161977657452
And here stress is linked to the rate of change of strain with time , and the proportionality constant is the viscosity.	10.786438171898519
So , now , i write this rate of termination is now got there it is a bi molecular reaction.	8.575937200379434
So , with different so , this is a plot of lock elastic modulus with temperature , which shows that , different regions of polymer elasticity.	9.45739218341797
So , with the lights , the forward scattered lights , which is scattered beyond 2.5 degree , compare to the incident light , would be taken as the value for haze , and haze characterized the loss of contrast , that result when object are viewed through the scattering medium.	10.22930279423045
Otherwise the reactor performance in the zero order regime is identical.	9.152526939582433
The most significant part is that they regulate the various functions of the cell in such an accurate manner probably no other control system in any chemical process plant can think of.	10.365789242363858
The reaction cannot take place in the absence of cofactor whereas in the case of activator we are only enhancing the rate.	8.293907812170266
The globular form of the folded protein is termed tertiary structure.	10.630649696662196
So , we have these three assumptions and which is reasonably fair if we deal with dilute polymer solution.	7.952849317136073
So , how do you increase the reactivity of this reaction.	8.13787647166808
So therefore the reactors in the form of continuous stirred tank reactors are ideally suited for substrate inhibited reactions rather than product inhibited reactions.	9.045933572469998
If it is form from two monomers likes this terephthalic acid plus ethylene glycol you get polyethylene terephthalate.	9.092414440455824
If this instauration is at the end of the polyester , which you formed then these are known as alkyd polyesters , how do you do that , the same reaction like in this case phthalic an hydride glycerol there you are hiding one mono functional acids , which has a alkene group a double bond at the other end.	10.31089571985966
In conclusion by lowering the energy of activation for the reaction , a catalyst makes it possible for substrate molecules with a smaller internal energy to react.	10.005020184939712
There could be very clear cut partitioning effects with respect to hydrogen ions because they are positively charged and a poly ionic carrier will definitely have preference for hydrogen ions.	10.777425049704837
The substrate value comes down to zero.	6.681701133270917
And so this is always favors mixing this is always gives you negative contribution towards gibbs free energy mixing , this is always favors mixing.	10.439554369513644
And then following this discussion on how to get number average molecular weight , we will start discussion on determination of weight average molecular weight by light scattering.	9.037947430453514
At the last lecture what we discussed was the relationship between the mechanical properties , and chemical structure or polymer chain properties.	10.395244517349669
At ph nine the concentration of hydrogen ions will be hundred fold less , one hundredth of at ph seven and therefore you can drive the reaction as far as the equilibrium constant is concerned but at a very slow rate.	10.562214019521484
Now , as we know the rate constant or rate of the reaction is much faster , for termination is the highest rate and then propagation and then initiation , we can simply write from or that knowledge , that e t is , should be greater than activation energy of , this must be greater than e p because this is the most , this is the fastest reaction and this is also fast reaction where the initiation is a slower reaction.	10.418419979650434
In the enzyme system the reaction will have only one set of km and vm and that will be the one which is obtained by intersection of these straight line relations and that gives you a perfect check on your experimental data.	10.010218405746778
Now , i can write generic reaction for this type of reaction.	6.0542933874826526
The product of these two probability is x minus .	9.654951031856065
A disk cannot be made up of pmma , will not survive a temperature of 80 degree centigrade.	9.546069916407076
So , basically the polymerization dictated mainly by the enthalpy change because 3 and 4 member ring are highly strained when they open up and polymerize and gives a lot of this energy , which was already which is getting released because of ring opening.	9.803367798695104
And you have done whatever i have been instructed to you have done that.	9.256301997208084
Then they also undergo catabolic repression that means the availability of an easily assimilable carbon source and the most easily assimilable is glucose represses the synthesis of the enzyme.	10.107902814079582
I said the reason as well , that because there are possibilities of size reaction and one such size reaction being cyclization , there is invariably formation of some small molecular weight cyclic molecules and as a result , when you have the small molecular weight cyclic formation , both the m w and m n comes down.	10.089191573195649
We know the contribution from the combinatorial entropy which is always favoring mixing.	8.842966472781203
So , this curve now is for theta is equals to 0 and this is for c equals to .	8.613668783693107
So , both large decrease in the molecular weight as well as the decrease the large decrease in the rate of polymerization and this we term as degradative chain transfer.	8.676341538623655
Because it is used in the form of either particles or films it can be easily packed in the system and can provide a very high catalyst density , enzyme density in the reactor system.	9.851207949329474
The costs have been brought down , the concentration of the enzyme protein which can be synthesized has gone up and this situation is changing.	11.233228956991454
So , let us compare between this two values.	6.38090605386255
Eta is given by limit c tends to 0 eta s p by c.	8.266341826725498
So , this is done with a fix shape , this tensile test is done with a fix shape , size and environment to condition and elongation at at a chosen or specified rate d l by dt.	8.232902969372155
Their bulk productions , their bulk growth is very simple.	9.467582940656836
Some of the side reactions are likely to take place in the case of the continuous reactors and the residence times are usually lesser than the soluble enzymes or the batch reactors because the advantage of the smaller residence time in the continuous reactor as well as the absence of any contamination from the enzyme protein provides you a product which is much more pure compared to soluble enzymes or an immobilized enzyme in the batch systems.	10.757857583972388
K1 k2 k3 e + s es et e + p k - 1 k - 2 k - 3 we can take a reversible system k1, k - 1, k2, k - 2, k3, k - .	6.124678389827767
In case of molecular weight , again similar order , the molecular was getting dropped or reduced with increasing temperature mostly for thermal initiated reaction then for redox reaction and for photo chemical reaction because e d is actually .	11.024872496954423
V0 = k2 [ e0 ] [ s ] / km + [ s ] both these sides you take reciprocal and you can just write 1 / v0 = km / [ s ].	8.561599396528424
And in other words you can write that gibbs free energy of mixing; gibbs free energy which is given by the difference in the gibbs free energy of the solution or the mixture and the sum of the individual gibbs free energy of the solvent and solute should be negative too , so that the solution can form continuously.	9.001723173504061
Let us have brief discussion about the third technique which is end group determination.	9.82152327040877
We have so far discussed the first three parameters we will discuss this in our future discussion on the kinetics of immobilized enzyme . we stop with this.	9.440066545245614
So , if i have a monomer like this epsilon caprolactam , i get a , by ring opening polymerization i can get this polymer.	6.8908876988074415
We can do polymerization , chain polymerization with more than one functional group as well , but then in that case like the previous case of step polymerization , it will give cross linking in the polymerization , not the complete linear polymerization.	10.750003456058979
That is if for example you take a particle let us say of one millimeter diameter; determine the reaction rate and then also take a particle let us say of ten microns or twenty microns diameter in which we assume that the pore length is very , very small.	8.925843233483786
Now , this is first possibility , where one of the monomer reactivity ratios is more than .	8.810051393183393
In case of step growth polymers you generally get a bi product formation and , but if there are example where this reaction happen without formation of bi product formation and in case of chain polymers there is no bi product formation.	9.159824392932034
It is based on the polymerization mechanism and the reaction product.	10.438315461504777
The difference between cofactors and activators is a cofactor will have to participate in the catalytic mechanism.	8.79119317382046
In this lecture , we will continue our discussion on chain copolymerization , which we began in the last lecture and the lecture before.	5.454450278849369
Therefore the activator molecules can influence the reaction rate in an enzyme catalyzed process by this simple way to modify the km value.	9.954430453314158
See you.	12.836955126085707
I will leave it to you to develop this.	8.552700742536077
So , what we will do , we will go next to nmr mass spectroscopy , and now as this all of you may be knowing that nmr is about transition between magnetic energy levels , so few thumb rules like , if the molecules is nmr or a nuclear is nmr active , if the spin number i is not equal to 0, if it is 0 then it is a it is not a nmr active.	10.425146580224471
Similarly it can also react with amino group of the lysine and give an immobilized enzyme preparation.	7.279506411405243
Now , when the structures are quite similar like this tetra fluoro ethylene and ethylene or tetra fluoro ethylene and mono chloro tri fluoro ethylene , their structures are very similar.	9.24803136249862
Similarly , we can do it for second concentration c 2 and get this value , get delta r theta excess rayleigh ratio at different angles; similarly , we get for the third solution.	10.809090793416878
This method has been used very significantly for immobilizing an enzyme called asparaginase which is used as a therapeutic agent for persons suffering from leukemia.	10.706314749050998
Another group of entrapment methods , gel entrapment method rather , is from the long chain polymers.	9.141913067381989
Now , because you have to keep this reaction for longer time , sometimes that actually posses some difficulties in terms or stability of the ingredients , the chemical species which is present and as you have seen that this is typically done at higher temperature , which means that if you keep this for a longer time , there is the possibility of the polymer x species might degrade and form colour species which is not desired.	10.46567802104994
What is the external stress you are applying during the experiment , concentration of the chemicals which are using , type of exposure , whether you are just contacting , or emerging in that particular chemical.	10.46833398343106
There are some minor mechanisms also and among the minor mechanisms one is environmental or dielectric effect.	8.698955220073604
As i mentioned earlier , that here in the rate expression for initiation reactions this monomer is appearing where in case of radical chain polymerization , monomers was not present in terms of , in the rate expression of the initiation reaction.	8.819884964897998
And if there are volatile materials then , you can add some vacuum somewhere here to remove those volatiles materials.	9.725935651947571
So , with temperature a polymer material can show different types of visco elasticity behavior from a perfect elastic to a perfect viscous behavior , within behavior of visco elasticity.	9.55707906231964
So , in case of elastic material energy is stored , in case of a fluid , energy is not stored , and it dissipated in the flow , so it a ideal viscous behavior.	8.826833977937317
Such systems also will be considered as immobilized enzyme systems.	12.860907167609689
Then , what happens is this equilibrium is shifted mainly towards this sight.	10.025464596523516
So , 90 percent conversion is not enough to give you high molecular polymer.	8.831961570255695
So , how this is possible.	7.680596518156187
So , if you have ring stability order , then you have 3 member rings , 4 member ring.	8.374638164134891
So , that we can consider the specific viscosity divide by c as an intrinsic viscosity and the molecular obtained by light scattering; there will be less error.	9.958240815620016
This term addition and condensation , this classification is originally proposed by carothers in 1929 and as name suggests , the condensation polymers are synthesized by condensation reactions of the monomers , you know condensation in organic chemistry.	9.780341771079524
The method is reversible in nature , the interactions are reversible and so operational stability is usually not very high.	8.355297331918655
There is a insertion of this new monomer; this new monomer in the alkyl carbon linkage alkyl aluminum linkage and forming again the original titanium which will now add to the next incoming monomer.	9.618500618339773
Then sensitivity; sensitivity is a function of the km value of the enzyme that means the range of analysis that it can perform that will depend on the km value of the enzyme.	8.908368222820952
Therefore we usually use it along with the adsorption method.	11.34996686900419
Unless you modify enzyme immobilization procedure whereby a spacer arm is introduced then you can reduce the steric hindrance.	10.203565109192393
And these beads should not stick to each other , if you are planning to filter the beads from the reaction medium , so it should be such that the beads should not stick to each other.	7.2934618231187835
For example , we solid - state polymerization , ring opening method , this is polymerization or group transfer polymerization.	9.703275519417412
The first form , the first complex formation can be considered as the random ternary complex formation.	7.637846269088396
For because the life time or the life time of this radicals are very small is normal user technique is not very accurate to find out the concentration or m m dot the valve of m dot.	10.597885669528525
Other case , other side you take these fibers and strain it.	10.885690750103645
If you want to terminate the reaction you can exchange these with a say adding some water or alcohol , and then you can exchange like other we discussed earlier.	9.37219409290033
Ultimately its response you get something like this with the average mean residence time of t bar.	11.725358490250827
So in many cases of intercellular enzymes efforts have been made to immobilize the whole cell itself and the immobilization of the whole cell is a desirable feature particularly in the case of intercellular enzymes.	9.504657918302227
In the gel structure you can entrap the enzyme in the gel matrices and the advantage is that the enzyme can experience almost the same kind of water activity or the environment as very close to what is obtained in the case of a living cell.	8.767947352707123
Stable refers to that the enzyme , the amino acylase from aspergillus species was isolated and one of the first enzyme which was isolated was based on methionine acylase.	12.478532684973336
We can write from this r t c ln m e and we can write , del g 0 p as del h 0 p minus t c del s 0 p this side; right side r t c ln m e.	8.576532458952936
So for simplicity what will be the i th chains , number of ways i th chains can be placed; n 0 x i would be i plus 1 is i.	10.515899403262628
What happened you basically take the sample , and applied the flame , from a particular distance , and some cotton are placed.	9.846170400829129
The next and very significant advantage of michaelis menten kinetics and particularly the significance of the km , michaelis menten constant , is very often we get an insight into the functioning of enzymes in the living cell.	9.309082774400663
And that can be written as so , we are adding a volume element here with radius of r , 4 pi r squared d r is the volume element.	10.112292568845222
If this is 0 degree then if you want to measure a 2 degree then you need to place your scatterer at very large distance having found the scattering particle.	8.991011053581941
Same here the more polar , the more intermolecular forces and more higher t g.	9.696857404673839
Now , you mainly calculate , how you find information about these and we will know the expression for this and then find out what is relation in how to get this.	9.40562323932811
So benzyl peroxide and , say n diethyl , i mean if r is ethyl group , then it reacts and give this.	11.077815495930873
That means this saturated salt solution if more water is produced will take up water and when water will get depleted it will act almost like a water buffer just like a buffer for acids and bases , this acts like a buffer and one can control water activity in organic reaction system and carry out the reaction at a constant water activity.	9.404920070775857
Now , let us talk about size.	3.745159191865958
Now , as you have seen earlier , that a propagation reaction can be this.	6.943376673133994
So , let us do it in the next page.	5.5649312097784565
So , this as a the reaction possible with different types of this is the typical or happen if your inhibitor or retardation or a combination of both of that and examples of inhibitors again this is when this radicals is very stable.	10.668238500288338
If we plot the rayleigh ratio with different angle that will give the same intensity; remember we are talking about rayleigh ratio which have cos square theta term in the denominator.	10.554843973225454
We plan to give just an overview of the techniques which can be used for a polymer determination of polymer molecular weight today.	9.911287152595945
Even after it is consumed partly the concentration drop is not very large and actually if we look into most of the hydrolytic reactions the water which is almost more than fifteen molar concentration in the reaction mixture , even after participation of water in the hydrolytic reaction , the concentration doesn t drop to significant level and therefore michaelis menten kinetics is still valid and gives you on analysis practical results.	11.16804965217376
K2 / km is a combined parameter for the biocatalysis but d is a diffusional parameter so it is physically some parameter which defines the ratio between the two and by adjusting either numerator or increasing or decreasing the numerator or the denominator one can regulate the controlling parameter.	9.715427628410454
Of course if you have a cationic then you have an anionic counter ion.	9.729264854827262
Now , let us move to the next topic of anionic chain polymerization.	3.632352708347077
Whereas ionic polymers; in case of anionic polymers mono monomers selective , it is not every state of two monomers can be utilized for , making ionic copolymerization.	11.098338092574622
For example , acrylonitrile in bulk or acrylonitrile in water in this case , it should be water.	9.042735358121034
And polymers grow in size as the absorbed monomers on this polymer molecules they get polymerized , and in this case the size of polymers are below of the size , what we achieved for a suspension polymers , say about 1 to 10 microns.	11.156591329042193
Typically or generally the tendency of this copolymerization are towards ideal behavior because when as i said that the number of monomers are limited.	11.082407408745548
That means at higher substrate concentration the reaction velocity is inhibited.	8.138436822771093
So , you have now the polymers.	5.130072655224649
It is the temperature , the highest constant temperature at which the material will survive , related to a application requirement , what does it mean.	9.050946982957836
That means to make sb - ss equal to zero , without any biochemical reaction this much of height of the reactor is required under these operational conditions.	8.671190688612876
The effect of ph on the reaction velocity must be considered as a parameter on the rate of reaction.	7.604515469210863
Now , this two term , this , this expression is not very useful because the values for x and a are not available for most cases.	8.33742950738348
So , the polymer will try to expand its chain.	6.592500147576485
So , we just discussed the propagation steps , now let us talk about different possible termination steps in cationic chain polymerization and as one more time , that it cannot , termination does not happen by bimolecular reaction of the propagating species and generally , the termination happens by transfer reactions.	8.527928121606292
So , we can plot these two.	5.420039557106096
They are somewhere between the continuous stirred tank reactors and the plug flow reactors and if you put the substrate feed at a speed high enough to lift the bed or fluidize the bed but not allow the catalyst particle to go out of the reactor , unlike in the case of a packed bed there is a static bed of the immobilized enzyme particles and the linear velocity of the feed is not large enough so that the bed can be disturbed.	9.916759408508456
Two of them must be at least binding sites and the substrate binds on these two sites to the enzyme molecule whereby it orients the substrate molecule along with the enzyme such that the reactive functional group and the reactive site on enzymes active site come in proximity or in vicinity.	11.364478341677493
Now , unless the monomers is sterically crowded or they have a easily abstractable beta hydrogen , in majority cases they undergo termination by coupling reaction like styrene , acrylonitrile , methyl acrylate.	10.314325040035774
It can even also be used along with , like your fiber entrapped enzymes , if the fibers are woven in the form of a cloth or thing like that so that you get a very large surface area in the form of a film , long film.	10.015698764021932
Now why it is important , let me you a example.	10.633539240589274
If you increase photo electron withdrawing group , then the attack of this , the nucleophilic attack of this phenolate ion becomes much more feasible which will increase the k much higher compared to a di phenol carbonate , where there was no electron withdrawing group.	9.625653192627032
By definition this should be a chiral molecule.	11.051396774299484
Let us compare another set; polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride.	8.513928018472278
But even in that case the molecule has to undergo a transition state otherwise the catalyst reaction is not feasible according to reaction rate theory.	10.119880503703417
Then the second factor is cost of carrier and reagents for immobilization.	7.935931140981851
In case of tensile testing , the tensile bar , a dog bone type specimen or a dumbbell type specimen is fixed one side and another side with a pendulum is is hit the hammered from both the side.	9.832313047507979
You can work out an expression for degree of inhibition and that will have a characteristic pattern which can distinguish a particular type of a reversible inhibition.	9.818323671521705
Because , each 2 mole kinetic chain will come and interact and form one polymer so it get 4 4 moles of polymers.	8.83158535322578
Now that will change if your counter ions are very tightly bound with the carbon atoms.	9.797908532471501
This is not energy of activation.	6.112990651811141
Riesel and katchalski in israel reported the use of urease immobilized on diazotized amino acid copolymer used for the determination of urea in urine or serum and also for the removal of urea from body fluids.	11.7226839851505
In x mar , the number of groups , a structure , x structure , also number of groups will be x.	10.71372502362064
How many b groups remaining.	11.072037512439316
So , this radius of gyration would be related proportional to the actual radius of this hydrodynamic polymer coil.	8.7309621239519
Now , to get it , we are trying to get x n bar of 10.	10.29403985645799
So , we can write n i , this is m i.	6.632668146669402
Compared to this crude enzyme where this specific activity is very low to a level where the contaminating enzyme that can disturb the process are revoked.	12.193175953197017
Now , let me tell you few numbers , the concentration of surfactant micelle say micelle and around 10 to the power 19 to 10 to the power 21 liter inverse , so per liter of this you have this many micelles.	9.529422989700572
So , you have interpenetrating network and in another case , you can have one of this network as link one of network along with long chain linear polymers.	8.779710624658808
Some industries which are making more immobilized enzymes here in house they are also importing the carrier.	9.930547808667672
Now , this nature polymers , say like cellulose , how do you define which class they belong.	8.969359595495835
And you can also crosslink to increase the load bearing capacity , even at the higher temperature but then , cross link brings other problem like a possibility with it.	8.901489747897706
So you have an advantage.	9.05812862335253
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in this lecture we are going to begin our discussion on polymer stereochemistry and then follow by our discussion on coordination polymerization.	5.4449013605555034
In the last lecture we have started our discussion on polymer molecular determination , and we actually discussed how to get the viscosity average molecular weight.	6.669238625074251
Step growth polymers , generally do not have these bonds which are very prone for degradation , but they do have the functional groups which are prone to hydrolysis , like this ester groups , amide groups , or carbonate groups.	10.810973428607383
While in case of radical we have seen , that all this , this monomers or this monomers or this can be all polymerized by radical chain polymerization.	9.399589752923532
The fourth role of ph and probably one of the most important role which ph plays and which directly influences the rate of reaction is the ionization of the amino acid residues on enzyme active sites.	8.067016510968232
We have no means to look at the adequacy or the effectiveness of our analytical procedure which we have used.	9.890493490752023
There are number of methods.	5.506450544604224
So , if you can find out intrinsic viscosity is a polymer then plot of log eta m , because this gives the polymer size and this elution volume.	8.399107467467836
If y is h or y is or , that has the least ability to stabilize this radical.	7.747124962593681
Now , if you compare different temperature , so you take polystyrene at 25 degree centigrade , and polystyrene at 70 degree centigrade; obviously , temperature goes up you expect that , the restriction for single bond rotation will be coming down , because you have more kinetic energy , because higher temperature , obviously , the rotational the restriction around the single bond would come down.	9.390956265631884
Here instead of km / s0 i plotted s0 / km.	9.740995652091334
Therefore it will become very important that we look at the concentration of substrate available for the enzymatic reaction within the pores of the reaction.	9.554055219451524
They have regular structures; obviously , isotactic will be having more regular than symbiotic structure.	9.547220470626533
This is poly acrylamide gel entrapment.	7.34376922662279
Km k2 e + s es e + p + i ki esi es can bind to inhibitor giving you esi.	7.3064951497369375
If some exothermic process goes on , then heat get evolves in the samples.	9.565182927090566
Now this complex , enzyme substrate complex formation can be effected by a number of other external molecules which are not really directly the players in the enzyme reactions.	10.041632377187508
Now , what are the factors from a polymer chemistry point of view.	8.4320175162589
And , some of the commercially available hindered amine light stabilizer results are shown here.	7.372853866806509
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
So , this would be given by the volume fraction.	6.455628540304807
So , all this will put in a , all this restriction one after on , found and then r m s end to end distance varies , and once we know the end to end distance and always find the radius of gyration.	7.914570777554674
Sometimes , the polymers are named from hypothetical monomers for example , i have this polymer are generally synthesized by hydrolysis of this vinyl , polyvinyl acetate.	10.468317087183529
So , basically they destroy them self by doing some chemical reaction , and sacrifice them self to protect the main polymer in concern.	9.377331984213374
If we talk about this expression , here we do not have any rate constant coming or appearing from initiation reaction , termination reaction and so forth the from the chain transfer reaction as well the , which mean that the rate of initiation or termination or say inivation or chain terminate transfer reactions , do not have any significant on contribution , do not affect the two copolymer composition at all.	9.977900884378315
Whereas , in terminal control polymerization , there is equilibrium , between cyclic molecules and linear molecules there is a equilibrium.	11.38995607489525
Very often we end up with kind of interactions as e + s es et e + p there are a variety of intermediate complexes that are formed not only one complex.	8.646326440259346
So , though this trend is there , now while choosing the catalyst or the coinitiator , it is , it is not this general trend is always followed , you have to keep the other factors in mind as well.	8.851978667793668
This will initiate chain , by reaction reacting with further monomers , forming extended chain , and this will progressed to make a complete polymers.	10.637170359489259
If we consider the same examples of isobutylene polymerization by bf 3 and h 2 o , this can transfer beta proton to the monomer and can form this and plus the 2 2 beta proton , one is here and one is this hydrogen.	9.683232951550364
So an attempt was made for the treatment of experimental data so as to test or verify the hypothesis that has been proposed by michaelis menten initially and verified and approved or wetted by briggs and haldane.	10.07066381784741
While if you compare with the situation where they are well separated , they are like free , free hands.	11.220790991401794
So , as you expect , that commercial applications of anionic chain polymerization are limited and they are not used for making any polymers , used for making many polymers and they are only utilized for making specifically copolymers and , and some molecular standards , where we require very narrow dispersion , which you can utilize for using standards , as molecular standards , which you can use for molecular weight determination.	10.500247108709507
Typically , the terminations happen or typical termination happens in by the chain transfer and there are several possibilities of chain transfer reaction in case of cationic chain polymerization.	9.04084871597944
So , basically there is some trial , and experiments one need to do , to find out the best possible additives for the polymer you are looking for.	7.891997919464023
And the other halogenated compounds work that way , they basically a trap the radicals , which it is basically assumed or resumed that the radicals , which basically spread the fire.	10.493278062751124
If we give next example , then that will be clear.	10.105779723691501
The four different enzyme species present here e , e a , e and e b.	9.993510300252028
Simply this aibn type molecule also can absorb photon and break into 2 radicals.	10.411762147149027
Both the binding sites are occupied and such a system can be represented by a mechanistic model whereby you have the first binding as ks either here or here.	9.068783057023444
Termination of this chain might happen by reaction between the radicals; basically , reaction between 2 radicals.	11.282356753153698
Now , second characteristics , if you want to talk about , is the effect of polarity , effect of polarity of the solvent.	9.842466099463548
Homopolymer , if you have a monomer represented by and linked with each other , then we call as a homopolymer.	10.982698333799219
So , all the advantages of bulk polymerization is remain still intact high polymerization rate , high molecular weight , very pure monomers.	9.268665734142337
In many cases numerical solutions have been found in the case of michaelis menten kinetics which indicates the effect of thiele modulus and effectiveness factor as a function of something like a dimension less michaelis menten constant which is the ratio of k m / s.	10.059593608621642
If i assume that your knowledge in polymer chemistry or other subject is related to the age , then you have some knowledge base.	10.518558319253025
So in this case , delta t is a temporary difference between the same , and the reference is plotted against the temperature.	8.325687024190026
Now , if there is external magnetic field applied to the molecule , then they can align in two different way , they can align with the external magnetic field or they can align against the magnetic field; now there is two states or energy different where this is having higher energy , then this , so this lower energy and this is half energy , less than higher energy.	10.93898459139459
A jd factor has been defined in the case of heterogeneous catalysis in general and which applies very well to even enzyme catalyzed reaction.	9.46899904178964
You simply design your reactor on the basis of biochemical reaction and be happy.	10.245449262947345
So , the polymer , linear polymerization takes place.	7.2533956606853796
You can actually explain the effect of temperature in case of anionic polymerization.	7.20364261468557
In the electrical circuit current is a very easily measurable parameter and just to make it suitable for repeated use we need to immobilize the bio element.	11.247945203932275
If you look at the energy content of the molecules it will show you a gaussian distribution.	7.721884920129056
When you write a polymer chain like this , as we saying all the time , we write polymer chains like this.	8.623520636991024
That means it will allow only substances below a certain molecular weight to pass through it.	8.474550933537854
Whereas from the bound enzyme substrate complex to go to the transition state there will be no loss of entropy and that entropy gain will account for advantage in the entropic contribution to the energy of activation and this is one of the major contribution in reduction and activation energy as a result of substrate binding.	9.848262170915119
But , it does not react with the monomers to initiate he chain molecules a new chain or if it is at all reactive with monomer the rate is very , very small which means practically in this reaction transfer reaction you are producing a death chain.	9.001378145314275
So , when you release that stress to gain that conformation entropy , it comes back to it is original state.	7.761687801160816
So increasing enzyme loading means the concentration of enzyme is being increased.	11.0202725341485
Now we have seen that this is the expression for dilute polymers , the intrinsic viscosity of polymers in dilute polymer solution and what i can find out.	9.483116237543683
Birefringence is basically , optical phenomena , which a sample exhibit different refractive indices , for differently plane - polarized light.	11.643566282943533
So , we are writing like this and again , m 0 1 minus p m 0 1 minus p which makes this.	7.939798790791854
Different methods have yielded increase in km value , decrease in km value and sometimes no change in km also.	11.012037742843669
So , if you change the feed ratio , what will be the ratio.	7.120895589828013
In most cases they do not make miscible blends , and as a results , the property of the mixture , of polymer a and polymer b , thus not give you the required property we are looking for.	8.707909063098185
And you have polymer particles , which are polymer particles plus free monomers surrounded by or stabilized by the absorption of the surfactant molecules , this has formed by the polymerization in the surfactant micelles , there are no free micelle in this time.	10.259074472293584
Under these circumstances , the concentration of eh will be eh = e - . h + / k and the total enzyme concentration e0 = eh + e - e0 = eh + k . eh / h + = eh ( 1 + k / h + ) e0 eh = = e0.h + / h + + k ( 1 + k / h + ) if we assume that eh is the catalytically active form and not the negatively charged enzyme , then the substrate will bind only to eh.	8.522884772968052
If there is a reversible reaction , these are the kind of limits like equilibrium constant will be achieved at this point and so on.	8.449074404290856
We did a calculation to find out , that m w and corresponding pdi , poly dispersity index , which is m w by m n and which we found , that it is pdi equals to 1 plus p.	10.062417193721481
They will homo polymerize.	8.32691365175394
I am going directly to the final expression of this number of ways this total number of n 2 chains can be placed in this three lattice which is number of distinguishable ways you can place the n 2 number of molecules in this sheet; it is given by the expression we just mentioned here.	9.856389123258396
The substrate will also ionize and depending upon the true ionization state of the substrate which is accepted by the enzyme at the binding site , the fraction of the substrate which will get bound will determine the ph effects.	9.5163516009629
Let us first talk about the static light scattering , because it gives many information for polymer solution.	8.120398181593112
Therefore one can get the magnitude of ki by plotting a secondary plot.	9.73061180884312
So , this hbr or hx halogenated hydrogen halides basically , trap those radicals and prevent those chemical reactions , which spread fire and they are mainly used for polymers like nylon , polyesters , styrenics and polyolefins.	10.182362728529293
Now , let us , we know , that at different state of aggregation we have discussed earlier , that this ion - pairs present in different state of aggregation forms a tight ion - pair to solvent separated ion - pair to completely free ion - pair.	7.580307246130266
So , strategies to flame resistance is , to retard combustion process in differ phase , and char formation , causing char , if you have a polymer which forms high level of char , typically halogen containing polymers , and also inorganic polymers , and sometimes added additives , which does not , ceramic additives for example , which does not burn and just go out of the system.	9.87826637453726
Now , let us discuss few features of ziegler - natta polymerization which is the mechanism , we just talked about the monometallic mechanism.	7.893819078523189
And we also introduced the term polydispersity index , which was given by m w by m n.	6.7611992158124545
What if this is positive then obviously this will form immiscible polymer blend now , to have a negative value of entropy of mixing , there should be some specific interaction between the polymers.	9.384263791306822
It will increase the reaction rate and decrease the molecular weight in a uncontrolled way.	8.97760676538563
So , in presence of external magnetic field , the nuclei can have two different energy state and now if we apply a nuclear magnetic radiation , whose energy is in this in this gap , in this range.	9.347597996522206
The composite term the k2 ( e0 ) characterizes an enzyme in terms of saturation.	13.165511038047274
The quantity of buffer that has to be administered or that has to be passed in the conventional dialysis unit is 100 to 300 lts.	11.177014277577369
Then the third parameter which is important to look at is storage and operational stability.	7.9627473719643715
And from that we can get the values of m , this one m m , r and r r.	9.605064797462497
Therefore you can get immobilized enzyme preparation which is free of any steric hindrance.	11.70680171141934
These two different situations will give you an idea , that in some cases and these are very important cases and have lot of physiological importance for the cell to have design such a enzyme which deviate from hyperbolic kinetics as we will see further.	10.545000953770264
And in today s lecture , we are going to learn lattice theory of solutions for small molecules and then learn about ideal solutions , thermodynamic probability and distribution and the boltzmann equation and then learn about polymer huggins theory of polymer solutions; these are the sub topics which we will learn during this lecture.	8.791598798179603
If you have a radical group , then it can also be stabilized by by this substituent group.	8.304458329175475
So , what is this expression.	6.958887419258243
So , the volume v h would be proportional to the r g cube; volume given by four - third pi r square , r is this r.	8.675128521711052
And if they are free that happens in a polar medium , then as we discussed now , you can consider this carbon the terminal carbon as a planar molecule; it has a planar geometry.	9.101192474845336
So , we discussed in so as a polymer chemist , you we very efficient in first two step monomer characterization , monomer synthesis and then polymerization process and characterisation of the polymers for synthesis.	9.606251206641636
So , basically in the first part , all the ingredients are added and those ingredient are mixed here , molten in this part , melted in this part and mixed thoroughly and as the screw rotates , the melt is pushed forward.	9.789787923358038
So , reaction m is 50 degree for t g this polymers as become higher than 50 degree , so no more conversation can happen; at this conversation t g of this polymer present t g of the polymethyl methyl acrylate present here at become higher then 50 degree which is the reaction medium.	9.82407532707866
Now from this fluctuation of the scatter intensity which we can apply techniques; this is like dynamic light scattering which take advantage of this fluctuation and we can get information about hydrodynamic radius for the polymer molecules and the time average intensity which we will use in the techniques called static light scattering which will give the information about absolute molecular weight , weight average molecular weight , the radius of gyration and the second semiempirical coefficient which will in turn give the information about polymer solvent interaction parameter.	9.95767348622791
On the other hand here we are using a ready made polymer.	7.310648951020957
And they are jointly awarded the noble prize in chemistry.	10.228662189479403
A very small fraction of the total volume is occupied by the enzyme preparation.	7.529954354146374
So , as p is close to 1, if your half p to a lower level than no matter what is your r , no matter what is r , whether r is 1, still you get lower molecular widths.	8.416259454322288
Now , each you can rotate , they are rotatable.	10.781487973698473
In those cases the binding of the substrate to the enzyme will depend upon the ionization state of the substrate.	7.137692690279391
We have seen a number of immobilization methods that we have discussed in previous classes.	9.78336656447768
It is substrate concentration at which the reaction reaches half of the saturation behavior and therefore it directly implies the affinity behavior and is being represented in the terms of dissociation constant.	8.97532246082135
Now for a single component polymer; say for example , there is a homopolymer we were talking about , or a copolymer immiscible copolymer , they can also scatter slightly , due to presence in special variation of ri , due to presence of some stresses , moldered stresses , or reason vision , there could be some may be very small , but small in homogenates in the refractive indices value , across different places of the material , and therefore that reason there could be slightly , slight amount of refractive index.	10.305944691098382
So , using very high energy radiation sources , we can apply or we can generate a radical , which can initiate the radical polymerization reaction.	10.502687074585868
There is a perfect control , fine tuning of the enzyme activities as per the desired requirements and we also know that the cells are energetical , in terms of material consumption are very efficient systems and wastage is minimum.	10.503610269321706
So , this is for the second segment , this is for the second segment , and this is for the third to the last segment.	7.3238015855388
And in next lecture , i plan to talk about the other type of ionic polymerization , which is anionic chain polymerization.	9.429258552343363
If you just take the same yardstick of explaining k as we have taken in the case of michaelis menten equation , v = 0.5 vm you will end up as sn0.5 = k in the case of hill s equation.	9.416219311771622
Thirdly the enzymes they used were really not available in the highly purified state.	10.47064314070708
So , that m n and m w can be equated to the m v.	6.2468023786958415
So , what would have been the end to end distance.	5.8328400083780565
And then extra plot this value to c equals to .	7.918382077580528
Let us first talk about thermal properties , we discussed about the glass transition , and the glass transition and melting behavior of polymer earlier.	9.151942013071228
People ask for banning plastics , plastic bag , plastic shoes , plastics bottle everything you know , most of the applications of polymers are referred to as a application of plastics.	11.53647396668527
And then , taken to the molding state to give the final part or extrusion techniques can be used for making final parts like , very simple parts like film , profiles like pipes , rods and so on.	8.86051557957259
So , weight fraction by total weight of the individual fraction divided by the total weight and individual fraction is given by n i m i.	8.028289763666647
So , the chain length the degrees of polymerization goes up.	6.164053091768093
This is a very important thing , that t c is not a single temperature , it , it depends on the composition of your polymerization reaction.	7.929028195002298
Either inhibitor has to bind to the enzyme or the substrate has to bind to the enzyme.	7.857138916806804
And in this case , we are seeing that the molecular goes up then critical temperature also comes down.	6.855259543027413
So , monomers , they cannot cyclize intra molecularly , but cannot they cyclize at all.	8.983308155184554
Now , what we will do in the next lecture.	3.527545813950908
They are the two classes of enzymes lipases and proteases which have been extensively studied for variety of reactions.	8.970843832001904
Now , in this case the polymers which form they are in soluble in the solvent , so in absence of dispersion they would have precipitated from the solution.	8.408646944025612
For example , we take this reaction , general reaction.	7.244316787443367
You may have either as k4.ey or you can have k3.eab.	12.53124249972549
So , you can cross link this polyester unsaturated polyester chains , so by doing this we can make a cross linked network.	9.109770716026073
Most of the enzymes , particularly the ones which have quaternary structure for their function , they will have more than one binding site on the enzyme molecule.	7.995043937221345
If a chain which has x number of structure units which means , this is a polymer of this x.	10.77068816320628
If you take the phosphoesterases and immobilize them , then you can have the base composition because the hydrolysis will yield and then you can have a controlled hydrolysis and see the sequence.	9.735554210706267
K * therefore the ke * &gt; &gt; k * and it will imply that ks * , equilibrium constant is much , much greater than ks.	9.50943208227889
So , there are 8 moles of radicals produced during this time frame , during the polymerization reaction.	7.439512615443808
So , just to clarify one more time , in case of styrene we have the styrene unit as as a repeat unit and in case of pet you have this unit away with a repeating unit.	10.09243145265063
Another example of a group specific enzyme , whereby the variety of alcohols particularly primary alcohols are oxidized to their corresponding aldehyde involve nad , nadh system as a cofactor.	10.796258311655846
We also in that kinetic polymerization proved the theory of equal reactivity of functional group.	7.488398660305788
Most of the enzymes involved in those mechanisms reduced the activation energy.	8.01047947979617
If you have a , if you want to do electro chemical polymerization or electro chemical radical polymerization , you can , you use this technique to start the polymerization.	8.35893779751943
So , what i will do , i will stop today and we will start in the next lecture.	5.430547408833107
If you do it at lower temperature , then m e value will come down and reaction will proceed till that equilibrium value of the monomer concentration.	7.9264530326907865
Many of the structural proteins will be in the extended form but most of the proteins which constitute enzymes are globular proteins and they form almost a spherical shape under ideal condition.	10.322295323641255
But monomer actually , if you increase the monomer both the reaction rate and the molecular weight goes up and this is the maximum concentration you can do.	11.814663974000998
The major objective , from the industrial point of view , of immobilization enzyme would be to reduce the cost of enzyme input into any processing per unit quantity of the product to a significant level and that is what is often achieved.	10.166994592363219
In today s lecture we are going to discuss about amorphous and crystalline states of polymers.	6.249707412051418
One is that the system undergoes a very fast rate of deactivation mainly because you have to transfer the whole material along with the substrate into the ultrafiltration module and recycle back the retentate and so during that transfer there is a significant loss occurring.	10.955553866195514
And so as m w from x w you know number average with weight average molecular weight from , weight average degree of polymerization.	8.910453148633676
Also , let n is the number of molecule present , molecules present , at the end of the reaction what will be x n.	8.929174185442832
Now given this two structure , now the fact that , this monomer which is reacting with this reactant species , which means that , whether this is radical or cat ion or anion , will get stabilized , by the substitution y present.	10.916207876470727
So , basically , trap the radicals and form non radical process , and by which they prevent degradation of molecular weight , and formation of the yellow colour bodies.	8.650415426099155
But the whole particle , as a micelle particle is immersed in the organic phase.	10.495971552595906
So , if this has to phase separate this , this solution having polymer mole fraction of this value if that has two phase separate two , two composition having polymer mole fraction correspondence to this and this , the gibbs mixing would be given by this value and that is negative.	9.183845888595245
We have considered the reactions that follow michaelis menten kinetics , the reactions that follows substrate inhibition or product inhibition; we also considered approximation with respect to zero order and first order reaction regimes in the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions.	8.612131103293297
Now , earlier , few years back for a decade back or so this spec was used to be made from glass , but now a days you will hardly find any spec is made up of glass , they are all made up of either polycarbonates or the cheaper ones are formed acrylics.	10.910677228652524
I will come to operational stability a little later.	7.1963167334385165
What is the value of x n for radical chain polymerization.	7.930361102821565
The second parameter is that the reaction must be carried out at less then ten degree centigrade.	9.379754135664985
If the enzyme activity leads to 0 or 5 % or 10 % at the end of the immobilization i don t think we should logically call it an immobilization enzyme preparation.	8.585847019857528
External agent , which are could be added added deliberately from outside or it could be present as a impurities and we call some time call as this chain transfer agent or cta.	13.085098561138981
Pulling will reduce the solubility and we will get a gel.	13.553040358453616
We will see subsequently how mass transfer and catalytic activity are linked.	9.058910195322216
Now , let us look at the whatever topic we covered in the last lecture.	5.481257870305132
For thermo sets , you do not have t g you have thermosets , you have hdt and t g , and then finally , the decomposition temperature.	11.479414679833726
So , if you know the reactivity ratios r 1 r 2, then we can get the azeotropic composition at which we can get an azeotropic co - polymerization.	8.424770009065563
So , what you finally measuring , what we finally measuring the polydispersity of the sample , which is the void of the monomer , dimmer , trimmer , which are suppose to be part of the polymer mixture , that is the reason we might get a narrower distribution.	10.627610368869854
And in classical mechanics you get e = kt h is the planck s constant , e is the energy , the.	9.488728926189847
And again we go to tarsalbutyl benzene , because again it is a primary radical , we are talking about if the tendency of transfer reaction goes down.	9.553148956413743
The gel acts almost like a thermal insulating material and therefore the temperature at this site is relatively much less as compared to the bulk temperature and therefore apparently the apparent optimum temperature will be higher than what is required.	11.166397526218223
So , a sides does not give a very accurate results of the m dot value.	8.792706741497389
Now , we are talking about radical polymerization , and what are the different types of initiator we can use.	7.322782274499718
So , you have to add this amine catalyst to facilitate the reaction and have the reaction happening in first way , no first space.	8.664107367458097
So , the degrees of polymerization will be summation of this , plus this.	7.988622183464633
So , you can add a second monomer to form a block polymer.	5.1761276212101075
We obviously can do it by cooling the molten polymer.	10.268501472231131
Say if you are your trying to polymerize a monomer and then at the end you are not able to get the h high enough molecular weight which you planned from your experiment.	11.051800281275108
It has two carboxylic groups instead of only an amino group.	8.070967080057901
Bentonite is clay with high negative charge and this attributes to an increase in the optimum ph.	10.89197770086177
In most cases they are specific interaction between polymer and solvent molecule is different than the interaction between a solvent - solvent molecule or a polymer - polymer molecules.	8.550915066282066
Applications are in the most of this has very good strength , flexibility in packed resistance and these are good melt flow behavior.	10.976766259186984
So , this a example of copolymers of pet and pbt polyethylene terephthalate copolybutylene terephthalate depending upon the ratio of these two you know which in which one will be higher or not.	9.295828917383943
E b will also have only one pattern k1a , k2, k3b and you will get e0 ( k1k2k3 a . b ).	10.533145218471581
Therefore the role of the binding of substrate molecule to the enzyme at the binding site , the substrate doesnt remain very comfortable.	10.028318050083161
That means it influences the confirmation of the other binding sites therefore altering its affinity.	8.616887715051286
So , we can ignore this for time being for if the molecular weight is high enough , so we can write.	8.21575242216389
But the enzyme is able to reduce the energy of activation to a large extent as compared to chemical catalyst and also its turn over number is much higher.	7.487013446806559
If you notice that the percentage recovery are very , very low excepting in the case of entrapment in polyacrylamide gel which resulted in the yield of over 29 % compared to amino acylase where the activity recovery was of the order of 50 % or more.	9.709733245729604
This will not lead to any product formation and whatever fraction of the total enzyme is bound in the form of ess will not participate in the reaction with the result that reaction velocity will drop.	9.99210096988641
That means the partitioning effect of the hydrogen ions between the bulk and the carrier particle depends on the nature of charge.	8.174674823508381
What do we get in hand.	10.996656444995974
Now , this dimer , the choice of reacting with itself or has a choice of reacting with any of the two monomers , if it reacted with this , so you get a bb , again aa.	10.570788679483101
So , n 0 minus x i is the number of cells which are available.	5.754233194342018
Whereas if we plot any of the first derivative of the gibbs energy function like v or h or s with any of this parameter , then we are we get a discontinuity in this plot.	10.947337670295731
So , we can write the next step.	5.450780761277299
We were looking into their characteristics.	10.228754068708005
So , this entropy of pore penetration is always negative and it becomes more negative if the polymer size grows or the pore size becomes smaller; and that is expressed by this expression where if the pore size becomes smaller a s goes up; hence the entropy becomes more negative; similarly , if the polymers size goes up this becomes higher and this entropy becomes lower.	10.098999555542829
That will illustrate the point.	8.719813519985017
This is the mole fraction of m 1 in 3 m 1 in the reaction medium , and this is the mole fraction of m 1 in the copolymer , so we can write the d m 1 plus the d m 2, 1 minus f .	7.120889240289726
This , it is , in it now this can primarize.	12.65502036287209
On the other hand when you go at.	6.3176992851195015
Either they are quite weak bonds and either they are in process of forming or breaking somewhere in between.	10.259355723978343
So , let us begin with where we left in the last lecture.	4.559140177218159
So , as you can now recognize , that it is not a very simple reaction to carry out in a large scale , in industrial scales , where maintaining all these purity , all these reaction conditions are very difficult as also this reactions are typically down.	9.079122247578665
In the case of batch processes there is no automation whereas continuous processes can be automated and which can make a lot of saving in the labor cost and running cost that means the labor cost are related by per unit weight of volume of the product are relatively low in the case of continuous reactor systems using immobilized enzyme and the processes with immobilized system can be easily scaled up compared to the batch processes which might find variations from batch to batch.	11.143064838217718
For urea , urease is the enzyme , ultra filtration membrane co two electrode , an ion selective electrode.	10.158904847117865
Now , each point , each point in this represents a particular t c and corresponding m e value , which means , that t c is not a singular number , it varies along with your free monomer concentration.	8.390215497742387
So , the chemical engineer will come to a chemist that you design a reaction by which you can increase the key.	8.727103946738085
And then and next set of lectures we found how to characterize the polymers in solution , including the how to determine the molecular weight of the polymers.	8.139874353090816
The net ph profile may be a sum total of all the effects and they can be broken down into linear segments and each linear segment will represent the ionization of one of the amino acid residues.	9.699403228011908
For example , if we are talking about two blocks , then , if they are not miscible to each other or other way invisible to each other , then you have two phases.	8.631524289017602
It is only the change of addition of transition metal compounds along with this alkyl aluminum.	9.237583074322611
This is 93 kilo g per mole and this is 155, compare this with this vinyl acetate.	9.806684432411597
Most of the hydrolytic enzymes isomerizes or often can be analyzed using classical michaelis menten kinetics.	7.213754174553673
Both the x and y could be aldehyde like in the glutaraldehyde.	10.651609806517452
In that case , what is the consequence of that presence of the condensate on the molecular weight of the polymer and then , we will move to the different strategies of how to control the molecular weight in the polymerization.	8.187943492474655
In case of absence of any cyclization , just pure linear , linear chain formation we have seen the carother s , carother s equation from earlier lectures , that x n is 1, 1 over 1 minus p.	9.110017739975572
Only when a strain is developed the reaction takes place and the reaction takes place with the suitable degree of specificity introducing to it.	8.766854726017133
If you want to plot this expression you get v / vm = sn / k + sn you can simplify this to get nlogs + log ( vm - v ) / v = log k log v / ( vm - v ) = nlogs log k if you make a log log plot of log s verses log v / vm - v , you must end up in a straight line with the slope of n and on log log plot you will straight get a slope and get the number of binding sites.	8.44406650136419
We write m; we write r for this.	8.579677923670157
One of the most conventional and simplest examples could be hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose by invertase.	8.048212582262565
You get an average of 100 and what you have both the sides and you also may have some monomer present.	9.853794256043187
So , during the molding process , they actually migrate to the surface and they prefer to be in the surface , which actually is very detrimental from the products properly point of view.	9.562217503559422
So , by this mechanism , this is the mechanism by which this organic light stabilizers function as a photo stabilizer.	9.043756384260467
Dx / dt = k1e s k - 1x - k2x = k1 [ e0 - x ] s k - 1x k2x now you can separate the variables x and t in this equation and ultimately therefore you can write.	11.394217771947815
They can form a insulating char on the combustion substrate and thus , by stopping or preventing supply of further fuel to the fire.	9.31888411125912
Similarly if you want a covalent binding you need a carrier which possesses certain functional residues which can be coupled to the enzyme.	9.461250973058894
Either it is a plug flow motion or it is a completely back mix and nothing in between.	12.000124715315819
That is the phenomena we still understand , now with our detailed understanding of enzyme kinetics today.	9.314923480937557
And as you can , you can visualize or you can explain that because there is no termination reaction and the generation of initiator or the initiation is much faster , the concentration of this anion , anionic species are much higher than a radical polymerization.	9.385714090660477
So , i write 2, and this is what the rate of polymerization is.	9.482866597090716
Now fortunately , there is a , this two term root mean square end to end distance and root mean square or radius of gyration are mathematically related.	9.638534915796987
So , no more increase in the number of particles , hence no more increase in the rate of polymerization , so that is the end of stage ii a stage i.	9.578040973168637
In last lecture , we started our discussion on polymer properties , and their evaluation.	7.677494629321136
So , we know the value for k; and we know the concentration term here now delta i r theta.	9.080333657577544
Similarly if it is a sphere the radius is the major dimension which is important here in terms of x and therefore one needs to consider only half the particle for getting an analytical solution for the substrate concentration profile.	11.817785331835607
As matter of fact only those enzymes which are required in bulk , when i say bulk i am referring to at least , if not tons , quintals many of them in tons really , they cannot be produced on a mass scale and their availability for commercial applications is limited.	9.963780635464863
In that case , the reverse reaction would start taking place; that means , polymers will start unzipping.	9.997591615236505
Can kinetic parameters also undergo some apparent change.	13.634416914525373
Or in other words as.	8.05108676010271
How can , what are the types of side reactions.	11.623466818023948
One of the amino acid is ionizing and the other is not in a very highly ionised state and therefore you got a broad ph.	9.001260326557505
So , which it gives you close to .	10.446730165407704
The entropy actually comes down because of structuring of the water molecules this hydrophobic groups.	9.820746768721492
So , n a is the number and if they are going termination by coupling so it is two of them produce one chain.	9.147640513273368
The term k2e0 was saturation reaction rate when all the enzymes were saturated with the substrate that is bound to substrate.	9.88853100035988
So , this copolymer has improved solvent resistance property compared to polystyrene , but acrylonitrle is also brittle so poly acrylonitrle.	9.28910097814228
This is an extension of koshland s induced fit hypothesis which we discussed when we were talking about the specificity and how the enzymes obtain their specific action.	8.990631347364525
If you are talking about the plastic material , obviously you are talking about a , you are thinking a plastic material or polymer material , when light travels through the , a polymeric material what happens.	8.42816364864848
And again going back to the flory - huggins expression flory - huggins equation , this is gibbs energy of mixing.	9.608493784083867
And from this particular sample it is seen that it is seen that , if you go back and look at that nmr spectra in the computer screen , this this r r is the maximum compared to the other two other two signal.	9.911854601191424
And in this lecture i plan to continue the discussion on chain transfer reaction and their implications.	9.635232355445059
So , it is very difficult to get accurate measurements of i theta for those cases.	6.084022776368151
He said that you form a cyclic reaction mechanism and write down the pathway for each of the enzyme species or for example we can take any simpler case let us take probably the simplest case e plus p.	10.234679193490924
Medical applications like pipettes , petry dishes and medical containers and so on.	9.237230598800283
So , in this case , the entropic parameter is negative.	4.792768096585504
Or in other words you can have e again going to ea and then this ea can then convert into ey releasing a product x and then this ey can give you back e releasing another product y and you can have k1, k - 1, k2 and k.	9.504174074533761
Fourth is we must do is accurately epr solution.	11.984119120286918
Poly tera hydrofuran can be synthesized or the cationic ring opening polymerization of tetra hydro furan polyacetals are synthesized by cationic reopening polymerization of trioxane.	12.74682442270739
Now , as you can imagine , that if you have a polymer chain or oligomer chain having 14 or higher carbon atom or other atoms in , in the , in the backbone , now this is , this trend is valid for , not only for rings having only carbon atom in the ring , but it also valid for the rings where you have heteroatom , like say for example , ethers or esters or amides as well.	9.810193149729484
Now , let us come to a specific example.	5.65702193330333
Therefore you can write such a reaction mechanism as e , es and et.	9.015725317014343
So , just discuss about the transmission and talk about haze.	9.271324831103387
And as we have seen that t g plus sometime 150 centigrade at t m plus 50 degree centigrade or even more , and under shear , in case of processing with applying this melds and mixed to with , so does in case of molding , which mean that is undergoes polymer might degrade , and decompose of those conditions.	9.967688283396411
So , this is the way , you can basically change , if your semi crystalline material , you can increase the crystalinity to increase the load bearing capacity of the material.	8.318798650829136
So that is almost a proven fact and that is one advantage we have to take of immobilized enzyme for all operational purposes.	10.897668789467529
So each method will have some limitations on the choice of carrier and therefore the cost of the carrier.	8.966013153903349
The basic concept is that we can analyze amino acid composition of proteins by using immobilized proteases or base composition of nucleic acids if we use immobilized phosphatases.	10.143985664250446
The entire enzyme is not bound to the substrate here.	10.238989902986418
We can write number of monomer that polymerized , divided by the number of radicals that initiated polymer chain.	9.216728996874213
The first binding site is free for all the substrate molecule and once this is bound if it makes a change on the confirmation of the other binding sites such that the affinity of the substrate to the binding site gets altered , if you want a positive favorable effect , the affinity must increase or the km value must decrease , dissociation constant must decrease.	10.317196851451216
If in case you are handling with a different kind of a reaction scheme let us say one mole of substrates goes into two moles of products then accordingly one has to make a change in the definition of x as well as p.	10.636599756705111
So , in case of step growth polymer or step growth polymerization process the polymers are formed in various stages , no , steps first di , tri , tetra , if you stop reaction , step growth reaction after sometime before completion what will you get in the polymerization medium.	9.343336700749314
So , basically this is considered a perfectly reflecting material.	6.40163865643162
On the denominator you have d.	9.327880628015539
You get an activated matrix and the activated matrix then can react with the amino group of enzyme and give you the enzyme bound to it and the ammonia can be released.	9.618445488495112
Then the characteristics feature is physical - chemical characterization which means the biocatalyst shape , mean particle diameter or wet particle diameter.	10.627414159729028
So the new monomer , the incoming monomer can approach from only one single side.	8.515955709567361
With a further increase in the chain polymer side chain , they do not contribute too much in the restriction of the bond rotation; whatever restriction have been imposed in the bond rotation , they have done by first few atoms.	10.403122838851528
There is no problem and d - amino acids are used as a raw material for many of the keto acids which are used as a raw material in pharmaceutical industries.	9.413711386815708
So no supporting structures are required and therefore they are very simple and they find a very common application in the small scale experimental studies.	11.146915354532613
So if we consider delta g of melting , delta g of a processes , we can write t d s m.	9.765339568470495
All this time , all this propagating radical is spending same amount of time in this form.	8.675735166225921
Immobilize cells very often in the enzymes are intercellular.	14.86972655173816
The enzyme substrate inhibitor complex , the triple complex , can be arrived at either from this route or from this route because the binding of substrate and inhibitor do not interfere with each other.	9.078773695046175
For example , if we are going to make a plastic material or polymer material , which are intend to be a optically clear applications , then the plastic part or the polymer part has to be transparent.	10.509662126692275
So , m 1 will only react with m 2 star , and m 2 only react with m 1 star , only the cross propagation happen , which means you have copolymer of this type.	9.326556617954125
And as osmosis , the pressure of the polymer solution side goes up and this excess pressure here; this excess pressure and this residue are called the osmotic pressure.	10.203098918017284
Similarly the catalytic surface to volume ratio is also fixed once an immobilized enzyme preparation is available.	8.894241130318944
Obviously , we know which are the monomers we have used for making the polymers , so we have a priory some idea about the nmr spectra , so basically , this confirms that the polymerization has taken place.	10.609790468172957
So , if you take a particular composition and polymerize , then we will get always the same concentration or same composition of the co - polymers.	8.04447496587425
Because most of the enzymes which people understood very well were the membrane bound enzymes and they noticed that in the membrane bound enzyme there was some kind of a physical coupling between the enzyme and the insoluble membrane as a matrix.	9.818067764456822
Whether they can take part in the transfer reactions and you have to rule out the possibilities , if you rule out all the possibilities have the transfer reactions by appropriate choosing the initiator and the solvent.	11.562560596617566
So , obviously , with more and more time the reaction goes , this will come down and this will go up as the molecular weight also goes up , so this means that not only using proton proton nmr spectra we can get the molecular weight of the first polymer , but also we can monitor the this is a spectra from fluid sample.	10.179666213485172
So , the solution properties of the polymer chain and light scattering behavior as well is mostly dictated by the radius of gyration value; and is also useful , if you have more than one ends like if you have branched polymer then you have more than two ends , then which , end to end distance is not existing.	10.182244918105216
So , del g m which is gibbs free energy of mixture would be del h m minus t del s m; we get k t n 1 ln x 1 plus n 2 ln x 2 or r t n 1 ln x 1 plus n 2 ln x .	7.461129850412402
And because the monomer concentration inside these particle are almost remain constant , so the polymerization rate remain almost constant , throughout this stage ii.	11.4112429001518
Because partly you have already taken up that path.	11.468653773903128
So , the destination are the initiation reaction is very slow k p is first.	8.810856894308124
And you know , that anionic polymerization is very susceptible to impurities , whereas radical chain polymerization are also sensitive are susceptible , but not to that extent of this ionic polymerization.	9.008834618740472
You can just put p equal to zero that means this term will disappear whole of this term will disappear and the rate expression will become for a irreversible reaction step.	9.182403317906
In this case , there is distribution with the maximum.	8.339752228096485
In a sense these molecules make dynamic complexes with the enzyme which have different catalytic properties to that of the native enzyme.	8.760041208539281
That means the fluid dynamics in the reactor whether it is a back mix system or its a plug flow system does not influence the reactor performance as long as the reaction is in the zero order regime or the concentration of the substrate is much , much higher than the km value and you must appreciate that if it is in our limits we will always like to use a very high substrate concentration.	8.76463327421769
So , what happen is only at the last , at the end of the polymerization , you will see a long polymer chain are forming , unlike the chain polymers where you have even a small conversion , you get a larger polymer.	8.304532452653307
It can be done by electro initiation where cationic species is formed by electrolysis of any species present in the medium or it can be done by ionic , ionization radiation , like in the case of radical the initiation can be done by ionization.	9.409580127870209
The process in this direction is not feasible.	9.11074514169051
It doesn t have any mechanism to recognize the free enzyme.	7.267502567644909
If you increase the polarity further then cis product will become lower and lower increasing the polarity of the medium.	6.358574879937897
So , number of a molecules reacted a functional group reacted is p into n a.	7.870529836302482
So , we know this , so we know this we know this if we both are known then obviously k t is known and k t is known k p is also known , so this is the logic.	9.339605457005353
So at the interface of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomer they polymerize and the enzyme gets entrapped into and these microcapsules are very fine in size.	10.322727676998037
If you have an anionic then you have a cationic counter ion.	7.966786845109467
They have tried to mimic the activity of chymotrypsin; they have named it also benzyme and some of the functional groups are covalently coupled which are functional in the case of catalysis and such a complex is called a synthetic enzyme.	10.082635162394848
If the volume of the transition state is higher than the monomer volume then del v activation volume will be positive.	8.781804481926327
That is only a special case of a bi - substrate reaction under which the km apparent for b will become equal to kb when these two become equal.	8.434213580521085
So from the dissociation constant you can get the t half value , and these dissociation constant also , or the bred constant for dissociation reaction , also depend upon the temperature , where you are doing your reaction.	10.904013409615786
On the other hand if the entrapped preparation is like a micro capsule which also consist of a semi permeable membrane boundary the permeability of the membrane must be such that the enzyme molecules are not allowed to be leaked out while the substrate and the product molecule can pass through easily.	8.334800895851211
Cocatalyst are nothing but small inorganic compounds , like say h 2 o , can be observed in case of ionic polymerization have , which was not the case of radical polymerization.	11.429754504693715
Now , if this subscript f , we are mentioning for a freely rotated chain or a freely jointed chain , freely jointed chain; that means , it does not , freely jointed chain does not have any restriction or bond angle and bond protection.	10.20169207923258
Because conversion is defined the fraction of functional group has reacted , in this case , a present in a small amount.	11.699313587436569
Physically one can conceive the . . . diffusional resistances in the form of very small fine particles to that of the particle which are of larger diameter where the substrate concentration gradient becomes quite severe.	11.75430002499995
If you require small amount , then you can utilize this anionic polymerization or cationic polymerization , especially anionic polymerization , which are very useful to making block copolymer go with this.	10.251679250554389
He said that the substrate has a rigid conformation with its binding sites and the functional site or the reacting groups present at a particular conformation.	11.160612209572152
Still we depend on the natural design on the enzyme active site for all practical purposes.	9.871799877368924
May be some times water activity and all those parameters are maintained constant.	11.814498933517411
So , again one more monomer comes and the cyclic four membered cyclic transition formation takes place and the monomer gets inserted in the titanium carbon bond.	7.379673027845903
Melt state , there are two three techniques mainly , extrusion , molding , thermoforming , by which the polymer converted to final specimen.	12.503918332861323
So , radical chain polymerization as we can see from our discussion that radical chain polymerizations are comparatively easiest to carry out in respect or in comparison to the step - growth polymerization; provided you take care of the solvent , if you are using a solvent and any impurity which can terminate the radicals or any impurities which can act as a chain transfer agent.	10.296863431957492
The boundary conditions in such a case will be x = l and s = ss.	10.972144453607271
Let us see what happens when we consider an enzymatic catalysis.	7.2560919462038385
In most cases analytical procedures was not available to quantitatively measure the concentration of product.	8.893169412409115
So , if this photo polymerization method or the radical polymerization by photo initiators sometimes can be used , has a advantage; this can be used or it is used to apply or used to make polymers in a local or in a , whatever targeted part.	11.072711051763568
Lot of issues about the function of the enzymes within the cell can be understood and inferred from the kinetic analysis of the enzyme.	10.116250847153855
If there are significant differences in the reactivity of the two diols then there will be a blocky nature in the copolymers.	8.245624735947223
Now , in case of radical reactions , these copolymer reaction rates would depend on like resonance , resonance stability of the monomers or the substituent , which is present.	9.007120355967379
Therefore the nature of activator molecules might differ from case to case.	10.132110933549498
Will be identical but the rate profile will be different.	9.429197647343084
The input in the reactor going is only f1q.	14.317940906557844
Now , if at this movement the the medium viscosity is quite high what happened if the if the medium viscosity as become very high , so that the chains are not diffusing at the same rate when the viscosity was lower.	9.435788592851543
There are minor modification in terms of automation and macronization of these methods which are available today commercially but the basis is to determine the nitrogen content in any given sample which gives you an estimate of crude protein in the sample.	9.854428856352872
This expression can be written eta s p minus half eta square.	10.670037527127954
We considered all the numbers all the molecules present in at the end of the polymerization which includes monomer dimmer oligomer and everything.	10.028673906646306
The unique part is the parameter p is a fixed parameter and depends on the chemical nature of the substrate and the matrix.	8.924369785591443
Now , let s talk about few characteristics of a ring opening polymerization , and talk about the mechanism and kinetics of a ring opening polymerization.	6.4537709402690595
Such a perception in the earlier days was based on a very limited understanding of the enzyme structure and function and the limited understanding was that people had looked at the stability of the enzyme in water miscible solvents say for example acetone which is still used for precipitation of enzyme proteins; it makes aggregates and precipitates; dioxanes which are water miscible solvents and beyond certain concentration of these solvents in the bulk medium inactivates the enzyme.	10.578409653460914
Let us say a substrate has to undergo reaction which has three functional group represented by r , r or r.	8.880203392806278
The concentration of e will be given by this factor.	7.242843198952928
Even for example in the case of a cstr people have immobilized the enzyme on to the base of the and carryout the reaction.	7.589942114228873
Now , same monomer can be synthesized from condensation of 6 amino caproic acid , you can get the same polymer which were shown here.	8.061119731613053
So , this is the number of cells where we can place the next polymer molecule which is i plus 1th , i plus first.	7.601478554924832
So , this one example; is a very good example to discuss about polymer degradation and stabilization.	9.615725386292711
So , we will visit , we just this we will just begin with that in the next lecture and complete at the module on step growth polymerization by looking at the synthetic procedure of the several step polymers.	8.885031416611609
Es e et let us say this is your sk1, k - 1, k2, k - 2, k3 and pk - .	10.03454493633823
This is a typical case of a non - competitive inhibition.	5.92876097812599
So , you might consider chaining the catalyst or even reducing catalyst amount in the reaction.	7.484009425838509
You have the hydroxyl acids which correspond to some size and you may also have , we will also have some unreacted monomers as well.	9.67316742548599
Right . they are the same.	9.946625136221297
So , same thing p e m .	7.419250101475668
One is that they give you a picture on the reaction rate in the presence of those molecules.	8.132863881879643
These are difficult to align.	10.946496811142186
We also talked about suspension polymerization , in last lecture we will let us start with suspension polymerization once again in this lecture.	9.33732718579893
For example normalization in this case is c bar is equal to c / q if q is the total quantity of a stimulus given and then its response is monitored over the period of time and q is the total quantity of the input that is given and therefore zero to infinity c bar dt is equal to zero to infinity c / q . dt.	8.918668997876376
Another very significant equation as far as enzymes as processed via catalysts are concerned is between availability and applications.	10.151782662531453
Logical because of the thickness the mass transfer tends to be more.	14.794945737148304
The reactivity is very low because they cannot stabilize the radical the propagating radical so their reactivities are low so q values are low.	10.007386855142983
As long as m 1 is remaining in the reaction medium , they will form alternate copolymer , but once m 1 is consumed , even if there are free m 2 present in the reaction medium , they cannot undergo homo polymerization because r 2 is .	9.940191925279928
Pk - 1, k - .	12.868443343059875
Large variety of relationships with respect to ph for the quantity adsorbed has been found.	13.213608463044785
If this comes out , then you get a chain end with ch .	11.588146680363
We will start with polyester and just example we will take is the most important and most used polyester poly ethylene terephthalate.	9.451367249693398
L less than one that means a thin flies or smaller particles reaction rate of the immobilized enzyme will be proportional to enzyme loading.	9.263297324947112
One made for condensation reaction or it has functional group in the backbone or it can be degraded to hypothetical monomers from which they can be synthesized.	9.65017263897868
In the case of the two types of reactor , the reactor productivity is directly linked with the fractional conversion and as it is also linked with the tau , inversely propositional to tau if the tau increases the productivity goes down.	8.928918340520184
One is that we have to synthesize them.	8.634721767278068
So , the path length between the scatterer and the detectors for this techniques is much longer.	8.696412706914865
So , if you want to compare reactivity of different monomer to a particle particular radical say , if you in this case , if i fix this radical , this polymer radical or propagating radical , let us fix this and then if i want to compare different monomers , how the reactions will look like.	10.196704014801464
So , in those cases , it is useful to use the radius gyration is more useful; whereas , in there , the root mean square end to end distance is more useful for describing the rubber elasticity behavior of a polymer coil.	8.459726956088604
That means can be used in the protein molecule or enzyme molecules as biochips in the computers.	10.443223887414593
For example we take e and consider all the possible pathways by which e is formed in this cyclic manner.	9.223751985526098
The enzymes are able to bring down or reduce the energy of activation to a very large extent compared to chemical catalyst and we will again see how this is done.	8.965215647257834
So therefore an alternative analytical method has to be chosen and if you look at analytical methods the best way is to look under steady state reactor performance.	9.431473244417667
So , number of a group will be also x.	7.663558946735036
But if you consider the overall productivity of the immobilized enzyme that means the yield of the immobilization after considering the operational stability it still remains a desirable method.	9.997703005426814
So , this is the only one distinguishable way you can arrange a pure solvent or a pure solute.	7.28907966654266
Preparation like this are made in the form of thin films and then to give the stability they are crosslinked and after it is crosslinked it becomes a permanent.	11.363934869693365
That means you make a mass balance across the reactor , simplify it and the final reactor performance equation for this case for cstr is xs0 + km ( x / 1 - x ) + s20 / ks ( x - x2 ) = k2e.	7.765289058907861
In the case of the non - competitive inhibition , the turn over number will be unaffected as far as the kinetic parameter is concerned.	6.611708546975755
Now think about , that you making packing material out of polymers; for example , if you taking perfume bottle.	12.295241728067001
It undergoes termination reaction both by coupling as well as by disproportionation reaction , and as we increase the temperature , the fraction of termination fraction of disproportionation termination increases as we increase we increase the temperature.	9.246562765541022
For such a simple case the rate expression can be written as v / vm = s / ks + s2 / ks2 1 + 2s / ks + s2 / ks2 consider that the enzyme molecule has binding sites on both the sides , s and es.	9.301017572809094
So , the crystalline come down and once the crystalline come down , the density of polymers also come down.	7.8144705816713955
You then don t have to bother about the biochemical reaction because in that height reaction would have already taken place.	10.041163417744519
It increases elastic modulus , it increases with crystallinity of a semi crystalline polymer and if we add this glassy additives like glass fiber then , yield state increases.	10.338903743593333
And the other way also you should restrict or minimize the acid chloride hydrolysis , because if it hydrolyze and form a plane alcohol , then it will just acid chloride if it hydrolyze to form simple acid carboxylic acid.	10.19124746702693
Then , you have to take out the polymer from that monomer mixture and restart the polymers and so on.	7.249805226016606
So , you can use ultem as your material; obviously , these polymers are costly , because they have , so high performance and they are also difficult to synthesize there are the same time much costlier then the common polymers.	9.136399347932137
When it forms two radicals , this radical commonly known as tempo.	12.107954690674406
That is another major significance of the michaelis menten kinetics.	5.225958305548592
So , if you compare same structural design and the shape materials , the higher the elastic modulus or with the stiffness , rigidity is the ability to carry stress without changing dimension , basically.	8.81057278362604
That is a very important property which we must keep in mind when we look at enzymes for a variety of functions.	9.560243900571077
And this is again using the same examples , the chain transfer to counter ion.	8.190728311151455
It goes up and for instance after 13, it comes down in strain.	11.569870072858757
So , this is nothing unusual , so you should expect this being.	7.96831756976391
Both the cases , the molecular weight drop , with , with increase in temperature , but if there are transfer reaction going on , then the drop will be much more compared to situation where is , when there is no transfer reaction.	9.112455713149668
So only in case of dilute solution , you can consider only up to; these higher terms you can neglect.	14.322163633325706
For example , this reaction; long back , by this 2 scientists , it was shown that this reaction , this esterification reaction becomes independent; the rate of this in , esterification reaction becomes independent , when x is greater than equals to 3; which means , the reactivity of coh group is independent of the chain length.	9.477853151326208
And also it would vary on depend it would vary on various methods , we have utilized to determine this values.	10.187046344817373
Another example of substrate inhibition is in the form of succinic dehydrogenase which catalyzes the interconversion of succinate to fumerate , a reaction which catalyzes the formation of a double bond.	9.27397222907616
V h is proportional to the radius of gyration to the power 3 and radius of gyration can be written as the expansion factor and radiation gyration for the unpart of chain.	10.183739638227253
That means the . . . on the key are exactly fitting to the site at which it has to interact with the lock.	9.687773195794609
One of the characteristic features of this reaction and for which it has been used and valued is that you can adjust the distance of the enzyme from the matrix what we often name as a spacer arm.	10.43066210203208
Here also the same situation will apply that these effects of approximation will not be very , very significant if you are talking about unimolecular reactions.	9.713303758194064
Most of statistical copolymers are random copolymers , but not always.	9.55808640032345
It s only an apparent change in the monitoring system because we are measuring in the bulk and therefore the two effects are noted.	11.358303259890791
The two factors on which the classification of enzyme reactors can be based are on the mode of charging and discharging of substrate and product stream and also physical configuration.	8.999225185497204
At the end of the cycle of the operation of an immobilized enzyme preparation , if the carrier can be regenerated it is desirable even if its cost is high.	7.895548743606705
The organisms that are found under very extreme conditions are exceptions but most of the organisms that live under ambient conditions produce or they provide us enzymes which can function under mild reaction conditions.	10.042798592833389
If you consider here input to the system is f . s and this input i am writing at the entry of the differential element and output , not at the entry of the reactor , is equal to f ( s + ds ) and the disappearance of the substrate by the reaction will be the continuation of the reaction to the disappearance of the substrate is v . ( dv ) under these conditions one can write the material balance under steady state assuming that the accumulation is zero.	10.255503264099529
In most of the subsequent analysis of the kinetic parameters or the reaction rate or the reactor design to simplify the situation we often either go to the zero order design or go to the first order design very often because this expression is comparably much more complex to analyze rather than a zero order or first order design.	10.236956937325653
So , this composition is corresponding to f 1 azo.	8.024571388204363
It will harden and occupy or get the shape you are looking for , a similar like a wax where you melt it and when it cools; it takes up the shape of the container.	9.650495308321641
How we can use the knowledge from solubility parameter and we can estimate or predict the solubility behavior of a polymer in a solvent.	8.802685003560876
Now , look at point here any point between this two line this point and this point and this point and this point.	6.296718481017158
So , extreme care should be taken to remove this o 2, co 2 type impurities.	9.604482874832305
Now we can have similar sort of tacticity in case of in case of polymers where we do not have all carbon backbone.	9.813204745432822
So , because of this restriction , you can now understand that the end to end distance or time average end to end distance , root mean square end to end distance will increase from here to here.	7.201345532278698
So , that actually helps the activity and the stereo specificity.	7.983836853762766
I write va.	12.853673333770402
So , basically these are the ligands.	7.899839440857885
Now , what is the mechanism , you have bpa bisphenol a present in the aqua solutions of sodium hydroxide , so you have phenolate salt.	9.759987829785432
So , the collision frequency between the 2 molecules , 2 oligomer in this case , we will; understand; i am talking about the collision frequency between the two molecules.	8.069320233687646
Particularly if you assume k2 as the turn over number and we mentioned that the value ranges from 10 - 10.	12.18970124464998
So , if you consider this case the reaction happens like this.	5.585515679466256
That is because we have , in a small ring we have more ring strain and torsional in a big chain you have a torsional strain as well.	10.344872464192896
In case if the fraction of conversion required is very high if you are looking for a 99 % conversion , it will be desirable to use a plug flow reactor with a partial recycle.	9.79080286867854
And again , the specific volume will decrease with the decrease in temperature , but in a much slower rate than it was in case of liquid state.	9.26044190312088
The changes can be of various nature.	10.729526361244512
In the hypothesis of the transition state stabilization it is stated that the unfavorable interactions available at the active sites on the substrate favors the distortion of the substrate in such a way that the final enzyme substrate complex approaches the structure of that of transition state.	8.888144671035008
Now , that so we talked about the t c and the values of del h and del s.	7.405548125213524
So , let us stop for this class this lecture now , and we will start from this page in the next lecture immediately.	6.924195570759542
Therefore the specificity constant relates initial reaction velocity to the concentration of free enzyme rather than the total enzyme.	10.748563809667354
In fact one of the major scientist working in this area he has called these as rocks in the organic solvent.	7.550322258736443
So , r p similarly can be obtained in k p i yz.	9.47310740425842
Very often for small scale operations you can have this stirred tank with jacket for temperature control.	10.41774128827137
What will be the kind of the double reciprocal plot.	10.845982933510431
And one including what is the fundamental differences in interfacial polymerization they utilize the very first reaction of diacylchloride or diacylchloride.	11.735730012332715
Next set we move to poly aromatic polyimides , these are formed by reaction with diamine with dianhydridedi , an aromatic dianhydrideso aromatic diamines are reacted with aromatic dianhydrides , and first this is formed then one cyclization this is this imides are formed these are again very high performing polymers they are used for applications requiring very high temperature and they are known in under the trade name of captain and.	10.761146481188893
The third point which one must look at before studying the actual enzyme kinetics is some of the historical perspectives that have gone into the study of enzyme kinetics.	9.51092977702015
If the substrate concentration is high at the surface the reaction rate is low.	8.549905875873357
If you increase to a higher level desorption also might start.	8.742108040006938
Many of the enzyme reactions which are highly isothermal , i am just comparing the two , although they are known to be in all broad range as isothermal reactions they will have some value of.	10.470527256370504
They are based on platinum cathode and a silver anode which is immersed in saturated kcl which is separated from the test solution by a ptfe membrane.	9.447852688492716
The km value will be altered because the apparent concentration of substrate which we are providing is not the true substrate concentration which is interacting with the enzyme and it may be lesser than that because the ionized state which is catalytically acceptable to enzyme is less than that.	10.465664423313164
I will finish of , for this lecture at this moment.	10.113628862742432
So , we will not have at all any polymers , so polymer is get inhibited.	8.599910334538876
The second reaction is also a negative free energy change and therefore it is also carried out and the net reaction is the sum total of the two reactions , what we have shown here.	9.396890156346034
You need instrumentation for monitoring and control of the reactor , you need the concept of electronics particularly in some applications like biosensors , enzyme will require transducers and the ultimate is biochips.	10.891515955187117
If you know k h , you also will know intrinsic viscosity , then you will know from the expression you can get that molecular weight.	8.992043545611264
For example in the packed bed reactor if the particles are not of uniform size and the packing is not uniform there might be some channeling with the result that a part of the fluid stream which is getting into the reactor passes through unreacted and therefore the performance can deteriorate.	9.598561214406928
Let us first draw.	10.075484978183313
Now , in the last lecture we talked about different factors contributing to the reactivities of this the monomers and in turn the reactivity ratio the value of the reactivity ratio of these monomers.	10.090946273666473
That means the sizes of the polymer chains are smaller.	7.849762836709008
Therefore the final reaction product usually is an equilibrium mixture of glucose and fructose where the fractional conversion is only 0.4 or 0.45 not even 0..	10.387590245048248
This will be a maximum reaction velocity when a becomes saturating.	10.276018864424216
This is the mechanism which is very often employed even in the case of chemical catalyst.	7.581818474212269
Now , other branching parameters , you can also define is the intrinsic viscosity of branched by linear , we will have more discussion on that or the hydrodynamic radius of the branched divided by the linear ones.	10.621739852629176
Lead salts also act as acid scavenger; and , they , basically are one of the major additives used in pvc industry.	12.12191127772693
So , what we will discuss here in this lecture , we will basically talk about two mechanisms.	7.899430865131605
So magnesium is something on interface.	11.423592864010187
That means irrespective of substrate concentration in the reactor the inactivation rate is constant and which can be given by - de / dt = kd . e a first order decay rate constant that is what we are familiar with.	10.290067892985828
Here , we only change this ( c h 2 ) 4 backbone with a much stiffer backbone , which basically restrict the rotational freedom around this chain , which makes the polymer backbone much stiffer.	10.46347392706689
R p also you know this k p mm dot.	11.398401006200087
Buffers were not a very common tool to be used in the kinetic analysis.	10.645668135935903
Obviously , as you have seen this temperature plays a more important.	8.535870850111277
This was given by hill.	11.400283304237425
Ideal situation could be to consider a non - porous particle , where all the enzyme will be on the surface and the sole diffusional limitation is as a result of transport through the thin film.	9.622087539184431
Similar applications will come here for biology also.	11.406725148144142
T temperature of the solution must be fixed otherwise , you might get.	12.510378297172755
Typically , you have a pi bond , is converting to a sigma bond during this chain polymerization , or which is starting from a double bond.	9.45040652942821
So , what happened.	3.3923006055986513
This as you know , this , this is the standard enthalpy of polymerization reaction and this is standard entropy of the polymerization and this is standard state for monomer is considered.	11.530726909696627
So , if it forming a and b is forming a completely random statistical copolymer , then the percentage of these 3 carbonate peaks would be 25 percent 50 percent , and 20 percent that is exactly this is the example of 50 : 50 copolymer , this is where exactly happens.	10.63799268455321
So , we do not know; from this structure we know whether this r and s but at least we know , if this r then this is will be s or if it s this will be r.	10.159790502496746
But it can be true; this post can be true for the other anionic polymerization as well.	9.06404281377447
That means for the availability of the different amino acid residues in the protein molecules and the number of reactions that are reported for each amino acids you notice that this the kind of sequence.	9.978592561326982
If we consider e = e0 e - kdt you can simply calculate half life as t1 / 2 = 0.69 / kd t1 / 2 is less in the case of adsorption.	9.426689311648781
It was suggested that the enzyme active site and the substrate have a conformation which is analogous to lock and the key.	9.179222697915298
We will learn more about k and a , and we will discuss the solution determination of molecular in solution viscometry or you can now complete that discussion.	10.496466754350267
So , we have already added in this 3d lattice which are we are not showing; those i number of polymer molecules are not shown here to make this picture clear.	9.132086781841723
Zero means the magnitude goes to a very small value.	13.114307584116562
You have 6 moles of kinetic chains so initiator residues will have 6 moles , each kinetic residues have 1 moles and you have chains polymer chains , 4 moles.	10.265893321809772
And being hydrophilic , it measure it makes the polymer surface white hydrophilic and in a hydrophilic surface , the water droplets cannot condense into beads.	10.935369829143132
We will come back in the next lecture with that.	5.80576498456838
We have discussed this that , there are lots of physical properties changes , during the glass transition and melting , some of the them are listed here , specific volume changes , specific heat capacity , refractive index , modulus , heat conductivity.	10.497500170771412
In most cases what happened we add some additives like pigment , stabilizers and then process that polymer mixture , you know polymer with the mixture to turn this polymer into a practical product.	9.658819277113322
So , this is in a actual case if the rate of polymerization depends on the conversation , now obviously this gel effect whether it will exists or if exists at what conversion that will depend upon the viscosity of the medium.	8.298354057357864
You see in both cases the active site on the enzyme molecule play a very key role in the variety of functions or variety of mechanisms that we will discuss today.	9.614129403031958
For understanding or for probably analyzing the experimental data for any given enzyme catalyzed reactions we can simply use michaelis menten hypothesis directly.	12.172379189026223
Immobilization of enzyme will have some additional physico chemical features like diffusion and partitioning.	11.607446377860917
So , you need an initiator , whether the initiator is radical or cation or an anion , it has to initiate the chain.	7.730189856344052
You do not see k d term because k d is for thermal initiation process , is actually e d is 0, sorry , this photo chemical reaction process e d is 0 and the other e p and e t remains same.	9.697665482004837
The other is carrier.	7.854267674263499
So , these are the distance of all the segments , all the elements , numerous numbers.	8.979202112757816
Of course , you have to have add the required pigment for or additives other additives for painting applications or so on , so as i said the size of the particles are much smaller than suspensions polymers , is about 0.05 to 1 micron.	10.489425986031446
So , for molecules which have only sigma orbital , mainly sigma orbital , then homo lumo transition happens between sigma and sigma star , which is of quite high energy and not having very practical interest.	10.140827121533324
And , we will talk about induced decomposition of initiator; or , if i have a propagating radical; now , if give example of benzyl peroxide , it can , the propagating radical can react with initiator molecules and form a another radical.	9.811640716630901
We will come to that quantification level.	6.622209259649096
That means during immobilization procedure what is the loss of enzyme activity because there is no method which can give you hundred percent recovery of the enzyme activity that you have put into the system.	10.479056656297699
Now , what are the monomers it is difficult to polymerize , or cannot be polymerized at all.	7.155248664231077
We the chains can come closer and direct; align themselves in a particular direction which basically induces crystallinity.	10.593073486905801
So , you can imagine a equivalent sphere width which contains a polymer chain and the solvent molecules as impermeable hard sphere , and for that hard sphere we know that einstein s equation of viscosity is given by this expression where eta and eta 0 is the viscosities for the suspension and suspension medium which is basically a polymer solution and the solvating medium or the solvent.	9.253310476826401
So , at the beginning when this initiator is formed , in most cases they said that it immediately start the activation and initiation and then , complete the chain.	9.035118189804049
So , all the composition will be stable , so you will get soluble polymer will get solubilized in the solvent in this range and in this range , exactly like this.	9.528189223874652
So different kinds of operation activity can be seen.	12.561312859078717
Now , the values for tetrafluoroethylene is very high extremely high del h value which is is very difficult to is actually 163, trifluoroethylene is 16.	11.023754115603195
What is the order of specificity , to what extent it would be specific , what are the impurities which can interfere in the specificity they are all related to the results of reaction that is the rate of formation of product.	10.339854492755716
And you also know from our kinetics , we the kinetics.	8.444696361482343
Moves here randomly , random fly , random flight.	14.575019652504112
So , if we consider say n butyl lithium as a initiator and toluene as your medium , nonpolar medium and set minus 78 degree temperature.	8.426564260547332
You can have for example glucose measurement.	10.26545376377869
So , we can write for this ideal solution entropy of mixing is given by this expression and remember this is the same as we have seen from raoult s law which keeps the expression of entropy of mixing for gibbs free energy for the ideal solution.	8.798204911660818
What are x a is , x a could be the initiator molecules , it could be the monomer itself to the solvent molecules , it could be the polymer itself or it could be any external agent.	9.304881774556074
In the case of continuous operation , the information about the deactivation rate constant is also required , kd.	8.490899686413975
If it is lower than the polymer , it will not be serving our purpose and if it is higher , then it will pose a lot of other problems like taking the polymer and processing for the application will be difficult because the main viscosity of this polymer is higher.	10.36445329279646
If you have excess di carboxylic acids , then you will land up in the polymeric or oligomeric chain have in di carboxylic acids.	8.973512328332374
That means you assay it or you determine its capability to carry out a biochemical reaction and represent its concentration in the form of initial reaction rate.	8.496782286523676
Here also you have an interphace which consist of hydrophobic tails.	11.17680376255246
One is based on the protein concentration that means an enzyme sample can be quantified on the basis of a protein sample.	9.422726101091431
Now , it depends it depends upon different polymers , the easiest way to think a molecule , a long molecule as a polymer not a oligomer if you add another unit repeating unit or you take out another unit and by doing this addition of one unit or taking out all unit , if the property of the polymer or the molecule does not change you call it as a polymer , but if change significantly then you still call it as a oligomer and that will depend on the chemical structure of the polymer.	9.858330053346027
Similar exercise we do for the second data point we also develop another expression , another straight line and this gives you let us say for s2 v.	12.726028364719411
So to summarize the competitive inhibition , we must notice that the inhibitor molecule binds to an enzyme molecule at a site either on the same side which is ear marked for substrate molecule or at a site in proximity to it in such a way that it interferes or restricts the binding of the substrate molecule onto the enzyme site and therefore it competes for the binding process on the enzyme molecule.	9.142072211220531
Any analytical device in the form of an electrode , physical device which can be usually calibrated in terms of the concentration of the sample it is much easy to handle.	11.486735350054863
For example in the earlier phases let us say up to 90 % , there is no major gain in using pfr.	10.102865867810966
Another thing which is very well related to this strain mechanism is the mechanism what we understand as transition state stabilization.	11.010477273169403
Now , this because both of these are less than 1, so both of these monomers have a tendency to more tendencies to copolymerize compared to homo polymers.	8.438738162037872
As you know the group contribution methsods are utilized to find out theoretically , the value for several other parameters several other properties of polymer.	10.417160803372163
For any reaction whether it is unimolecular or bimolecular the substrate or the reactant has to undergo a transition state.	8.434874494432579
It will be at the stage of x n above 1.	11.225828778345672
This shift in equilibrium although not directly related in any way must be considered in conjunction with the rate of the reaction.	8.655996370924612
So , in last century polymer is one of the biggest success in terms of new material development and as a results more and more applications are existing or coming up where this polymers are replacing the conventional materials like metals , glass , wood and so on for example , i am wearing a spec.	11.247314737157271
Therefore as long as the concentration of these molecules , phosporylated glucose , is not very high it will always tend to go to the fructose biphosphate route and release the energy.	9.957996996351483
So , with this we have completed our discussion on stereochemistry , polymer stereochemistry and coordination polymerization.	6.17749592135776
We need not limit it to an irreversible behavior and he also mentioned that instead of having an equilibrium behavior here we have a steady state behavior which means the rate of change of x is zero with time.	9.631691450759536
So , if we look at some data; let us consider methyl methacrylate as a this is a normal butyl lithium in toluene at minus 80 degrees 78 degree centigrade.	9.338342099796353
Now most cases , this type of the combination is your transitional metal compounds and alkyl aluminum compounds.	10.72353057430039
So , look at the number again benzene cyclohexane toluene if you increase go toluene to ethyl benzene isopropyl benzene the tendency of transfer reaction goes up.	9.068494355073222
So we come at now , only to radical polymerization.	7.839161438636943
Welcome back to this course in polymer chemistry.	3.424680136908303
We are talking of e.	6.689696642461967
And once the polymer and this pellets are supplied to the equipment manufacturer , they do a processing steps to give you or to give the final shape , design fabrication step or in a finishing shape and you get the final products which gives you the , which goes into the final applications.	10.322340029490954
This is for binodal and then similarly , i get line for the spinodal points which will coincidence or converge in a same temperature , which we call t c , critical temperature and the corresponding composition here is phi 2 c which we discussed in last lecture , here.	9.255739823291101
It varies; that means if you consider along the length of the reactor , kind of a batch reactor with different reaction times but to arrive at the reactor performance what we can do is we can make a material balance across a differential element of the plug flow reactor and if we consider differential element of volume d v you can make your material balance say under same conditions like the feed flow rate as f , the conversion changes from x to x +.	10.164773797531367
There are number of mechanistic hypothesis which have been proved.	9.354271471960669
But the magnitude of apparent km will be slightly different and will be given by v0 = vm . s / km ( 1 + k / h + ) s if you analyze the two apparent km terms , in this case this one and in this case km.	8.443158359125125
So , p d i would be very narrow.	8.41182544221843
Now , there are other detectors which can be used now a days modern gpc equipment used like viscometer which can detect the intrinsic viscosity on line in a real time and light scattering detector which can determine the weight average molecular weight online , which basically gives us the scope to find out this molecular weight distribution in actual sense.	9.842992387853615
Now , with a homopolymer , with all the examples , we talked about polystyrene , poly methyl methaculate , polyvinyl acetenol and all these things , actually you can , the options are very , very few , in true sense you can have only a set a homopolymers , not much.	10.049978405730068
Now , before i move to the , this lecture s topic on temper polymerization , i just want to very briefly touch upon the thermo dynamics of polymerization.	8.241471629596834
This field of application is also more important from the point of view that it has an economical implication particularly because that you have some other alternatives available particularly in the form of chemical transformations with which the enzymatic transformation have to compete and therefore the system has to be optimized up to the complete plant design.	11.099688445871402
E0 is not reduced but the effective total concentration of the enzyme , e 0, which is catalytically functional is reduced and it is only the es component which is catalytically functional.	11.576145925711431
And as i said these are used for the polymers that whose glass transition temperature is way above room temperature , like methylmethacrylate other acrylate esters , vinyl acetate , vinyl chloride , and so on.	8.716730666477895
So , maximum transparence for pmma in real case , we get about 92.8 percents.	11.177754263649351
If i take this as excess , now this will react with this acid functionality as along they are present because they are present in a smaller amount.	9.404285843963361
But more conveniently they can be used in the form of the immobilized enzymes in continuous reactors.	8.792220808779698
The frequency factor a * you can say because a is the reactant , a * exp ( - e * / rt ) which is a very common expression what we all know as arrhenius expression.	9.761296138655986
One international unit of enzyme is the quantity of that enzyme or the concentration of that enzyme which can convert one micro mole of substrate into product in unit time per minute.	10.73203343073514
Now , if you want to convert elution time to elution volume , there should be the pump , which are getting used in the gpc equipment should be pulse free and it should be able to maintain a steady flow typically around 1 ml per minute.	8.93035779915052
So , this is what signifies , so if you want to make a disk and find the , which will be used for an application at higher temperature , you must know the hdt of that particular material.	8.615735403069793
These are the cheep polymers.	7.541731639480945
So typically , if a polymer sample has quite a few fraction of low molecular weights which are below the cutoff of the membrane , then the m n or the number average molecular weight determined by this method typically becomes little lower estimated.	10.842525971373641
So , the amount of energy required to break this bar is called impact strain.	6.928385570649847
These are all calculated data from this expression.	7.0304233872255955
This will gives us the idea about geometric isomerization.	10.291354925452985
In this case , the enzyme has been immobilized on sites which are in very great proximity to the active site and therefore the participation or the involvement of the substrate with the active sites is reduced and that also results in reduced enzyme activity.	9.33552164388529
But there are no other thermodynamic or kinetic interpretations which can be applied to the specificity.	9.148095712988285
In fact , this is true for any chain growth polymerizations , so we can generalize this chain growth polymerization.	8.801555912881083
Anode and cathode only come in picture with either the substrate or the product which is a result of the enzyme reaction like for example here you see the second case which is for l - amino acid oxidase you have a simple glass electrode just like ph electrode.	10.98285488696239
We will discuss that in detail.	6.002437032852482
The term e * can again be separated into both enthalpic and entropic contributions e * =.	10.071093781393305
We are considering a unimolecular reaction.	7.2655916974027805
Now , if we land up at the end of the reactions something higher than 100, then also problem.	7.537124135003911
We are looking for building high molecular weight for all practical purpose.	11.32069196061943
This is huggins constant; this is huggins equations.	10.035041068087638
That means a and b combining to give you an activated complex ab * with an equilibrium constant of keq or you can put it as say k *.	10.003686017015104
If you consider a very hypothetical condition a single pore as a part of the matrix.	6.837952242869661
Obviously , i , the catalyst or the coinitiator also affects the rate of polymerization.	7.787176066960342
Now , in case of step growth polymerization if you stop in between you will see all these small molecules.	6.567517202938786
So , we will be going to get a atactic polymer at higher temperature.	6.908402643989073
Vm / ( 1 + i / ki ) v = km / ( 1 + i / ki ) + s km = km / ( 1 + i / ki ); vm = vm / ( 1 + i / ki ) both the parameters are reduced by a factor of ( 1 + i / ki ) and the double reciprocal plot in the presence of un - competitive inhibitor will be 1 / v = km / vm.1 / s + 1 / vm ( 1 + i / ki ) therefore you will notice that the un - competitive inhibitor does not change the slope.	5.642769250666128
If we consider all the carrier binding methods excluding those which involve covalent linkage , rest of all the bindings , interactions between the carrier and the enzyme are covered under the term called adsorption.	10.092692582018662
Sometime the information required is only to understand the optimum ph value of the reaction.	11.288613998329222
What is the principle of d s c and d t a.	7.465657501207464
Now , we know , for a chain polymerization how you define the molecular rate , if we calculate , these are moles of monomers consumed divided by the moles of polymer chains produced.	10.848009884356388
They lose the asparaginase enzyme , the enzyme which hydrolyses the asparagine in the system.	9.434497065509733
I think you will also recall what we had seen earlier; the diagram in which you have a thin film , a stationary film around the particle.	10.053335899667212
Consider a bimolecular reaction in which a and b participate to from ab * as a transition state.	8.95158469592317
So , he or she may not buy that material so , anti - fogging agents basically , a surface - active agent with migrate to this polymer surface.	9.098125466817962
That means if you recall the log s0.5 what we deduced earlier from our equation was nlogs0.5 = log k if you know the slope and determine the value of n and also determine log s0.5 that means substrate concentration for 50 % of maximum reaction velocity you can get the value of k what is known commonly as hill s constant.	9.13601000580747
That means the average number of radicals in 1 particle is half , because the probability of finding 1 radical and no radical is same , so probability of finding 1 radical is or the average number of radical is half.	8.734548218807646
Rather , if the polymer chain can be initiated , polymer chains can be broken at some , some place and you get a radical or some active center , the polymers will depropagate , unzip to form monomers , so that the free monomer concentration goes up and gives you the equilibrium monomer concentration.	11.018357957931197
This dispersion is then cast on a sheet so that you can get thin film of the enzyme entrapped in the collagen membrane.	10.74067236946542
In all reactions which are redox reactions oxygen electrodes are used and if any other ion selective measurement has to be done then the potentiometric electrometer is used.	10.373713201895807
The inference i want to arrive at is that higher the fractional conversion required for a particular reaction under first order regime , the relative quantity of the enzyme required in the cstr will drastically increase.	9.88650448457435
Almost an analogy with the biotechnology in general even the enzyme technology also has a very multidisciplinary nature.	10.893784182106899
So , basically we had to put twice; average multiplied by twice for this.	6.837555072051219
If it is a solution you have to take out the polymers as a powder form.	8.269622270809203
So , whereas , maleic anhydride does not homopolymerize it can easily copolymerize with butadiene or styrene because their charges are opposite.	9.789779508937851
Now , one thing you must ask wondering that , why should you use a lattice like this.	7.1077652430133
So , in case there is in future , when you take this polymer for other reaction , if there are any impurities unlikely present which might react with this functional group , you might land up in a problem scenario whereas if you have a mono - functional or chain stopper , the insert cap with non - functional group.	9.11923958656405
Then ph; ph here is not only monitoring but more important is the control of ph.	10.29410429329092
That you can , yourself , this is what happened.	11.617261047482222
Such efforts are drawing attention of people so that we can design enzymes reactions to meet the requirements.	10.584237563835853
So , with this , we conclude our module on radical chain polymerization and what we will do , what we will start in the next lecture is ionic polymerization.	6.730694826305886
Malic acid is directly used in most of the beverages as the acidulant and aspartic acid , the bulk use is in synthesis of aspartane but the quantity required is not very large.	10.84298536626696
Depending on the nature of the carrier and nature of the enzyme that we are talking about , the isotherms may vary.	9.03173045203384
Then you can hope that you will be , your p would be close to .	8.80983560640265
So , you can write 1 by x.	6.342451595394887
I think with that we will stop at this point.	5.640929057159037
I would once again point out that we have knowingly ignored heat transfer requirements assuming that for most of the enzyme catalyzed reaction the rate of reaction is very , very small and so heat transfer during the reaction is not a major critical factor.	9.800240947574054
And with that we came to end of the discussion of how to determine polymer molecular weight.	8.58089021065553
Now why you are interested in knowing the syndiotic tacticity of the chain polymers.	11.075513664113497
The only difference will be that we must take in account multiple binding sites in terms of concentration of enzyme.	9.197177671771366
These hydride can get terminated and transferred to the transition metal forming a within end group in the polymer.	9.850264263378541
Psi was if you recollect the this was entropy parameter now to have this term negative , for a positive entropy factor or parameter , t has to higher than the theta temperature to have mixing.	10.640760947455611
So life is very simple.	8.603210837154899
So , along with that 95 of monomer present in the system , we get the other part as a long chain polymer molecules.	8.524916335207191
A similar situation will be in the case of lysine for example when you have more than one basic amino group.	10.509089261555173
Now , to take out that h 2 molecule or any other condensate from the reaction , it has to first come to the surface.	9.012136440692139
Now , for application point of view , immiscible polymer blends is is not useful because then what happen during processing , they delaminate from each other.	8.018182224451442
We can take the polymer which is synthesized and get a quantitative m m r done.	9.543146793288075
Now we just drop the steps and write the final step.	9.127150586429783
You take material balance for one of the reaction species say substrate and make a material balance; simplify it.	11.62687205864919
Now , this expression is in sink with our understanding till now.	5.986163922056871
Now , let us move to the next topic , which is frictional properties of polymer solution , we will basically keep our discussion limited to our dilute solutions , now we talk about frictional properties , first thing comes in our mind is viscosity.	8.836799320080694
Now , viscosity of a dilute polymers you can , you must have experienced viscosity of dilute polymer solution is considerably higher compared to solvent.	9.77486114223221
Other examples of azo compounds are , for example 4 4 dash azo bis cyanovaleric acid.	10.886834322461763
So , for that what we need to do in the experiment , we first need to get the r solvent for a dust free solvent.	8.939489127720549
It has rigid plastics and also it finds several applications and there are lots of applications and in most of the applications are pvc plasticized.	10.234887131382196
And if they are equals both are equals to 1 then obviously r 1 r 2 will be equal to 1 then that will be exactly random copolymers.	8.019616060075327
That means you are binding through ionic interactions and desorbing it under the conditions of desorption and therefore the same thing applies here.	9.3578548298649
We can rearrange this expression and write like this which is just a mathematical rearrangement; you can write this.	8.930861450328688
Thermodynamically we can notice that ultimately we are interested in this.	10.481900506350726
Consider a first order regime where k m is much , much greater than s.	8.791341028125487
Now , what could be reason between the difference in this tendency of the solvent towards different monomers , again as we discussed in the last lecture if this propagating radical is very reactive.	8.902468203382897
The first is effect of ph.	8.954763332314604
Inactivation and in case of even cstr many of the enzymes or the carrier particles that are.	13.807021955210901
First pathway involves two steps this one and this one.	9.43585142043983
There is a cylinder somewhere here , which basically pushes the polymer melt mix polymer melt in the mold and when molding is done , it is cooled and the part is ejected from this material this mold.	10.509154716952391
We are talking about making ester between acid and alcohol.	8.148178974497613
So , obviously if i having a random polymerization where it is only dictated by the feed monomer composition , not by the reactivity of the two monomers , then a fifty - fifty feed composition will produce these three carbonate linkage.	9.30797337750042
That means usually the product stream after the batch processes will be contaminated with an enzyme.	9.253944786742997
Now we can have let us talk about the polymerization of conjugated dienes.	8.415165460419335
We have assumed that the enzyme has a single substrate binding site and on this the substrate molecule binds and e - s complex is formed.	8.996101983246483
Higher the temperature , the k will go up , and your reaction will go to its right hand side.	9.82913612975291
In the last lecture we were discussing about the various ways of classifying polymers and at the end we came at the most important ways to , you know important way to classify polymer is based on its structure and the mechanism by which it is typically polymerized with , on the base of structure we , it was said that you can divide polymerization , polymers in addition and condensation in two ways.	10.135078852569421
Now , in some cases the chain polymerization can gives you a situation like this where the molecular weight increases linearly with the conversion.	9.110235014012135
When substrate concentration becomes very high , the possibility or the statistical feasibility of one carboxylic group from each of the two substrate molecule binding to the same enzyme molecule becomes much higher.	9.649978983197302
So , we can write this two approaches when to rate constant when k r and k m where k r is the rate constant for the syndiotactic addition , r means racemic to consecutive carbon they will have different configuration.	8.090261100534617
Positioning of the functional residues at appropriate positions so that it weakens certain bonds can also be considered covalent catalysis.	12.355738318366125
We are considering that there are no diffusional limitations.	7.619780507166536
Solubility of the polymers with the experimental chemical; obviously , to be resistant , the polymer must be soluble , in the experimental chemical , and that depends on the crystallinity and the morphology.	12.879399941545442
If you replace this one with if you interchange this molecule with this molecule , you are getting the same arrangement.	9.376132506937829
It will be q multiplied by 1 .	9.602875594098549
So , it is always preferred , that you have a polar solvent , it is , this is always preferred.	8.099563690451426
Enzyme loading.	9.956698016111877
Now , if this two cannot defuse fasten off to find each other and react then obviously the termination rate will come down , it will become diffusion control; that means , the intrinsic is very fast.	9.27163082178209
In many practical situations the inhibition patterns are usually complex.	8.671746499060065
So , basically if you put a mixture of different size polymer in this case only two size is shown here; may be big and small molecule.	9.030880476102027
That means the tip should be next to the sensing site of the electrode.	8.164939028093771
If you want to make bottle , plastic bottle for a perfume , or say something else like , alcohol , then obviously , that plastic material has to be resistant to that of alcohol , to be survived for long time.	9.545604559888886
For zero order f0 = l [ k 2e0 / de . ss ] 1 / 2 this will be thiele modulus and so rearrange the expression in the form of f and get the reactor performance or you can also find it out that at what thickness from the center that is at what value of x let us say x is equal to some critical value of l when the substrate concentration approaches to zero.	10.856010902822268
You are not going to be very specific that this is the volume required.	12.014674566564642
A major advantage is in cases where sample contains amino acids that decompose by acid or alkali such as tryptophan and detection of d - amino acids.	9.349647082215713
However if you have same thing you have seen for t g , in case of t g , if you have bulky side group , not a long not long pending grouping from the chains , but if you have a bulky groups , then this contributes or gives steric hindrance in rotation , and which increases stiffness.	12.132312338583557
For the first time he carried out reactions under controlled ph.	8.822189333596583
Dispersion of collagen and enzyme in water is spread over a film , thin film usually.	12.8910669901347
Now , if you do a cationic polymerization , then obviously styrene is much more reactive compared to mma in a cationic polymerization.	7.352296916719166
Now , you can argue me that these are very common common materials and these are no need for main development work for this.	8.985081386415057
And if your , at any point of time if your monomer concentration is equivalent to your equilibrium monomer concentrate , then the reaction will stop , that means , that there will be no appreciable or there is no change in the concentration of the free monomers.	8.525011000113135
If you can think of that the next carbon also have same configuration and if they alternate , then they are called syndiotactic , this is isotactic and if there is no order , then it is called atactic which is basically random distribution.	11.321022573965228
So , you get high polymer , high molecular weight polymer at the beginning and as time goes more and more chains get initiated.	9.480762971294896
We will start from that point that even if you follow the requirement of successful step polymerization , here could be some other reasons , which you need to , you know , be careful , so that you have a successful buildup of high molecular weight in a step polymers polymerization process.	9.98395570461451
Other initiations possible by electron transfer , electron transfer , for example , reaction between sodium and naphthalene.	12.529919436097336
You cannot use halogenated solvents , which were suitable for cationic polymerization because they are fissile reactions with the carbon ions and other polar solvents like alcohols or ketones , esters also cannot be used , as well as , h 2 o cannot be used because the same reason of cationic , because they can very quickly react with the carboionic propagating species and terminate the chain reaction.	10.597724202106075
And this is , this is , this r stand for transfer constant and are given by the rate constant for the transfer and rate constant for the propagation.	8.498437306513528
F . s = f ( s + ds ) + ( - v ) . dv one can simplify it to get f . ds = v . dv here for the fraction of conversion x = s0 - s / s0; ds = - s0dx f . s0.dx = - v . dv you can integrate this and the integrated form will give you the zero to v dv / fs0 which will be equal to zero to x dx / - v or v / fs0 because feed rate is constant , substrate concentration is constant and so the definite integral will come to v / fs0 and that is.	10.57860058869215
Kl can be determined either from experimental data from the lineweaver burk plot or from empirical equation of the jd factor.	10.76556823939328
This is all.	8.342686337020151
Almost all the methods are employed to immobilize the methionine acylase.	10.11877499580566
So , as e x n , which means , that in case of radical polymerization initiated by a photo chemical reaction , again the reaction rate , rate of polymerization increases mildly , in this case with increase in temperature and so does the molecular weight.	8.077053951439764
Now mole fraction represented by x i or i can write capital x i mole fraction is n i by n .	11.085820906754904
We will not discuss this is not a part of this chain copolymerization , where you have make a monomer a , which you polymerized , by living polymerized method , poly a , and then add a second monomer to make poly a and poly b.	9.190677809076327
And then , make a short short which means , you can inject less material , which was supposed to be filling the entire mold.	12.184282276524833
Polymers , they are defined as the polymers which are synthesized by addition reaction.	11.742695565147285
This is something analogous to micelle.	8.361683811494867
Now , in last lecture we had discussed this page , and remember we discussed this that if this active chain end in a propagating chain , polymer chain , if this carbon is radical or it is a anion or cation with a counter ion which is not strongly binded.	10.525118937158904
A small amount of monomer are are will be present or will be solubilized in the surfactant core , because we know that surfactant cores are hydrophobic in nature , which means they can this like core; so they can solubilize any non polar or hydrophobic molecules inside.	10.872086387135882
And for the critical this was the critical point you get , again if you do this you have the expression for delta g m and star for if you do this you will get pie 2 c for the critical.	11.518874491320345
So , it will be contour length; whereas , your r m s end to end distance would be 154 armstrong which is 100 lower than contour length , and that is coming from this n to the power half term.	8.215756951133505
And finally , the melting is comp and melting and mixing is completed here and this this polymer melt is comes out from this dye.	10.034441361508266
R square to the power half.	7.559288700453495
In this case the example i showed you polycarbonate the sodium hydroxide was present to neutralize the hcl byproduct.	9.239359630855269
What is thermodynamic control.	10.805477120541738
It has good strength and dimensional stability.	9.044015318716516
In that case , we have seen that f 1 is mole fraction of the monomers same as the mono fractions in the feed.	8.802404125872412
So , 1.5 nu again you get this same number so fine so you will know how the average degrees of polymerization is related to the kinetic chain.	8.851075071489655
For example , if you dealing with a 100 k polystyrene molecules which typically we deal in lab , then look that p theta does not increases much with scattering angle.	8.559575876668164
Under what conditions the effectiveness factor should be more than one.	13.375072258497502
Now you can have substituted 1, 3 butadiene as well.	7.791059470610311
Very often a dye can be used provided the dye does not interfere in the reaction or it doesn t get adsorbed in the carrier material.	11.1986254955065
Now , in this case the excess rayleigh ratio is angle dependent and it has larger value or the highest value at 0 angle; and as we increase the value of the scattering angle , the value for this excess rayleigh ratio start decreasing.	9.387031384846825
Now , consider another temperature t 1 you get this type of this is another general type curve.	10.265837800400181
I will also cover both the chemical structure as well as physical structure of the polymers and how it relates to the polymer properties.	10.884946792279635
So , k s c is .	6.331355559519053
They must have at least or functionality of two to that means they can be , no , reacted at least from two sides for example , we talked about styrene molecules or ethylene molecules which means they can be extended from two sides.	11.099073227244716
The most simple system probably you are familiar is by ultra violent absorption.	10.249863764208248
So , typically how this , what is the ranking m z is always higher than m w , then m v and m n.	8.510029484784972
So it is not only the effect of product inhibition which is more serious in the case of a cstr compared to pfr but when high fractional conversions are required the product inhibition becomes even more serious.	8.824552077196286
Now , it can do a substitution reaction here , substitution nucleophilic reaction here and form again a methoxy group here.	8.49662455563296
For example , instead of taking butyl lithium , this is taking buthyl lithium , if you take a bulky lithium group like 1, diphenyl hexyl lithium or say , cumyl lithium.	10.318756433247765
If you notice the shift up to what i have already told you see ph effect change.	8.74953655143524
Now , it is n a into p.	8.457563515244074
Obviously , this has lot of disadvantages.	9.905638518937028
But it will not emerge in one go it will come out in small lots.	10.784472730144387
As far as the analysis is concerned all the three can also be analyzed by a double reciprocal plot.	7.761221167687736
In the case of a batch mode the enzyme is going along a product stream and in some cases the discharge of proteins into the product stream may cause purification problems.	9.249001435865614
And polymers produced in this case are in the form of beads droplets , so you can simply at the end of the polymerization you can just separate out the beads by filtering process.	9.966272516652596
Still this is , this zeigler - natta polymerization is not completely understood.	10.538809264598177
So , if a material or plastic which survives longer , in that outdoor condition , it is a weatharable material.	9.874100083786391
So , i can write this is for the mixture s m.	5.624177959900532
So , if you increase the conversation that may be more and more polymer forming less and less monomer present in the medium then means the t g of the polymer present is becoming higher and higher because you are reducing the amount of monomer present in the media.	8.91430740687966
So , now this is independent of which polymer you are using as long as we are using log of eta multiplied by molecular weight that gives the size of the polymer whether it is a different shape polymer or different type polymer.	9.798752879943589
The organization of those chains provides certain natures which are responsible for the catalytic function and these multimeric chains or the multimeric proteins as some of you are familiar have a distinct role in regulatory aspect of the cellular metabolism.	9.794989105265534
And if i want to do it for delta g m star which is for segment and pie 2, we can easily imagine that the slope would be slope at any point of that curve will be mu .	10.197208183088895
Normally what is happening is that this substrate is getting transported from bulk to the surface and at the surface reaction is taking place.	10.447253976185838
The concentration of any specie of a reaction system is homogeneous same at every point in the reactor and that is equal to the concentration at the product stream because it is a perfectly mixed system.	10.864288847118095
And because the diffusion is slower compared to the actual reaction , polymerization reaction this reaction this polymerization reaction are often diffusion controlled.	10.364431548516869
Once the polymer characterize is over , we go to the processing step and finally , make the product , for the processing step we need to know few information about the polymers.	10.847572056499539
It s the number of steps involved in formation of that each having n - 1 step.	11.102626661853787
And , in this case , this is a repeating unit; it is same as a structure unit , structure unit is the residue of the monomer.	7.95017554921184
Now , when process this polymer at high temperature is actually evolved or produced hcl and that is very detrimental for several applications.	9.860298616936124
In case of amorphous polymers , where polymer chains , long polymer chains are placed randomly with no order and in case of crystalline polymers , you have the chains placed in like a crystal.	10.485469657917323
Each segment has z minus two 2, with a neighboring cell other than a polymer.	9.453695372187896
This is surface; this is thin film.	8.019187500450116
One of the empirical methods to determine the kappm apparent was given as kappm = km + k2 e0d / d purely an empirical solution to describe the problem.	9.849063797971484
So , in this case , this is x n , this is your p , this is conversion.	9.315155497689648
Similarly on the external film diffusion also the linear velocity of the immobilized glucoamylase using the 30 % weight by weight 40de corn syrup , the data here are important in the case of starch syrup because starch syrup when we use for hydrolysis we use a very thick syrup.	9.767807926222195
Many aspects of chemistry have to be understood in relation to enzymes or in other words you can add the term biochemistry.	10.553533221990726
So far we have discussed various methods under the category of adsorption including ionic binding and metal salt linkage , cross linking and covalent bond formation.	8.127364072424571
So , you can replace by the mole fraction this number it gives the same number.	8.080635511216135
So , that is the , i guess the interaction energy between a polymer and a solvent and we named as a flory - huggins polymer solvent interaction parameter.	7.633719705211007
While immobilizing the preparation , one can add substrate molecules or other stabilizing agents so that they are retained along with the enzymes and stable preparations can be obtained.	11.288857053620163
The basic motivation or rational for the use of co - factor linked enzymes comes from the function of living cell in which a number of co - factor linked enzymes are operational in various metabolic path ways which are used by cells for carrying out their various catabolic as well as anabolic reactions.	10.46652057978858
So , we can express all the three rate constants , k p , k t and k d in terms of arrhenius equation e to the power minus e p where e p is the activation energy for propagation.	8.478480918841514
I will just do quickly n 1 factorial plus n 2 factorial divided by n 1 factorial and n 2 factorial.	9.127516994187788
So the rate of concentration will be f2.v dc / dt.	9.492517165522163
There are three major constituents in any kinetic analysis.	8.434061060633816
These are three possibilities , this is not happened very practically , but these two are very common in practice.	11.249063456861933
So , if i , this is the region where this is unstable or two phase system , this is a metastable system which is thermodynamically unstable , but metastable and this outside is completely stable.	9.703242576442854
So , the molecular of repeat unit is the average of the structure units minus , the conducted which had gone out , in this case water molecules , because of the condensation reaction.	8.988634504920938
So , and also we define a term f average , which is the average number of functional groups present per molecule , per molecule , which will be given by n i f i total n i , if n i is the , n i is number of molecules having f i functional , fi functional groups.	8.863978847419215
This is what we are talking about the molecular shapes.	8.596820530701807
So , now , this is again , the m dot is the summation of concentration of the , all the propagating radical.	8.559100454134992
It will , it will become like a sheet.	9.603080893849594
Let us think about the thermo dynamics little bit , we know that.	9.230413896930655
So , if i compare different monomers with a particular radical say like styrene in this case or mma in this case , so you will see that these numbers lower in this , which means the order of reactivity of these monomers following this order , which we just showed in the last page for a particular radical.	9.91044282691327
We have talked about shape , it could be random like , worm like looks , like rod like and most cases , we deal with their enough flexible to become closer to a random coil.	9.27663422586851
So , that is backbiting by substitution nucleophilic reaction.	6.481753742635275
There are two things to be looked at.	8.222778280096358
We talked about all the theory and principle behind molecular weights rates and all this.	8.985309196923755
Now , here defining two more term r 1, which is k 1 1 by k 1 2, and r 2 k 2 2 by k 2 1, and if we apply these conditions , steady state condition and use this two expression , then we can write the composition of the two monomers , in the copolymer as this.	8.856124870974439
It could be something else as well , but for time being , i will just give you the most common example.	8.524568065198823
They are mixed type of inhibition patterns and mixed inhibition pattern are attributed to modification in the dissociation constant as they are obtained.	10.089561259525915
So , what is the feed ratio of the different monomers has to be same as in the polymers as a copolymers as well.	8.236124713303584
So , because of cyclization x n comes down.	6.284506953238752
The molecular weight or degrees of polymerization.	9.02713719003347
So , any absence of any transfer reaction , you get the highest molecular weight , which is basically the molecular weight we get in absence of transfer reactions.	10.772469997501549
Here a hydroxyl group containing matrix reacts with a bi - functional reagent.	11.834273412765377
So , if you increase , there will be complications of the , which type of initiation is dominating and so this equation will be combination of photochemical reaction and a.	8.520195666600365
So , this is e f so any point between c and e and f and d now , if at if this has to phase separate to any of the slight changes in to slight changes in the composition.	8.688209855396945
If you have a longer pendent groups , it actually plasticizes the polymer molecules , by increasing the free volume.	8.756070145637787
On the other hand if there is a mixing with some dead zones , some stagnant zones again the mixing pattern might get unchanged.	8.602195639761728
Similarly oxten proposed a limit that minimum there must be three points of interaction.	10.590728454236974
Butyl rubber , which is basically copolymer of isobutylene , the example of which we get many times in this lecture and small quantities of isoprene , this is done at very low temperature , 90 degree centigrade with aluminum chloride catalyst and in chlorinated solvent.	12.32004438333378
So , what are the ways you can do that or what are the ways you can have avoid that and what are the utilities or the problem if a student being.	8.506471788166035
Then , it is a problem , that those might degrade and generate some impurities in the polymer , which can generate color or which can degrade the polymer in later stage and , and it will not give you , not give you the properties , which you are looking for from that polymers.	10.732970317395386
This distribution let us draw it again in next page.	8.824404691620114
Styrene , you get polystyrene.	16.317021907284598
Typical examples are hydrolysis of starch , hydrolysis of penicillin to produce six amino penicillanic acid.	9.926972784900096
Now , let us see how these different types of copolymers would result in a variation in composition.	7.02432539852569
You can write the kappas here and you can have the kappa product.	8.960951582012706
Various approaches can be adopted.	15.573784816056646
One can write the reactor performance equation as - k m ln ( 1 - x ) 1 1 1 e.	7.446878392119514
The second reason is that the enzyme loading per unit volume is much higher in the pfr compared to the cstr.	11.11527729093251
You always have a better reaction on your hand which is having a high equilibrium constant.	8.247353793085523
The performance will be dictated.	11.925136364246901
So , to avoid or to eliminate any intermolecular scattering effect for that we are extrapolating c is equal to 0 and we want also eliminate any intermolecular scattering effect.	7.700457814331674
Then d is inversely proportional to the rate of the diffusion; that is also quite obvious.	11.611001584980022
So , the concentration of the species , which is forming intra - molecular reaction , which is carrying out , which is undergoing intra - molecular reactions to form cyclic also come down.	9.011801054843893
Under those conditions if you take the first expression you will notice that this can also be considered almost like as you mentioned earlier while looking at the validity of michaelis menten kinetics for bi - substrate reactions that if we put one of the substrate concentration in excess the expression can represent the bi - substrate reaction kinetically with respect to other substrate.	10.479696580862727
You can , depending up on the substitution , the rotational , the rotation across the single bond always allowed now , if you have so many bonds in case of , so many single bonds.	9.385570385939934
So , if we assume that the output does not depend on the concentration , not on the polymer molecular weight; this is the detector signal and this is the elution volume v e.	9.32075522605402
But if you consider the summary of the rate equations , i summarized here the random ternary complex formation.	7.579511320695686
Enzymes therefore can be termed as active proteins which have catalytic function in a living cell.	8.431641475212334
So , this expression tells us that v e decreases linearly with the polymer size goes up v will go down.	7.762312659542973
When we immobilize enzymes if we monitor the kinetics parameters km and vm , the simple way to measure the kinetic constants for an immobilized enzyme reaction will be to carry out the reaction in a batch stirred reactor.	9.402395713401688
So , what does it mean.	3.608268498524666
P we are considering as a constant.	12.173304644839638
And there are other possibilities using these where electron transfer reactions , examples given sodium and naphthalene , and as this , as if seen this propagation state , that termination is not present.	10.127122663080037
So , to have the product formation you have to take out the small molecular rate , condense it out of the system.	7.679132376482196
It becomes a very stable system.	11.468031407693296
In most cases you will notice , if you look into literature , that the km value undergo a change.	10.042165967564486
We know the width number of fraction and weight fraction.	8.796836422691033
That means they are dependent on the method of immobilization.	5.987606377876205
Now if you claim that the optically activity is a very short range phenomena and that only depends upon first may be first one or two atoms or groups around this stereo center or asymmetric center.	9.916960080457061
No . energy of activation is not equal to kt.	10.330613588761679
For organic solvents it could be cellulose or gel cellophane; aqueous we can use cellulose acetate , nitrocellulose and if you have a corrosive solution , then we can use glass membranes.	12.494993717684814
So , if i talk about pet bottle when you synthesize pet in the lab and that is not a plastic material or when you take a pet molecule poly terephthalate molecule in the plant and then mix with the stabilizer and other things and form that bottle , that is called plastics.	10.172821481765487
Now , this m dot in in theory or in principle can be found out directly from a sides measurements which get the total initiator concentration specially at that stage , this stage.	9.372758466443049
If we can understand or arrive by some means the distribution of the residence times of the various element of a fluid which is passing through a reactor with respect to time and that distribution can give us an idea about the extent of flow pattern.	10.148164636537011
Unfortunately this analysis will not yield any information about whether it is an ordered or a random ternary complex formation mechanism because in both cases the rate pattern will be identical although the magnitude of the ka , kb and k a might vary but they may have a positive value.	10.203154895704012
Besides that the carrier must also have certain properties like porosity that means large surface area so that heavy enzyme loading can be given to the immobilized preparation and we were talking about methods of immobilization.	9.830578400256604
The most engineering plastics or hypo of polymers , they contain aromatic groups , which intensely absorb uv light around 290 nano meter; and , this is most susceptible light in , this wave length corresponds to 95 kilo calorie per einstein energy; and , that can break most of the chemical bonds.	11.001651912664325
And this is phosgene bisphenola is taken in the aqua sodium hydroxide solution and phosgene is passed through a organic solvent , in this case say methylene chlorideforming bpa pc or bisphenola poly carbonate.	10.176440588623803
For styrene it is 310 degree centigrade , for alpha methane styrene is 61 degree centigrade , for styrene is 220 degree centigrade , what does it mean.	8.993913513106325
Now , what happened if we take out the products is it will be moved towards right hand side.	7.417212908240702
This is equation 1 and this is equation .	12.951393504856076
Now , let us begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization.	4.1012535017642335
Although while they operated , they operated at a single column with the break in between of the operation but today most of the immobilization enzyme columns are operated in a multiple column and staggered start up mode so that the productivity you don t have to make a brake in between and the productivity and conversion can be maintained almost constant within a narrow range over a period of time.	9.873049939653605
Unlike in the case of other methods which are based on tyrosine or tryptophan as residues , the relative concentration of these amino acids in the protein will give you a different reading.	10.709899510178197
So , pdi is 1 plus p.	6.013291522330738
Minimum two of them must be binding sites , out of the three at least two on which the substrate molecule can bind to the active site and put the substrate in a very fixed orientation.	13.046899366013854
Similarly , this temperature you have spinodal points like here and here , this temperature you have here and here similarly , hear you can join them and get a spinodal curve.	8.997982748151847
So , basically that limits our options to choose polymer for the particular applications.	6.800689688911971
E0 is increasing so f is increasing and increasing thiele modulus gives you a lower effectiveness factor which means that the rate of reaction is must faster than the rate of diffusion and that is what the ratio is described by thiele modulus and therefore the effectiveness factor decreases.	10.417682929727649
Insoluble substrates can be used.	10.935499789731868
So , the number of chains undergoing transfer reaction is much more many more so the molecular weight drop significantly , it large decrease in the molecular weight and we call this as telomerization.	9.496050323510364
When you go over to high substrate concentration over the range of substrate , over the range of temperature initially at high temperature range almost a similar activation energy was obtained 5..	11.325335946222795
Now using either this huggins equation or kramer equation , you can plot either the reduced viscosity or the inherent viscosity with the concentration term to get experimentally the intrinsic viscosity.	10.821939224674535
You follow the order like heterocyclic ring chains with hetero atom , carbocyclic ring and chains with only carbon.	10.549104897564266
We must here also probably make a distinction between living and non - viable cells.	8.889090290017032
Am is determined experimentally based on the geometry of the particle and kappf can be determined.	11.550893469670305
S , if this is one , then for theta conditions a value would be 0..	12.31378195414811
If , if you have monomers , which , whose ceiling temperature , like alpha methyl styrene , alpha methyl styrene , which are very few where , whose ceiling temperature is very low , then you cannot just use this as such , then you have to consider the depolymerization reaction as well.	10.013583369937145
So , sometimes by using another polymer mixed with other polymer , the properties is met so , we discuss , let us define few terms related to polymer blends , polymer blends as we know , it is a mixture of at least 2 polymers or copolymers.	11.071246116883378
That means this performance will be inferior than this one if the reactor is not an ideal plug flow.	9.149237859325506
All those cases are clubbed under ping - pong mechanism and in this case of ping - pong mechanism the basic hypothesis is that no ternary complex is formed.	9.207286230435392
The chemical nature of the enzyme provides for a quaternary structure in some cases and the quaternary structure is composed of multiple subunits arranged in a particular fashion so that their interaction brings in the confirmation thereby active sites are created.	10.626794722745462
So what we need in the case of synthetic enzyme is that we must have kind of a large molecule with a cavity so that a substrate of definite size can fit into it and mimic a binding process.	10.257943744324459
To analyze the system we have taken , we consider that there are three dissociation constants involved.	11.335501808632062
If you reduce the particle size the effectiveness factor can approach to unity which means that the whole of the matrix of the immobilized enzyme particle is able to get adequate substrate and carry out the biochemical reaction.	8.641956331916646
So , chances of having more cyclics are more in this interfacial polymerization.	8.280640979931652
So , these are the total number of polymer segments in the solution or in the mixture.	6.377241274593544
We are talking about moles , number of moles of these things.	7.736663758570677
Similarly , you can compare nylon 6 6 265 and nylon 6 10 is 22.	11.076548121546653
So , any point in this diagram will be having single , single phase any point with in these.	9.108772902197371
If you comeback after some time and take the , these are the concentration of the monomer and you see , that the monomer concentration is same as before , which means , that monomer is not , monomer is not participating in further polymerization reaction.	9.926431342912798
Similarly , k d is a p e to power minus e d and k t is a t e to power minus e t; e t is the activation energy for termination reaction.	8.859657377419149
The nature of the copolymer would depend upon the reactivity of the functional groups of the monomers , if there are significant difference in the reactivity of the functional groups among the comonomers.	7.555033012911798
Now , what will do now , we will stop here for this class , and we will in the next lecture , we will continue our discussion from here , and deduce the expression for intrinsic viscosity of flexible polymer chains in a dilute solution.	8.507043694797542
Obviously , for well known reason , so transmission is follows , for everything is same.	8.529072919155563
For example there are two parameters : either you can keep the space time constant and increase the enzyme loading; or keep the enzyme loading constant and the space time can be varied.	10.878902899104524
As a biocatalyst in the living systems two very significant characteristic properties of enzymes are noted that is the catalytic efficiency.	10.041462481072966
So , in general we have n 0 number of cells where n 1 is the number of solvent molecules and each size of the each cell is same as the size of the solvent molecules and x is number of segment of a single polymer chain and size of the segment is same as the size of the cell.	7.481923684644956
One polymer chain has x segments and each segment is in , how many contacts solvent molecules.	11.075669106663359
That means if you are able to overcome external film diffusion the increase in linear velocity means you are reducing the thickness of the boundary film and that s why when we talk of km we are talking only apparent change and not the real change.	9.32652753582024
So , this is the final equation; we called this rgd model in the name of rayleigh , debye and guinier for a poly dispersed polymer coil in dilute solution and this is valid for scattering at low angle.	9.122118157584294
And then we will talk about in little detail about emulsion polymerization , and then we will begin in this lecture or sort of introduce the concept of living radical polymerization in this lecture.	8.451512702799763
We talked about cationic chain polymerization in particular detail where we talked about different types of initiation reactions and then propagation.	9.329159344225758
So , the kinetic chains have mobility.	7.7184688988904675
We can just simply say that polymer , this polymer has , this polymer sample has this m n.	9.319384328108942
Now let us take out a basic mode by which this monomer can polymerize.	9.336093398915514
The second thing we have to know is the stability of that enzyme so that the reactions that we are using must also not be carried under conditions under which the enzyme catalytic function is poor.	11.298370561977624
Obviously , it also depends on how fast you are heating.	8.981198557097892
And this kinetics of suspension polymerization is same as the bulk polymerization , the advantage is because you have this aqueous medium present as diluents , so it is the heat dissipation which that heat which formed due to the polymerization reaction.	10.456364443257666
Now , these are high molecular weight polymers these are high molecular weight polymers which you isolate after the reactions.	7.773912700171613
Another point which i like to highlight here before i proceed further is about the si.	11.353817758608923
Not all the polymer chains are of same size or same molecular weight.	6.667603998648956
Considering these parameters one can design the immobilization enzyme preparation also in such a way that diffusion limitations are not there.	9.660538642553787
He got high molecular weight polypropylene , definitely.	13.805881772316535
The enzyme at this stage is counter charged at a particular condition.	10.26173237762834
If in this case , a is the functional group present in a smaller quantity , the fraction of a group which has reacted is defined as the conversion.	8.340694796307377
So , the first segment of this polymers; let me write this.	6.799844392545431
And before i start discussion on polymer properties , i want to very briefly talk about polymer processing.	9.987448893020638
And have if you increase the temperature.	6.968512576686502
All variety of those functions at a molecular level has become an added dimension which has been at the center of the bio technology in general.	10.367890072250333
Now , often if you use polar solvent , for example if you use hydroxylated solvents , hydroxylated solvents like say , h 2 o or alcohol , what happens.	9.026447469965458
On the other hand for the first order reactions the thiele modulus is independent of substrate concentration because 1 - 1 is zero and so it becomes independent of substrate concentration.	7.876723409020575
Concentration of i r is the concentration of r br.	14.588209327131516
We just gave an example with the monomer and what we will do in the next lecture , we will talk about the other termination possibilities and will discuss the kinetics and the energetics of the cationic polymerization , cationic chain polymerization and then also discuss the characteristics and other features of anionic chain polymerization.	7.186356963199578
With this we will stop.	12.287214915544718
We , we have seen , that in the most cases , this poly are step polymers , are equilibrium reaction.	10.43486790156418
You have taken monomers in a ratio very close to r is equal to 1 and you have done the reaction at high temperature for longer time , try to take out the condensate for you know as much as possible.	9.402192085162103
Obviously if you look at this number 19.5 and to 20 this number 19.5 to 20, obviously look at this , this solvents.	10.23723612299121
Whereas this actually undergo ring opening polymerization.	7.652345921710724
Now the bond energy should be such that , the bond should not leave at low temperature at room temperature , or it should not be very high.	8.081195818577202
There is a special case , which where both r 1 r 2 are .	9.381401071162532
The third assumption is it talks of initial reaction rate and when i say initial reaction rate the emphasis is that the product concentration is almost zero.	10.751312680032783
That means the contents , carbohydrates , lipids and proteins or some other biomolecules which are often attackable by the enzyme molecules.	8.594167767737936
You recall that in the case of allosteric enzymes also the relative concentration can be arrived from a similar analysis to have the concentration of each of the enzyme species.	9.356452353129374
Now polymers are somewhere in between , they have depending upon the temperature , and time of straining it.	11.667377842043644
Now , we will do this and go little faster because this is just information , nothing more to understand.	9.80359040109875
Now , if you start see , if you start from here , a point from here , a composition from here corresponding to this corresponding here.	8.600500324866827
And in case following all the normal process normal directions , if you do not build high molecule weight what are the first things to look for , what are the common trouble shooting.	11.186780821121907
This is minus 100, minus 104, 12.	12.673602644580907
And then we will look in to it that how the molecular weight or the size of the polymer determine the solubility of polymer , and which can utilize to fraction fractionate the polymer of different molecular weight.	8.086190302096227
In many cases there has been report in the change in the optimum temperature also.	8.146863163890854
And a minus , the counter ion , should not be heavy , strong nucleophile because if it is a very strong nucleophile , then it can react with the cationic group and make a covalent bond and stop the reaction there itself.	9.850120121593394
In that case also , you can use the same expression.	6.145658460295233
Then as a result of different types of copolymerization , what are the different types of copolymer micro structure possible.	10.188892689046472
So , as a result the t g drops.	7.394199051270221
So , that is why this radical is very stable and that can be stored for days in a container which can be used later on.	7.7596972591239135
I integrate from , at t is equal to 0, m is m 0, and at t is t , m is m , which leads you , minus , this minus here; minus of minus half 1 by m square , minus 1 by m 0 square is k t; or , 1 by m square , 1 by m 0 square is twice k t.	8.945283433899261
Now , what will do with in this lecture , we briefly talk about the interaction of the electromagnetic radiation , the basis of spectroscopy , interaction of electromagnetic radiation with maters in this case polymers.	9.60807819801422
The more is the polarity of these bonds , the more is the inter molecular forces between the polymer chains , which causes in effect more stiffness in the chains which makes the t g , which decreases the polymer mobility and which makes the t g higher.	10.201604187850473
So , if we consider the example , we given earlier.	6.752811543167875
Now , we have to compare , if you compare a polymer chain , how did we derive this gaussian chain structure , the expression for the gaussian chain remember , we used one of the chain end in the coordinate , x , y , z coordinate.	10.860782609874267
So , it would be given by k ln n 1 n 1 plus x n .	6.482609481460961
This binding process brings in the specificity and the nature of the binding site or the active site on the enzyme molecule is slightly complementary or of the similar type but not exactly complementary and the complementarity comes only after binding has taken place which results in the distortion of the reacting group and then the complementary comes in.	10.129913258633774
So , what the model do , you put make a three dimensional coordinate , where the one end is placed as the origin of this coordinate and this is r from the what is found is what is the probability of the other end , be at distance of r from the origin.	9.890948872059612
So , if we look at these optical properties of a plastic material , you can list a number of terms , transmission , refraction , reflection , scattering , absorption , clarity , haze , gloss , yellowness , index by premium color and so on.	8.874131520100127
So , this because the polymer change is always changing with confirmation , you cannot write a fixed r , you have to write statistical parameter which is given by a root mean square end to end distance.	8.238772453301078
Now , if you talk about this monomer.	4.956201638145609
So , it is always preferred , that reaction if possible , should be done in an inert atmosphere , like nitrogen atmosphere , argon atmosphere , so that you are taking away the possibility or minimize , or minimizing the possibility of oxidative , thermo - oxidative degradation of the monomer or the resulting oligomer or polymer molecules.	8.516065188315075
In the middle case from the enzyme and transition state ab you can also form the eab activated complex.	10.854451339376697
What we will do in this lecture , we will cover , basically complete our discussion , which we are having on chemistry on polymer additives and we will talk about fire retardants , surface - active additives and reinforcing fillers today.	8.99490512316746
If you have a lactone give you poly ester if you have a lactum , it will cyclo lactum it will give you a linear poly amide molecules.	9.907118904857196
It has different zones having different temperature within increasingly , if you go from left hand side to a right hand side , the temperature generally increases and becomes steady somewhere in this region.	11.173087901583058
Number three , if we are using more than one detector , we have to do normalization of the detectors; we got the detectors may be of different sensitivity; we define sensitivity and they are having different scattering; if they are placed at different angle then their scattering volume may be different and the scattered light may also refract.	12.303997984222123
All this point we just talked about in a normal radical reaction.	9.202334260527712
And of course , n plus r would be equals to .	6.891015109464194
Now , if we take say an ideal copolymerization where r 1 r 2 is 1 if r 1 is higher than 1 and r 2 is less than 1, then 2 monomers will get into the chain in random fashion , but monomer m 1 will be entering in the chain at the faster rate as compared to m .	8.299080913155807
This is one way to account for the non - ideal flow.	7.309941450826745
What are the sources of this raw materials monomers , mainly they are from petroleum sources so , current end one of the important trend or requirement for polymer chemist at present is to find out natural sources.	10.456392151842817
But they may be a result of a very complex system which cannot be defined very accurately but ionic binding can be defined very accurately.	11.451262408592592
To understand the behavior and to derive certain meaningful conclusions one may create or design experiments in which only one of the ph effect is considered prominent and in fact the ph effect studies have contributed a lot to understand the identification of the amino acid residues in the active site in conjunction with the chemical modification studies.	10.271467963729483
Remember whatever we are doing in this determination there are few precautions you have to take; you have to make the solution to determine the intrinsic viscosity such that the concentrations of the solutions is very low.	11.33657765111313
Usually the solubility can be influenced by salt concentration that means ionic strength , the ph , the organic content in the solvent that means addition of a polymer , an organic polymer can affect the solubility and temperature is a universal parameter which influences solubility.	10.908080174704537
We will be using this stress and strain very very frequently in coming coming discussion.	9.644363331951514
If the enzyme is bound to two substrate molecule a dead end complex is formed.	7.530107096466098
In the numerator you have k2 and es.	8.694529936888308
And we from this expression we know that every temperature; typically what we do in a in lab you actually start a reaction say in a beaker or in a round bottom flask and keep in a oil bath maintained or in some other maintained in a constant temperature.	10.68544873863635
And , debye and guinier actually established a relationship or deduced a relationship for equation for p theta for a mono dispersed gaussian coil which is the case for a polymer coil; p theta can be written like this where again the terms are self - explanatory; s square is the radius of gyration; this z is not there , maybe we can remove this z for time being.	9.739337401840121
We put another dialysis membrane over this teflon membrane and this separates the enzyme which is immobilized in the form of a thin film and particularly in this case study which i was referring to , the immobilized enzyme is cellulose acetate membrane.	10.459024863193022
The cationic , in case of cationic polymerization , the ions are not as tight as in case of anionic polymerization because the size of the counter ions , like lithium , butyl lithium case or some , they are small , so the anions and the canions , cation in case of anionic polymerization are much more tight.	10.458413520489618
For example , that limited oxygen index , we talked about one of the ways to measure the fire retardants properties.	9.815378263304666
You will notice that while looking at the generalized expression of the bi - substrate reaction rate expression we have not really bothered about the dynamics of enzyme substrate interaction.	8.67086291344787
Now , experimentally , or; this is the unknown quantity.	11.817521577517798
Now this was for self catalyst , and this expression for external catalyst.	10.232484486806067
For example this is a functional group and this let us say is substrate.	11.293884453056554
These this points where this two phase actually gets generates or the polymer become insoluble , they are called cloud points; whereas for these composition , at critical temperature it will start forming two phase or polymer become insoluble , above this temperature , you can , you have any composition , they are insoluble.	11.87734086568427
And that is nullified in a pure , so basically in a pure amorphous polymer this gets nullified , and your dimension becomes same as , the actual dimensions becomes same as the unperturbed dimensions.	10.616654634558438
This will lead to m 2 dot.	9.210441629000014
Similarly in research also a student might be analyzing the similar sample hundreds of them over a day and just to get his results.	10.037209532617592
If you write for a first order kinetics sel will be equal to sel = s0e - kt you can assume this k is v m / k m , a first order rate constant for the enzyme reaction and you can also write therefore here s bar from the rtd data will be equal to s.	9.357942334194401
So , it is very difficult to accurately in the d n by d c value.	5.440619425568784
Thirdly we came to inhibition patterns with respect to the single substrate reactions and the effect on the inhibitor concentration on the reaction rate and also the effect of activators on the reaction rate.	9.56013207792231
How do you get.	6.336263023123
An exponential output of the tracer from the reactor.	9.395488908695732
In case , polyethylene teritarate , this is the repeat unit.	8.426317394299055
That will dictate if you want to consider diffusional limitations also as a part of our analysis.	9.480972617238148
Only the p is high; if it is p is 0.98, may be 90 percent of the function groups has reacted , you get 50; x n is 5.	13.194253978741207
So , the value of expansion factor becomes more than one.	7.005321810657721
That means it has lost its permeability barriers for substrate and product exchange.	9.223066388030698
It is also depend upon acid rain , other polythene.	10.46011922128271
So on.	6.433235531616501
While the reaction takes place as a coupled reaction of the two systems , the net reaction is a coupled reaction where the acetyl coenzyme carboxylation is coupled to hydrolysis of atp.	10.88049571128274
So , from the slope we can a 2 as we can see from this expression and if we measure or if we determine a 2 at different temperature and then plot a 2 versus t and then the temperature for which a 2 is 0; the temperature for which a 2 is 0 that would be the theta temperature.	8.387470295651157
Now , that is very difficult to you know get the end - to - end distance , due to that rotational restrictions , short range rotational restriction , it is difficult to get theoretically , it is possible for simplest molecule which is like a polyethylene , which keeps this term.	8.55287430152538
They are known in the trade name of ultem , there amorphous t g is as high as 215 degree centigrade and there are constant use temperature is between 18 170 to 18.	11.217796415477853
They are mentioned even for cylindrical pallets , discs.	10.384324473811702
So , vinyl acetate will have the highest reactivity compared to the other polymer radicals for particular monomers.	9.271661474495312
It is not bi - substrate but a single substrate.	9.480546931099338
Then a very important aspect is bulk environment design.	10.984639793612573
In this case you will notice that at low substrate concentration , when substrate concentration is much , much smaller compared to km you can keep km as the sort of a . . . if it is very , very small compare to km , you can arrive at v0 = k2 [ e0 ] [ s ] a simple first order kinetics and because k2 [ e0 ] is a constant at a given enzyme concentration and substrate concentration is a variable , it becomes a first order kinetics and the portion represented by this area is first order kinetics.	8.510238358098839
Now , let us just complete the discussion , we are having in the last lecture , you know , from flory huggins equation , we have seen this is a , this is the flory huggins expression and then we converted to gibbs free energy of mixing per segment in the last lecture , and which was turned out to be this.	9.095102217844799
They can bind reversibly , randomly and independently; there is no interaction within them.	10.182710218687179
With this let us move on the next technique of determining the number average molecular weight , vapor pressure osmometry.	8.750238086261632
One can also see that the modified km value is km = km { 1 + ka / a } that is when a becomes very , very large the activator concentration present in the reaction is much larger in comparison to ka.	10.056606678919234
Based on these three parameters particularly as i mentioned earlier the conformational changes , mass transfer effects and the partitioning effects , the kinetic parameters for immobilized enzyme are classified into three major classes.	9.798513830324607
Mao does actually two things.	12.951078786701027
Instead of amino group of enzyme molecule you react this material with hexamethylene diamine or any compound which has amino group as the functional group and a chain of methylene groups.	10.4126810793266
So , one thing can be possible; if you want to use or stop these auto oxidation , you might reduce the concentration of the i radical or the r dot; you can reduce the concentration of i dot or r r radical; now , that is basically out of our hand , because the processing and the other external conditions we cannot control.	10.745249791353746
The enzyme thermisters are based on the measurement of temperature difference of the reaction liquid in an exothermic biochemical reaction.	10.056962565896493
Because , this is highly reactive , it will react both m and this , if it is less reactive , then the more reactive between this two will react with this.	10.61484251655907
Now , we can simply write r 1, and r 2 is 1, and used as in this expression , this expression , and we can right f 1 r 1 f 1 and r 1 f 1 plus f .	9.087713487520952
Then it is almost like a packed bed reactor in which the tube side is used as the matrix and it is almost like a packed bed reactor.	8.771764260001438
Normally we will get such a behavior where slope will be km / vm or k2e.	12.93759384169675
So , that is the reason this is this transfer constant as much higher value compared to styrene.	6.261662166405512
That means if you can reduce the particle let us say if this particle was only of this much size and this is the center , then it could happen that the enzyme might reach up to the center of the particle.	9.11722283934573
As you will notice , as we go further , that the enzymes provide a much more efficient catalytic system than their chemical counter part.	10.689794374853559
We will discuss that and on the other hand the second method is microencapsulation where you tend to form a kind of a artificial cell with its boundary of a semi permeable membrane and the enzyme molecules are entrapped within this membrane and these micro capsules can be used as the immobilized enzyme preparations.	8.362023260343
Then , invariably we will talk about application of the copolymers , we are talking about.	7.768334433877343
Now what is del h m for the ideal solution is zero.	8.41583451052486
If it reacts with this , if it reacts with this , then you get bb aa and bb , ok.	7.386051337916408
So , this should be lower than .	7.937640790672924
So , that is why iupac nomenclatures are not very you know used very regularly unless you are making a completed new monomer , new polymer from a new monomer or the the name of the polymers is not conventionally available like polystyrene , if i write tell polystyrene as poly 1 phenyl ethylene you know first time somebody hears the person will not be able to correlate what is , what he is talking about , what i am talking about , but if i say polystyrene it is very easy for the person who is listening , it is easy to comprehend the structure.	10.284122544685292
So , again the assumption is that the electrostatic charge on the polymer radical and the monomer are same , if the monomer residual end of the polymer radical is same as the monomer we are talking about.	8.884984080908964
The enzyme active sites determines the catalytic properties and specificity of the enzyme and these properties are determined by the chemical groups attributed by the amino acids present on the particular small region what we understand as active site.	9.100944335287231
But the importance of the protein concentration lies in the fact that it gives you an idea about the purity of the sample.	9.065437544254193
If a double reciprocal plot is plotted between 1 / s and 1 / v as a function of inhibitor concentration how does this represent.	9.101127945859638
Now , let us take a , as situation where we have saved aaaa b type molecules lose some excess b or a aa type bb type plus some excess b.	8.309409254848065
Now in this , what is reflective means , it relates to the polarisability of the molecules present , polarisability of the molecules present , and that the order of polarisability depends upon , normally size of the group present , so polarisability of different groups will be of like this.	10.02086403388561
Then when you put in the woolen glove it exactly fits into hand depending upon the conformation of your fingers.	11.544247025811632
And to maintain the same temperature the heat or energy is supplied to the sample.	8.797528896712308
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and this eighteenth lecture , we will continue our discussion on ionic chain polymerization.	3.672823735700964
For example , here you can use aromatic tetons.	9.599185527127608
Now , if that has to spontaneously phase separate in to in to two other composition obviously one has to be polymer rich and this one and other has to be solvent rich left hand side.	9.918065191061928
So , as an agent , a radical generates its undergo propagation reaction and at the end by molecular termination reaction have , and the polymers become dead with time you generate different molecular weight polymers and of course , these polymers are not live or dead.	9.750119017300252
Second is your inelastic deformation where , basically inelastic behavior what happened , if you give the stress , give the force , the energy stored in the material.	10.779302694905903
Now , it just react with m n dot and undergo a transfer reaction obviously , this is a hydrogen , which will abstract , slide this is the hydrogen it will abstract from here.	11.259629017230264
So , typically we run ir spectra from say 4000 centimeter inverse to 400 centimeter inverse , and for a non - linear molecules there are n atomic , if the molecule have n atom , the numbers vibrations is 3 n minus 6, so you can imagine for a polymer molecules which have large number of atoms.	10.742412868169417
You can rearrange this general expression by taking certain factors and divide both and you can end up at the constant concentration of b.	9.8342814767526
When you making chain polymers , what you doing.	11.78341826000097
How do you name this then ester form from terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.	8.424936312984608
The error involved will increase if you increase the ratio of km to s0 and you assume a first order because then both will go towards the zero order kinetics.	9.839491068802385
See , in this case , we are not mentioning solvent time now.	7.510299554236582
That means you can consider that kb is the michaelis menten constant with respect to b at saturating concentration of a.	7.615621300118767
But we might assume that the active site is almost complementary to the substrate molecule but is not exactly complementary , a situation which is slightly closer to lock and key mechanism not in absolute terms that they are complementary but they are not exactly complementary.	10.265516327257227
By knowing the two slopes one can calculate klam.	11.863989230701296
This is something like an extension to that and which means that when the substrate molecule binds on one of the binding sites of the enzyme it immediately triggers off a conformational change whereby the affinity for the next binding site becomes much higher and they expressed it with an interaction factor.	10.669926460274826
The name suggests that it take advantageous advantage of reversible transfer reaction.	9.285827112447786
See , if i have a polymer melt i have a polymer melt polymer melt , obviously there are many changes.	8.820071165259497
He also followed initial reaction rate concept as v0 = k2 [ e0 ] [ s ] / ( k - 1 + k2 / k1 ) + [ s ] if you take a general reversible equation and put p equal to zero because at p equal to zero you are considering the forward reaction only where you start with the substrate.	7.7168412863122615
The second is the use of enzyme in two phase systems; an organic and water two phase systems where the enzyme is present in the aqueous phase , the substrate is present in the non - aqueous phase; make an emulsion by agitation or use of surfactant , bring the enzyme and the substrate in close proximity and then carry out the reaction.	8.640506812075683
In the second and more complex case when we talk of co - operative binding if you consider two binding sites on enzyme molecule they may be identical.	9.692040143257708
So , if you compare the earlier equation and the osmotic pressure the derivation we did for osmotic pressure , we can simply write this part as minus v 1, see v 1 is the molar volume of the solvent , 1 by m n minus del h vaporization delta t e; so delta t e by c k e 1 by m n.	7.877020308044799
We will stop at this point.	3.7475559917302608
In fact this job was done way back in early seventies by international union of pure and applied chemistry , what you know as iupac.	10.683407699935646
And , if they stay longer , then the probability of collision between the functional groups which are present at the end also increases.	9.291500183561002
So , basically higher the crystality , higher is the barrier property for that polymer.	7.864550149285892
Now , if i consider this value as two , let us consider this value , which means that m 2 star will react twice as faster with m 2, compare to m 1, so does m 1 star , m 1 star also will react with m 2, twice as fast at it reacts with m .	9.482397866100072
If you want to crystallize polymer , then you have to align them next to each other parallely.	8.837992500556151
Use the two products y or x separately as inhibitors in the reaction and notice the effect of y and x as the nature of inhibition.	12.707844610654702
And if you do not know this k or a the k h or k k , then the process is to determine some or few or very narrowly dispersed same polymer and get the absolute molecular weight from any other techniques , and because it is suppose has to be very narrow dispersed polymer , you can take any of the m n or m w as equals to m v.	9.595260033123289
And from the these values of q and e we now can predict whether two monomers can will copolymerize or not and they are for their ranking in their activities also.	10.140035144723448
For example , thus , lets , this e p values is around no e p around , comes around , say 2.	10.468602438646428
In a simplistic mechanism we notice that we have a dissociation constant km for the enzyme substrate binding and dissociation constant ki for the inhibitor binding.	9.830691133972394
Now , let us compare the values between few monomers and see whether how the monomer structure contribute to the values of , now the simplest monomer is ethylene and in case of ethylene this is from a pure gas to a polymer solid polymer.	9.77604539327615
You can apply this stress or or so that , there is this deformation happen oscillatory , that stress can be applied or the deformation can happen in a tensile way or a shear shear manner.	10.029123187925777
Now this can and this will take part in resonance and it can form.	9.747374355280897
Now , kinetic chain length in this case is same as degrees of polymerization , we talked about this before that , if you have two kinetic chain , and if they are if they are terminating by a combination reaction , then the molecular weights double.	12.906755577250317
There are some other things might results , in change in this nature of the , this line , at very high conversion , which will come back in the proper time.	10.087851788881666
Octanol is considered to be the extreme non - polar medium and the partitioning coefficient of that solvent between water and octenol is the p value and higher the log p value means it is more non - polar and higher the log p value the better it is a suited solvent for enzyme catalyst.	10.550323365959208
So , we must be very careful that the samples which we are determining the m n must be the weight of very small molecular weights.	8.577952949423118
Our interest will always be to have a high fractional conversion.	9.294813790478397
Various other mechanism of and all that will also a play a role in the regulation of the enzyme synthesis.	11.24981051737995
So most of the membranes provide a good adsorption surface and the enzymes get adsorbed on to that and the reactor performance is.	10.372375719485252
In such a case es going to e plus p.	5.853041908149211
Is it clear.	14.540073960773794
Now , as we know that in gel permeation chromatography there is no interaction between the polymer molecules and the pores or the column there is no interaction between them.	8.518282022577967
We will talk about light stabilizer , and then flame retardants.	10.098137587520768
So , at any point of time there are two possibilities , either you can have 1 polymerization is progressing with 1 propagating radical , or it have a 0 polymer radical polymer , 0 radicals in this.	8.46854114292715
We talk about oligomers.	9.650630289761208
We are not doing any manipulation with the transducer; we use the commercially available transducers.	10.067874614690497
None of them is able to provide a suitable explanation for the catalytic function.	10.49934235550771
And in this project we will discuss the leftover discussion on the termination reaction in cationic chain polymerization.	7.549944807143035
So , if t goes up , r p goes up and every decade , every 10 degree centigrade it will be around 2 to 3 times from the original value.	8.509232485074609
In general we call it a biosensor , an analytical device.	9.421894413539388
You can actually name a lot of homopolymers , but they are , they are , that all the homopolymers , so your options are limited with homopolymers.	10.1981032065329
So , basically these are the examples of constitutional or structural isomers as we know from our knowledge basic organic chemistry knowledge.	7.915119204839689
In case of an ionic , you get the other way round because in case of an ionic , the reactivity of methyl methaacrylate is much faster compared to styrene.	9.309471946556732
Assumption is that the electrostatic charge on the polymer radical , which has at the end in monomer 1 structure and the electrostatic charge on monomer is same.	10.425249972083662
Therefore it often gives problem in determining the various reaction parameters particularly the vm and the km values.	9.752044334253588
Now , if you consider this chain transfer reaction or chain transfer constant , c is , say for chain transfer to the monomer is given by k tr is this d ln c by dt is given by e tr minus e p is divided by r t square.	10.013882565835088
So , in case of polyethylene , if you want to write polyethylene you know this is repeated and once you identify the constitutional repeat unit then you have to place this different parts of this repeat unit according to the seniority from left.	9.128602721154799
In spite of doing that you found that at the end of the reaction your desired polymer has not formed.	8.862100293349755
Now , in that case what might had happened , that there could be possibility of simultaneously present of two different types of this ionic associated counterions.	9.610334757776682
You must identify the rate limiting step and put the rate constant k2 that appears in michaelis menten kinetics as one which is the rate limiting step and then michaelis menten kinetics will apply to it.	9.364960543450618
The rate may not come to zero.	7.919217355798686
It doesn t mean that on the surface there are no hydro phobic patches.	11.179015637753983
And , another set of example is the polyester.	9.085605812521122
So , this structure , the functionality in the backbone , they are much more similar with your condensation polymers rather than the addition polymers.	8.956798427996079
That means under certain conditions while you can adsorb the enzyme on to a carrier you can also create condition by which you can desorb the enzyme.	8.341012464011289
And , cost , though the amount of additives are added in small quantity , but typically they are much costlier than the base resin.	10.750763021337603
And , we also showed the values of k d and we found that , no , we seen that k d is much higher for this redox reactions; which means , redox reaction can be conducted redox; they have radical polymerization where radical is generated by a redox reaction can be done at lower temperature including temperature compared to the thermal initiator.	10.30447565284353
The stereo specificity was not very high.	8.335678707732312
The effects due to diffusional limitations on km have been clearly demonstrated by experimental data because if you just use an immobilized enzyme preparation in a reactor and measure km by reducing the particle size you are able to come to a km value which is of the native enzyme which only implies that the diffusional limitations are playing a role.	10.122017376162418
So that is what we do and one can write rate expression for a complex reaction mechanism.	9.136699766230404
The covalent linkage is accomplished through functional groups that are not involved in the catalytic functions , a very standard prerequisite for any immobilization method.	10.095583012123718
So , which means that the molecular distribution if you consider the entire reaction is very complicated because at any instantaneous time the the molecular weight is different.	8.755867588861552
But there will be some effect on the ph stability because the ph what you are offering to the enzyme particle in the bulk is not the same at the enzyme active site.	10.164551705977239
If you take or increase the polarity of the medium , if you compare these two the temperature is almost closed.	8.336327712251652
We assume in a very simplistic way that the enzyme is taking place in a cylindrical pore.	10.325097932478984
So , this is some cases where this is one of the example of where you name the polymer from a hypothetical monomer.	8.63333611832239
And we talk to define initiations possibilities of this anionic polymerization and most important of this is using alkyl lithium.	9.260827432592633
Now , what we will do in the next lecture.	3.527545813950908
And as we know , that the reactivities of the free counterions or the solvent separated counterions are much different than tight iron - pairs.	9.071903727592083
Take the simplest example of glucose - 1 - phosphate.	9.438600617382415
E0.a . b k2k4 a + k4 ( k - 1 + k2 ) b + a . b k3 ( k2 + k4 ) k1 ( k2 + k4 ) you notice a significant difference from the generalized rate expression.	8.26957800369338
You can take help of couplic reaction and you can make four arm in case , say , four arm star polymer.	10.261644760570611
We discussed for examples , for example like for methacrylates.	12.058585697653497
To overcome this disadvantage we usually neutralize some of the negatively charged species by addition of diamines.	12.533804228647448
It must form uniform solutions with the polymers and the added salt; it must strongly absorb the laser wavelength.	10.868991184561715
That is not possible.	8.741395711736658
So , you will get that same property , but in the first case , if you stop the reaction in between at some conversional level , then what happened in after step you go through the compounding and processing step.	8.641633282798512
However while collisions among the molecules might lead to product formation as per this chemical reaction rate theory , it is also understood by virtue of some of the studies on the distribution of molecules which undergo reaction that not all the molecules that collide will result into the product.	9.967861044541973
The degree of retention will vary from enzyme to enzyme; also the more unstable the enzyme the poor will be retention or method of immobilization; more harsher the method that means if the enzyme is subjected to more harsh treatment in terms of ph , chemicals or temperature the inactivation may be more.	10.564207240892893
So , this calibration can be obtained used to get a true molecular for weight of polymer.	8.015690228136611
This one gram theoretically if it is an ideal plug flow , it should come out in a short period of time in as much time as it has been fed in.	9.611638643710867
How many protons are there , and from that how many tertiary , butylacrolate groups , and from that you can get the molecular weight of the first block simple.	8.388228034107485
One of the major advantages of this method is that while in the case of previous methods you get the block of the gel and the gel block has to be mechanically dispersed into a particular shape for use in a reactor , here you can prepare the beads , the immobilized enzyme preparation , almost in the bead form so that that can be directly used.	9.513693745367858
So , in this case , if i take acrylonitrile , vinyl acetate has much higher reactivity compared to acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate and styrene.	7.525458882476677
Many of the therapeutic enzymes particularly the recombinant proteins that are available from the enzymes like streptokinase and urokinase are blood clot dissolving enzymes.	9.752505514517035
In this case as we discussed earlier that , tendency to homo propagate , and tendency to cross propagate is same , so what happen.	8.420166186456788
So , in that case , in that composition radical is a , radical chain polymerization is much least sensitive compared to the ionic polymerization.	8.518003218220775
Now , chi which is polymer solvent interaction parameter also temperature dependent.	8.570320292882508
We in summary we knew that the initiation process is more slower and had the highest activation energy for thermal process.	10.498246380029634
So , current focus in polymer research is to make monomer and subsequent polymers from a natural sources , which could be a bio source or a source which can be renewed or the source by by renewal resources.	10.034775291633295
Now , it can be applied not only for radical polymerization these experiments can be done for step polymerization as well.	8.27565846648539
So , that is one of the strategies of making or controlling the polymer.	5.973058950105891
Let us continue our discussion on step growth polymerization.	6.674480110772141
Similarly the ks is the michaelis menton constant corresponding to substrate s and p corresponds to the product when you start the reaction.	9.19325297314631
It can be present as solvated.	11.03040288262575
But that is very difficult job; is in practical to find out rate for individual because there is so many reactions happening , different possibility.	11.545183368660663
That is the free energy of activation which is required in this whole process can also be given by e * = - rt ln keq ( 2 ) rate of reaction between a and b mind that we have not undergone the whole reaction process.	10.801818663329309
So , ration of monomer by i to the power half is this ration has not changed much , at low conversion it will not change much.	9.680971983328437
Ultimately making some generalizations from those matrix algebra , wong and hans in 1962 proposed certain set of simplified rules almost like empirical rules.	10.81284973189003
So that , you know you have some idea about how this extrusion molding is done.	9.512771467531996
And at the finally , when your molecular weight the conversion is you know quite high , there are less amount of monomer present in the reaction medium , you ramp the temperature as high as possible , you know and then you reduce the pressure as much as possible.	9.416949328871482
If you consider the whole energy of activation , part of it is contributed by entropic modifications and part by enthalpic contributions.	9.210989117998777
It influences to increase the reaction rate in a pattern of the arrhenius plot.	10.442900642483986
They selected the height of the column based on the pressure drop limitations so that don t have to face very severe pressure drops.	10.317105663857781
I will come to that.	4.559481079602128
Ea then interacts with b to give you ea b and then this gives you a product again which is y with k3 and k.	12.135547865007982
Basically this indirectly telling that the delta 1, delt 2 are same.	9.249765427228244
Now , we said this the polymers behave like this in random coil.	7.931332560560006
So that , this sheet is formed thermo can be thermo formed in the shape of the mold similarly , in injection molding machine , this is the place where the polymer melt is accumulated.	10.54028486954315
There are hundreds of polymer goes in those applications.	7.080749445453987
So , basically the light scattering techniques can be used in two ways; in static light scattering where we deal with the time average intensity of the scattered light and second technique can be used where we use the fluctuation of the static intensity in dynamic light scattering which gives the information about the radius of gyration.	8.60404003865781
Now the question is here.	9.414805470803293
When i say performance of reactor i mean the extent of conversion as a function of space time or in a batch reactor with the reaction time.	9.084464485107416
We will copolymerize by cationic method and the monomers having electron withdrawing group as a substituent under the copolymerization with ionic method.	9.128099150978258
For example , if i take a monomer like this , it can make polymers in two ways and so on , where if this is head and this is a tail , then polymer is formed by linking between head and tail and so on.	8.38557079587463
Look at this plot versus mole ratio mole percentage in the copolymer.	9.20885781381248
So that it can be used for generating , or radical polymerization is acquits medium as well , whereas a i b n can be used in the radical polymerization in organic solvents , so organic medium.	9.254846511088285
If the temperature is constant these are all constants.	10.043078047121641
Alternatively there have been attempts where the d - acyl amino acid can be chemical hydrolyzed to produce d - amino acids which are also raw material for keto acids in the pharmaceutical industry the operational stability and the regeneration of the carrier are the points which i was addressing.	9.581440931503678
Now , that approach becomes very sterically hindered because of presence of all this one one substitution.	8.742213344053422
Temperature again is a very significant parameter which must be understood.	12.444416685660713
So , this is the fraction which has reacted.	5.517146950933837
And so the probability , that any conformation will have this two reactive function groups coming close to each other , so that they can react and form ring is always very low.	9.45059913077222
For example if i consider c s , that is the terminal carbon atom which is an active center.	9.555913692650549
From the energy diagram , consider the first stage which is an uncatalyzed reaction.	9.787988676141303
The strain effects have been discussed when we were talking about the ways in which the enzyme reduces energy of activation.	7.672376318368435
Let us move on to the next topic where we determine the weight average molecular rate of the polymers and we will discuss the techniques of light scattering and subsequently gene plot to get the weight average molecular weight and also some other important parameters of polymers like the second variant coefficient and polymer solvent interaction parameters and the radius of gyration.	8.978057077141177
So , what we do statistically , we find probability of finding one length , how much and then use this term where this represent time average.	8.742217721646828
And it could be some inorganic particles as well which we which can absorb on the monomer particle size.	9.378839273559795
The moles of monomer , monomer chains , monomer consumes is given by the conversion multiplied by initiator in initial concentration of the monomer , whereas the moles of polymer chains is nothing but the moles of initiator molecules present at the beginning.	10.08824519978487
So , if the medium is non - polar and your counter ion size is lower , then there will be a possibility or there will be an intermediate formation by coordination between the anionic chain end and the incoming monomer.	8.31026806877534
Let me cut this and put this , this is value for equilibrium concentration of the free monomer , at , which is pure monomer.	11.875391210582945
Now , how a , if you have a monomer like this , c h 2, again come back to that very simple monomer.	7.980267482721441
And drop test is basically , take the specimen and drop from a certain height , which is very complex complex phenomena.	12.223461644752382
So , this actually goes down because chlorines are induced lot dipole movement.	8.761283736535738
Another important aspect which i think i will like to touch upon in today s lecture will be on enzyme classification.	9.890818794839076
If it reacts with monomer , it will form tetramer.	8.54035636902455
And the second group is where you have , 2 different monomer having 2 different bifunctional monomer; i can write a general example as in the earlier case , gives you; plus , ok; and , 2 n minus 1, h 2 o.	10.02724539675424
And that is done typically , by using by making the polymer very hydrophilic or drafting or modifying the surface using surface - active additives , surface - active additives make the surface reach with the hydrophilic polymer.	9.038210482307258
So this gives you a picture of the process economics and the contribution of different factors in the operation of an immobilized enzyme processes.	8.769216729802013
So , that will depend on the structure of the monomers and we will talk about that more in next lecture.	6.771573185616864
Only when the hydrogen ions are produced and the micro environment created by the reaction in the form of product.	8.688072871340871
We must also appreciate that while in the case of the catalytic function we understand that if the rate of reaction is increased its usefulness as a industrial catalyst is also very high because higher the rate of reaction you can very efficiently use it for industrial purposes.	9.53563792023671
We will start from this importance part in the next lecture and we will talk about the details of chain copolymerization in the next lecture.	6.731800538902148
So , in the next lecture i will continue , no why.	7.474938278874856
You are familiar that the result of these applications and developments is the science of biophysics as you know it today.	10.517709796136028
The increase in t g , which increase in size of the side groups is mainly because of the restriction of the rotation.	10.913319139466633
The orientation could be in the form of certain functional group on the substrate molecule , could also be the correct alignment of the electronic orbitals of the colliding molecules and a small departure from the optimum alignment may result in lower reaction rate or when we say lower reaction rate , increased energy of activation.	9.379783187659493
Similarly on invertase deae cellulose , 5.4 to 3.3, the immobilized enzyme optimum ph is reduced.	10.692447508098395
Again , there are many stabilizers available in the market.	7.524750299596768
In the case of michaelis menten kinetics if we put the v term which is a non - linear expression the analytical solutions are difficult and usually you approach numerical solutions which have been also reported in literature.	8.34044508019759
Now , in this case what happens , you have the same way you have h n come to that.	6.915168023956473
The volume change is significant.	10.57281135634451
So , in case of pure amorphous polymer , the expansion factor becomes 1, because there is two opposite in effect causing one intramolecular causing the chain to expand , whereas the intermolecular is trying to cause the chain to compact.	9.280501219949217
We will come back and say it again.	6.665261014990997
A liquid crystalline polymers , because they are different in homogenous in the refractive index , for a liquid polymer crystalline polymer , lcp s.	10.771876408599976
So , we will see what are the strategies we can take to make such a requirement fulfilled , so we will talk we will start from this slide in the next lecture.	7.8255975664809165
So , the x n is the average number of structure units per molecule.	7.350371455719895
This reflects probably the presence of two ionisable amino acid residues , one acidic and one basic on the enzyme active site and the profile is like this.	8.82128133480196
One of that is that the available twenty amino acids are not able to catalyze all the reactions.	9.82200024385571
Therefore one can achieve a very high catalytic efficiency in the case of enzymatic catalysis and as you notice that this efficiency is primarily achieved by two distinct factors as we saw today which are unique compared to the chemical catalyst.	10.098848970720155
You could make a log log plot and you can get the value of k and n.	7.657159294601364
So , we can write n i m i by v.	5.190847610208042
If you do above 61 degree , the m e value is even higher than the pure monomer , which means , again there is no polymerization possible.	11.013179720628793
The only difference is s represents one active site and es represents the other binding site that is occupied.	9.36241207955317
One of this is already blocked; i cannot place here.	9.080296606887368
As i mentioned the use of format dehydrogenase has an advantages that the reaction products are carbon dioxide and water which can be easily stripped off but you have to provide formate as a substrate along with it and the circles indicate no glutaraldehyde treatment and the triangles is with glutaraldehyde which very clearly indicates that the down fall is prevented and the enzyme is available over a longer period of time and reaction continues.	10.974619480916761
L . what are the experimental or analytical ways by which we can experimentally determine the rate limiting step; whether diffusion is rate limiting or not.	9.653918139569104
The issue of availability is very intrinsically linked with the applications of enzymes.	8.664394062740374
Now , if we want to look at the kinetics part for this emulsion process , let us call define n bar which is the average number of radicals in a single particle , there are many such particles.	9.35739551607432
So , this is example , this is a case of cationic polymerization.	5.851111625502723
So , this can actually coordinate with a with a cation in this case.	7.593613620218466
Similarly , if this can back bite this can back bite and abstract 1 hydrogen from here , producing c c and a ch dot here , now this can react with monomer giving branches.	9.598911245224624
They are the final property of the immobilized enzyme , kinetic property.	9.579329978347884
So , you have a polymer which is prepared in the plant which is coming either in solution or in a bulk.	6.774212048698389
And let us talk about the molecular weight of , molecular weight of the resulting polymers in , in an anionic polymerization.	8.8358447580031
So , finally , let us talk about the final expression for rate of polymerization.	6.032292994685323
Now , this is the chain polymerization that is interesting because the polymers you are making.	8.144766647340846
S * / r ).	8.87834790125697
So , if we write m; m is the fraction of pair adjacent repeat units that are present in a isotactic geometry.	8.016445279002157
So , this , this reaction , this side reaction becomes difficult.	6.787039018551282
The typical examples are the urease waste kidney that means dialysis unit , where dialysis units have been modified to include immobilized urease to facilitate the dialysis for patients who are suffering from kidney failure.	9.959020605964966
In that case the performance will be dependent not only on the magnitude of the fractional conversion but also on the magnitude of km value and the relation between s0 and km.	8.535795280997306
The method is very simple and involves two steps , activation of the matrix by steeping it in a transition metal salt solution whereby the transition metal salts form an octahedral complex.	9.51912413966047
You have k - 1, k - 2 and also k2, k.	9.78489218340427
Entrapment methods are also a very large class of enzyme immobilization methods that are based on the occlusion of an enzyme within a constraining structure.	12.491000826367928
Phi 2 is the volume fraction which is given by volume of polymer divided by total volume; this is total volume.	9.74906115384097
So therefore the tow the space velocity or the space time can be given by the same design expression which was used for idealized enzyme reactors excepting that the effectiveness factor for a case has been multiplied to the system.	8.60442934980592
Now , there is a third , third option where a growing chain can polycyclize , let us look at that option as well.	7.7111292973239
So delta will be proportional to the difference in the heat capacities , between the sample , heat capacities of the sample , and heat capacity of the reference.	8.430479502465529
But in this case , because the how does it terminate termination happens , it happens as soon as the second one gets in , so if you have a polymer particle of this size which was undergoing the propagation , now you have some second radical comes in and they will undergo immediately termination reaction.	9.164624194551175
Putting one daily for dialysis in hospital is also very difficult task because ultimately what you are doing is you are circulating the whole of his body blood through a dialysis system; it s a very tedious system if we look at and you are just putting a secondary circulation system of blood which already exist in the body.	10.2351338462509
Now , let us consider this case , the temperature is t 5, now in this case if you take any point say i will take at this point.	8.392896222529638
We will talk about the other types of additives , like this fire retardants , how they work.	8.532596851080001
And , other module of polymer crystallines is spherulite; where these polymer crystallites are arranged in this manner.	9.679116463241721
Until then from the residual mixture we were isolating l - amino acid and the balance was almost wasted.	11.559428919340847
Now , do not confuse , that activation energy for reaction is negative.	7.982402310099037
The limitation is on the electron acceptors.	12.728428438974836
Now , these are for for case if one polymer is formed from one kinetic chain which means termination by disproportionation or by transfer this is apply to this.	8.768848456123802
Their activity or their function in the normal temperature range also put sometimes a disadvantageous situation in the sense that at those temperatures many of the microbial activities are also optimum and therefore they lead to contamination of products and therefore their industrial application becomes restricted.	11.044663070291522
This is a case of cationic polymerization and this two are the case of anionic polymerization.	7.992938922153837
You will notice that it is analogues to your michaelis menten kinetics.	7.725484239110476
Any therapeutic device must take care of these problems if it has to be effective.	12.337121137866815
This polyelectrolyte is then mixed with the enzyme solution and this mixture is then added drop wise with addition into a solution of counter ions.	9.985403567555151
Now the other test also there , which have done in a real applications , where basically , which is been guided by u l laboratories.	12.091940011446123
It also experiences high product concentration.	7.499749590823988
So , in the bulk polymerization as this is the point where the t g as become lower t g of that polymer present in this case as become higher then the reaction temperature if the reaction temperature is 60 degree in this case 50 degree.	12.453223854306149
So , this is the conclusion or let us conclude the molecular weight determination by light scattering.	8.10590802344885
X a being polymer , consider poly ethylene , you have another chain , it could be dead chain dead polymer.	11.469018994888211
The nature of amino acid has a very important role to play in the conformation.	9.122524869691146
They are only the steps which are involved in formation of e.	8.250744288293337
Whereas when there are scatterer size is much higher , then the polymer is become completely opaque.	11.868858882633583
So , if you compare the values and put a third monomer m m a methyl methacrylate which is again a electron accepting monomer and let us see whether it is more generic.	8.875124216836197
So , when you add monomers there are very small fractions of monomer present in a soluble , in a water medium , is very a small fraction of present as as a soluble inside the surfactant micelle.	9.443125600436055
If the heat is , you cannot effectively remove the heat which is getting generated by this exothermic polymer reaction then it will accumulate and it will increase the temperature local temperature.	10.458564656276799
Secondly , it depends up on the chemical structure or chain stiffness.	10.544041773381569
Let us take another step where you are taking these octamers reacting with octamers forming this 16 mar which is of , which will come around 125 numbers gives you 6.25 functional group 93.75 conversion percentage and degree of polymers is 1.	10.42526615094286
Because the starch product is low molecular weight glucose similarly cellular product is also glucose.	10.229647803552785
As we mentioned in most cases , we write polymer chains like this or something like this , never we write this , because polymer chains as we have seen , they are having single bond where rotation occurs in bond are possible.	9.975817529455064
That means if suppose you want to know how we can determine the actual value of the mass transfer coefficient.	8.596595308660408
And then some other specific examples like anti - glare , anti - piracy , these are the some examples , where surface - active agents are used.	7.816362293412576
This is you all of us know , the electromagnetic radiation , and this is the increasing wavelength , so this is left hand side is increasing frequency , which makes this increasing energy , and this is a short wavelength it can penetrate atom , so we can study extra refraction using x - rays here.	10.138384491524926
It also plays a role in substrate binding and the role of cofactor is absolutely essential.	11.254599701596652
It could be r 1 could be less than 1 or r 2 could be less than .	7.681304757720553
Now you can argue that the carbon which is almost at the end and on near to the end group and obviously in the end , there will be some functional group and the other side will be the rest of the polymer chain.	10.366129390604605
First we introduced the polymer molecules one by one in case of each polymer molecule , segment by segment and then once all the polymers molecules were introduced in the lattice , then we added all the solvents.	12.114857919623882
So , basically when , a light travels through a material , in this case a plastic material or a polymer material.	7.874180286724492
So , if we got this , and you can write b r p by r t or r p by r t by b.	8.386004381132933
If you make different preparation with different enzyme loadings the reaction rate will be proportional to the enzyme loading.	8.627191226254716
So any face change , which involves any glass transaction or melting , which is endothermic processes , will require more heat , to maintain the temperature , and ideally this should be a sharp increase here.	10.751223933890419
So , basically below this temperature everything is soluble , in a polymer soluble at every composition so if i take that flory - huggins expression this one and flory - huggins expression this one and write the conditions from for spinodal id equal to 0, you get the spinodal points like 1 1 minus pie 2 plus.	9.509435817650727
Therefore the fractional conversion , whatever we have discussed about relative quantity of enzyme or the space time as a function of fractional conversion a reverse phenomena or the reverse behavior is true for productivity.	9.584262431656018
And you must continue the reaction for long time , because the kinetics is lower and also is always preferred is always preferable to have a high equilibrium constant , which will depend upon the reactive.	10.304040066664287
We will now determine on the number of polymer molecules present in the solution; number of polymer molecules , which will give you m n , because m n is what concerns the number of polymer molecules.	9.9941643485191
The same analysis as we did earlier if you consider for zero order kinetics the tau is equal to.	11.914260302972062
So , w which is the total number of ways the entire 3d lattice containing n 1 solvent molecules and n 2 polymer molecules can be filled by this way.	8.317107673418167
Welcome back , and we will start this tenth lecture , and we will continue our discussion on radical chain polymerization.	5.933622264273472
Starch hydrolysis also shows a similar behavior; gelatinous it is not insoluble like particulate matter , but still it is in the form of a gel and after you cook the starch you get a gel and the gel has to be reacted with the soluble enzyme to carry out the liquefaction.	11.241595961774872
L - aspartic acid is a molecule which is used in the food industry and pharmaceutical industry and this can be produced by an aspartase , enzyme lyase which acts on fumaric acid and ammonia to give you the l - aspartic acid and the work was reported by tosa and others in biotech bioengineering in 197.	10.745274178429082
For example , if we give a specific example if we have impurities , what were the impurities present in our polymer sample and we analyze that sample.	8.37205204455246
A simple reaction mechanism can be expressed like e + s es e + p + s ess we can write exactly in our nomenclature of k1, k - 1, k2 and this equilibrium of the second substrate binding can be expressed by dissociation constant of ks , individual rate constant being ks and k - s.	9.109998832639324
It is the functional property.	8.679189011913067
So , 1 c h 2 group 1 c o group and one motoring carbon in case of these are the groups there in this polymer , then values of these are separate these the contribution of these groups have already tabulated or theoretically find out by scientists like small and hoy , you have to just take those values and add up to get the this value.	10.80734426340151
We are using the terms size and shape.	10.528272573447033
We then move to a step polymerization in a open and driven system , where it is not possible to completely remove the condensate out of the system.	8.847178987366487
And sometimes with this sort of trialkyl aluminium chloride or say dialkyl aluminum chloride , sometimes these electron donors are added.	9.994381327408886
So the effective concentration of the substrate at which the reaction is taking place is much smaller than the substrate inlet stream concentration and therefore such reactions will be ideally suited for the enzyme catalyzed reactions which are strongly substrate inhibited because the effective substrate concentration in the reactor will be much lesser than the actual substrate concentration in the feed stream.	9.245619891922832
What they were talking was with crude enzymes preparations and so the observations they could get were very limited.	10.556373265312184
How many tetramer would be there.	10.615154213380073
If one has to really study various methods i think one must compare the various methods and to evaluate various methods for a particular job then these are the parameters which are needed to be looked into.	10.743966827090755
But , this is the case where keeping the monomer concentration fixed , you can increase the polymerization rate without compromising the molecular weight , or you can increase the molecular weight without compromising the compromising the polymerization.	10.286513120496867
The simplest way to do that was that these non linear equations if they could be converted by some means , by some modification , into a straight line relationship life will be much easier to analyze experimental data and the first attempt for that was given by lineweaver and burk.	10.962657625987191
Also important is that , it should not generate toxics smoke; that is also important.	10.292787988813945
Now , how do you get , how this this is produced.	7.512508098925183
Now again this will be just briefed , we will have a brief discussion on this properties , and subsequent properties.	11.026147586337009
In the monometallic case , we are talking about the chain insertion or the chain growth happening in the titanium carbon bond.	7.332467545993421
But if you increase the time 4 times , you are only double increasing molecular weight for a same catalyst reaction.	8.049400413164843
So , if then what happens , this this material fill the mold with this gas in a foam a foam in between.	8.201385615986295
As a result of this , the average number average degrees of polymerization or the molecular weight will definitely come down.	6.706458153970671
So for example let us say if this z is much , much smaller than the height required for biochemical reaction then you don t have to worry about diffusion.	7.97038605458743
So , very specialized equipment s are made.	8.533459085114588
So , with this we come to the end of discussion on gel permeation chromatography.	6.028243629303885
But in situation where the sample to be analyzed are in very large number and very often such instances are met in hospitals and in clinical laboratories where few hundreds of samples everyday are encountered and use of soluble enzyme may be some times uneconomical.	10.154274848670212
Rate of polymerization will be given by k p m and concentration of the radical which is given by k p m k i cu plus by cu 2 plus.	7.891599861348753
So , rate of polymerization molecule is high and because you are not using any other chemical solvents or other things this gives you high purity polymers and gives you minimum contamination of the product.	9.381551174264782
Second , a specific viscosity of the individual chains can be obtained by this expression.	8.342708445209977
The concentration of e species will be a fraction which will be given by such an expression.	9.667076569718441
A hydrogen bond is formed between the - nh group and the - c0 group in the chain at a distance by four amino acid residues.	10.569208191489045
There will be invariably some additives added and they can be mixed well and if there are color master batch or some other master batch , they can be added here.	10.762511127324027
It is retained in the semi permeable hollow fiber tubes so that it is not able to go out almost similar to microencapsulation where the enzyme is contained in the forms of tubes.	10.730836552177278
As they are not very regular what happen.	12.19683567129437
So , this was first practiced by bruno zimm.	8.327504816046993
So , you get total mass n i m i dived by total number of moles which gives you molecular mass , molar mass , mass in the , mass gram per mol.	8.54206646340707
So , all these are examples of condensation polymers , where the polymer is made from condensation reaction of the monomers.	8.00728387293834
So , as the maximum theoretically possible length one polymer can have , if just put all the bonds , all bonds in straight line one after one.	8.289320940761426
If the mass transfer has to be incorporated this much of length of the reactor is required under these operational conditions to have the substrate concentration equivalent to biochemical reaction.	9.68536020003726
If the polymer for example , if it is very stiff , the rotation between the single bond , around the single bond is restricted , then the mobility of the polymers comes down.	9.955775065751252
Say you talk about say alkyl metal initiator you have a alkyl metal initiator , say i take a ethylene oxide.	12.395556324409078
This will depend on the relative rate of diffusion vis - - vis , the rate of biochemical catalysis.	9.251005308735838
So , polymers are used in the applications where the final form of the product is in solution form.	9.052738237316772
You can use the enzyme in the bulk lower ph although the actual ph of the active site will be same 7.5 or 8 whatever is the optimum ph of the native enzyme.	8.725618298235606
You digest the protein sample with concentrated sulphuric acid in the presence of a catalyst.	8.536217755081715
When you take lower substrate concentration , 0.2m the activity loss is much , much higher and over the same period of time instead of 50 % it reaches to about 25 % and this is the case where if you recall we discussed the substrate dependent enzyme decay.	10.716039088895196
So , this is in that sense not a transfer reaction and it is a true sense a termination reaction , and you can just note down the example of this termination reaction.	9.634738404469115
There are hundreds of such examples i can give , maybe i will give in later classes , but i hope you are convinced that polymers is finding applications in several places and now a days when we talk about you know we , a scientist or the developer you know application specialist with thing for a new material application.	9.685530568519988
One is the binding process which is not influenced which is elaborated by our dissociation constant.	8.693632135220263
The biosynthesis of enzymes in any living system is exactly the same as biosynthesis of any protein.	9.97075232241067
Again the reactor was started and this can also be done by using multiple columns and instead of using a single column of large capacity one can breakdown the total volume in smaller capacities and stagger operation.	10.331969025072642
As conventional practice we take the two reaction velocity as 0.9 vm and 0.1 vm.	10.901292533762462
You can immobilize the whole cell as long as you do not inactivate other contaminating enzymes in the cell which will interfere in the process.	9.247538304949005
A typical reaction is shown here.	6.857305641940799
This is chain initiating radical or species.	8.834141502629668
In both cases , these 2 radical , propagating radical reacting and forming dead polymer.	8.355825119855092
In the case of unimolecular reactions this entropic contribution will not be very significant.	7.595594032325293
It is quite logical that in such cases it will be mostly the ionic species like glycine or glutamic acid or proteic acid will be the functional group that will be responsible for acid base catalysis.	11.450855561779171
So if that happens , then the polymer chain have much less mobility compared to a much flexible chain.	11.131363987377124
This is your intercept and the intercept 1 / vm on the y axis is increased by a factor of ( 1 + i / ki ).	6.33638299382707
If your electron withdrawing group , then this double bond will be electron deficient.	10.546090689407198
In fact one of the most successful attempts has been to use cyclodextrins.	9.166152767449159
You have sb here; you reached ss; there is no substrate concentration gradient but then here onwards there is a gradient.	10.613736074669216
The first condition will be the enzyme kinetics where substrate inhibition is very strong.	11.915875995480967
Typical example is acetone , water mixture.	10.084061092414634
For example , in the beginning , we talked about butylenes styrene rubber lower or in the butylenes styrene rubber as such this is the example of co polymer , very common applications of polystyrene.	10.414220754834766
One of the typical factors here is that in addition to the enzyme binding a carboxylic group is also generated which means an additional charge , a free charge on the immobilized enzyme preparation and this negative charge gives sometimes undesirable properties to the preparation and sometime it can effect unfavorably the stability of the enzyme.	8.986816011936073
So , if the there are branching happening because of inter molecular chain transfer as gel effect then p d i goes up and it could be as high as 20 to 5.	10.545486178794292
So , i quickly integrate this expression , d cooh by d t is k m cube; minus , this we can put m; minus m by m cube is k d t.	9.485545397450359
At the end , if there are excess m 2, you get free monomers.	8.71850847325194
So , we cannot use this calibration curve , but most of the times we may we use one set of calibration curve for lot of other polymers which gives us error may be 0 to 30 percent error in terms of the molecular weight.	8.989323670554366
What we are measuring is the conversion at the effluent.	11.292165791596785
That is one of limitations although the protein design or the enzyme design has been so beautifully evolved that a large variety of reactions can be catalyzed but still there are limitations.	8.550620252206599
This is the concentration of the substrate in one element of the age dt between t and t + dt and the fraction of the exit stream which is half the age between t + dt that means during the time dt and if you multiply the two you get the mean concentration of substrate in the exit stream and if you sum it up this one over all the elements or integrate it s bar will be equal to t equal to zero to infinity s element into edt.	9.032495441786079
So , you can say that whether the other functional group , it present in other end of the molecule , whether that is reacted or not , that does not determine the reactivity of the other side , as the function group is in other side.	9.360642152984076
If you talk about say eye drop you have polymer in aqueous solutions with salt and other ingredients.	8.269446116919626
The quantity of enzyme required and the space time are almost analogous parameters.	7.839762582781118
This loss of enzyme activity could be real or could be apparent.	10.418789243015638
So , if you compare this dimension , which is basically we are calling this 0, this whole meaning that the rms end - to - end distance for polymer chains which is both bond angle restriction , and also rotational restriction around the single bond , due to short range steric interaction; and this terms we are calling as unperturbed dimension , they are 1.4 times , and multiplied by this time , so it will be around 2 to 3 times.	8.124527522843646
There are two kinds of situation one is that these active sites on these oligomeric enzymes might be identical and independent.	9.966680578342423
For example , if i take a monomer of this sort.	5.9588028661443255
So , number of functional group reacted , now when one molecule disappears how many number of function group is reacting.	8.244428893587548
Just to reiterate the assumptions , the major assumption which were made here are formation of e - s complex.	8.420615143858605
So , if you can minimize these impurities , the chain transfer agent or any vital which actually kills the radicals , then you can have this radical polymerization process done easily.	8.685920419880462
So , each segment have z minus 1 contact.	5.547469686549906
For example , if i talk about methyl methacrylate , like this is the form to difference this.	8.096680707559807
The other factor is cost which is again an undesirable feature which probably applies to any commodity we want to use for industrial purposes.	9.343384605599589
You will get a straight line because slope will be equal to slope = km / vm ( 1 + i / ki ) therefore one can determine the value or magnitude of ki either by plotting the slope verses the inhibitor concentration or by intercept.	7.442815901755305
I think the first and foremost and probably the most trivial function that could be understood is to get a certain optimum set of parameters for carrying out the reaction.	8.444731668974041
Now , what he got.	8.283876574018269
Again the heating can be done at in air , or intent atmosphere , like the nitrogen gas or organ gas.	10.561902485734375
Now , vigorous stirring form this monomer droplets into small size , which is around this 100 to 500 microns and they are remain they remains stable , because they are surrounded or absorbed by the dispersion molecules.	10.812698404962017
So , basically with increase in the molecular weight , the t g goes up to certain point.	7.230443143627387
You know there is no choice for a polymer chemist other than continues the reaction for almost similar time to get a high enough molecular weight.	8.911850650395081
For example , with highly elastic polymers like rubbers , they have low modulus 7 mainly about 7 mpa , stiff polymers which have higher modulus about 4 gpa and metals is is much higher , if you compare a polymer and metal , metal is much more higher modulus.	10.256046915076535
Therefore based on the observed reaction velocity in the case of an immobilized enzyme reactor one can determine the value of sb - ss that is the substrate concentration gradient and the magnitude of this determines whether the reaction is diffusional limited or otherwise.	10.221584255349372
Proper choice of solvent , you must be taken and you need , because this reaction is happening interface.	13.033431551662234
This effectiveness factor is the ratio of the rate of actual reaction in the matrix divided by the maximum reaction rate obtainable if there was no pore diffusional resistance.	10.77451988561859
So , we have to know r i.	6.007397186804268
Now , come to uv - visible spectroscopy or just talk about in this course , we are not going into details about this spectroscopic techniques , because these are very basic techniques; what i will just mention basic few basic like points , and then tell you what is the application of this particular spectroscopy in terms of polymer characterization.	11.50123491501101
Here we have 29 % but still 29 % is the highest and probably one has to accept it.	10.097263406578598
Now , in most cases , in most practical cases , to make a high molecular polymer , you have to take this condenser out , because this is a equilibrium reaction , reversible action.	8.817757573549361
But , their polarity is different.	8.233794493457768
So generally if nothing is mentioned.	11.838197251091145
We can also determine a 2 by plotting or getting or determining a 2 at different temperature; with this expression from the slope we can get a .	9.703520911273595
So , this is the expansion factor because of the polymer solvent interaction.	8.702210611593545
Lineweaver and burk made a very simple approach.	15.767205416685812
That is one case which illustrates the use of reaction kinetics for the design of or for the analysis of the reactor performance for any given practical enzyme catalyzed reaction which is not a theoretical one but which has been used practically and the process of the system is commercially used all over the world.	10.756119172526756
And next point is managing the high viscosity.	9.696653630527432
Let us talk about fire retardant and we had earlier about 2, 3 lectures , earlier we discussed the fire retardant and the evaluation techniques , and how do we measure the fire retardant properties of a polymer samples.	9.833664538905408
So , that is a reason there act as a inhibitor molecule.	6.969831864041356
So there are two approaches by which these preparations are made by changing the solubility variables like solvent , temperature , ph and ionic strength or the cross linking reactions.	9.324006918211103
This can be initiation; can be done by photo initiation of olium salts.	10.33264616947141
For example if you want to carry out a conversion of let us say a 95 % leaving back 5 % of the substrate that means the concentration of the substrate in the reactor will be only 5 % of that of the feed inlet.	8.528130480130525
I will take a few examples to illustrate and the first and the simplest method is diazo binding.	9.383724557632716
Last we just go back and look go back and look at the big picture a bird s - eye view of the polymers , polymers applied when they met their are may be solution are in bulk they are synthesized in solution polymerization , they can be synthesized in bulk like a milk condensation polymerization.	9.916095189169171
The modulus which means , the stiffness or rigidity , very much depends on the temperature , as i said so , this is the example , how the modules changes with temperature.	10.951062230022874
Another class is thermosets , where a polymer is made in c.	12.950696210585672
These zeigler - natta polymers or coordinated polymers get terminated.	10.04612904212139
Now , that is very important concept and here the primary radical or the propagating radical , they will move into the micelle core , and start the reaction immediately the polymerization reaction , rather than entering this monomer droplets.	9.814924188423932
Quaternary structure has relevance in the case of oligomeric proteins that means the proteins that consist of more than one polypeptide chain.	12.570160727249718
Now for pure solvent and solute , what will be the w.	10.11644462565952
Another major important factor is better integration with the chemical steps in synthetic sequence where you want to use enzyme as a part of a sequence of reactions in an organic chemical synthesis where the substrate is coming already dissolved in organic solvent you can always integrate enzymatic reaction in the sequence of steps.	10.416706626322279
So , this does not contain the unreacted monomer.	7.151688308147398
So the effect of ph on the km value can be noted to look at the pattern of inhibition.	8.226438166362968
And we also know that the gibbs free energy mixing can be expressed in terms of enthalpy of mixing and entropy of mixing.	7.99184174464196
It will be part of it or trace of which will be remaining.	10.927870790716431
So , this is the flask of the incoming light , and if i consider phi u n , is the flux of light , transmitted and deviated , from its original path.	8.722750470844058
As a result , there is a huge increase in the concentration of these active centers in the medium and as a result , the reaction is very fast.	8.549435743516876
So that gives you another major advantage for using an immobilized preparation.	8.154343908934802
Temperature dependent on terms of the rate constant k p , k d and k t and same , as you can do this and do the same exercise what we did for the thermal initiation and see what is the value of e r in this case.	10.269385688680261
You can draw yourself.	10.763554045004549
So , what is practically done is basically you you add the more reactive monomer , which is getting incorporated in the chain mass in a faster rate.	8.028420409219432
Propagation , we have already seen the different types of initiation possibility and as i said , we will consider the generic case , we , as i showed there.	11.159871161911397
For example , i have molecule like this , or you can have benzyl ketals , benzyl ketals where you have structure of that like this.	8.624572240522278
The enzyme is in structure confirmationally which is very much complimentary to the transition state of the substrates and by binding that it stabilizes those transition complex.	9.336366705316152
That means if you take a soluble enzyme , add to a carrier and allow it by any method of immobilization we get two streams - one will be residual enzyme activity in the supernatant which is left uncoupled and immobilized enzyme preparation.	8.425655461667747
Now the amount of mass is remaining after complete bonding , is what , is char , what is the char , means formation after heating , and that is very important when you talk about the flammability , and fame resistant behavior of the polymer.	10.231582995299238
As a result , you have different monomers altogether.	10.287947448359118
So , the contribution become higher and if the volume becomes higher theres no polar groups the volume becomes higher there is more vander wall forces between them which also , increases the cohesive interaction between the groups.	9.564805230888025
And in that way , we found the dependency of polymerization rate on initiator concentration as well as dependency of polymer rate on monomer concentration.	9.48251375609058
If this two have same molecular weight obviously if you have branches then it will have more compact structure.	9.159891817773106
How polymers are you know named and also i will talk about give you a prospective of the molecular weight of polymers.	9.04461669904988
We require very , stringest , stringent conditions , which are difficult to achieve in a large industrial scale and also , this ionic polymerization are very selective , which means , that not every monomer can be polymerized by ionic polymerization , unlike , unlike radical case where most of the , poly , monomers , double bond monomers can be polymerized by radical chain polymerization we can assume.	10.293480691852524
Then stop the reaction take out the polymer and restart the reaction again.	11.985645360287002
This will require many of the functional groups to be present on the carrier.	9.846287883429069
These are the standard kind of inhibition patterns which we are familiar with; substrate inhibition or a product inhibition which is non competitive or competitive.	9.207468307069723
So it is always given these and this choice , because the presence of this stabilizing group y as a substituent.	10.91103711576012
If you are plotting here log m v , now you are again targeting m v for the unknown molecules.	9.594892902623412
This , this goes to left hand side , so in by and increase the proportion of contact ion - pair in this equilibrium and by that it decreases the rate of the reaction in non - polar solvent.	10.213576054591757
Finally the double reciprocal plot of 1 / s verses 1 / v at different inhibitor concentrations followed by a secondary plot of slope verses inhibitor concentration can be used to determine the magnitude of km , vm and ki for a reaction which involves competitive inhibitor.	8.994020900910655
These materials can be dissolved along with the enzyme and then polymerization can be started by exposing them to ultra violet light at 360nm for few minutes and then in few minutes the reaction is over and the gel preparation containing the enzyme molecule is made available.	11.028342482435216
Of course , if you go back and see this one if this is low for a given m e , this will be lower because this more or less same.	10.45161363967394
This is nothing but sort of plasticizing effect.	9.08878507602799
Otherwise you have to go to the matrix algebra to solve the simultaneous equations and you will arrive at the same thing.	10.666425458641225
The other category of enzyme reactor , fluidized bed reactor , as i mentioned earlier are much better suited for heat and mass transfer characteristics and freedom from plugging.	10.03849751081117
So , now what we will do is we will explain or we will try to learn how the paul flory , huggins theory was established using that same lattice theory which we just learnt for small molecules.	8.323547207421534
So , x n bar is n 0 by n , which means n a by 2 1 plus 1 by r divided by n a by 2, 1 plus 1 r minus 2 p which leads to 1 plus r 1 plus r minus 2 r p.	8.819024086992334
The same anylate whatever substrate concentration , the change of temperature which is measured in terms of change in resistance is related to the change of substrate concentration.	10.162342203841384
The only difference is here the definition of vm must be taken as 2k2. e0 or in another words if it is a multimeric protein or enzyme where n binding sites are there , it can become n . k2.e0 otherwise the treatment can be identical as in the case of a hyperbolic profile.	10.2368322093198
And , in this lecture , this tenth lecture , i will try to complete the discussion on the different type of radical initiator , which we began in the last lecture , and briefly talk about the initiator efficiency.	8.9447041059097
And , there are additives like dibutyl tin maleate , which basically break up the conjugated double bond , and prevent the degradation further.	9.861815296226364
So , you will get essentially homo polymer of styrene at the beginning at the beginning.	6.481421690201218
In fact one of the earlier references in mass transfer analysis of an immobilized glucose oxidase particles was made and is given in this.	9.210909713882774
The definite ratio of protein to carrier will play a particular equilibrium behavior and higher the protein concentration you can reach nearer the saturation level at equilibrium.	10.13186157265615
We will spend most time on emulsion polymerization and so let us start about the bulk polymerization.	8.960617376995248
We will consider today mainly the ionization of amino acid residues on the active site which is primarily a major factor which influences the typical reaction profile that you are familiar with of the effect of ph on the enzyme.	8.266530811607923
With time , with conversion , the monomer composition the monomer composition will have less and less m 1 because m 1 is getting incorporated in the chain in faster rate.	8.517427394335849
Vm / ( 1 + i / ki ) v0 = km + s one can very clearly visualize that the effect of a non - competitive inhibitor is to influence the maximum reaction velocity and maximum reaction velocity is reduced by factor of ( 1 + i / ki ) whereas the km value remains unchanged.	7.697170853465662
If during the binding process , the reactant or the substrate has to undergo some change in shape in order to fit very snugly into the active site there might be some distortion or strain on one of the bonds which is required to be broken.	10.386451153666004
So , if you increase the mobility , obviously polymer chain becomes more flexible , and t g goes down.	5.724980987577096
And in case of by the mechanism which you can synthesize polymer you can divide polymer into two classes by step polymerization or by chain growth polymerization.	9.18917586488349
They can be classified in a very general way on the basis of their mode of charging and discharging of the substrate and product stream.	8.900572033187565
Obviously , r 1 r 2 would be greater than .	8.025416611347366
Reaction has not progressed too much so the concentration of monomer and concentration of initiator has not changed much.	10.334559343580786
How the separation happens.	9.477156946970705
You just simply think that , say if you have 50 of your students , i ask to occupy 5 benches.	11.595696950662688
In this case all the monomers are same so we name these polymers; we term these polymers as homo polymers.	8.804387711716961
Ph electrode is a transducer , one of the transducers which can be used in the case of an enzyme electrode.	9.921807149787762
We have seen that when r is not close to 1, the molecular rate becomes slower.	9.334741207089715
And then went randomly , did a random of fixed step length of one length , and then using radial distribution function gaussian , what is the probability that the other end would be at a distance r from the origin.	8.673696170240351
Now , you have to increase the temperature slowly because as you build up the molecular weight as the reaction goes , the viscosity of the medium builds.	9.36031009123901
And then we found out that during chain polymerization it is always head tail arrangement , head tail head tail type arrangements is always exclusively preferred.	9.117413253993963
Now , what is , the second point is that , the reactivity of one functional group is independent of the other function group present in the molecule; which means , whether the other functional group is reacted or not , if we have bi functional molecule with 2 functional group two side; now reactivity of one functional group is independent the other.	8.994766159354546
The other type of interaction is scattering , and optical rotation , the sample might change the rotational rotation or polarization of the sample causing change in optical rotation of the light.	9.60547779720377
We will come back and look at little more deep on the polymer solvent interaction.	7.105757418014411
Now when r 1 and r 2 is r 1 is r 2 is .	7.954666954441471
Some polymers are of course , very costly , that gives you very good performance , but more often not the polymers gives you , comes with a lower cost.	10.105476040872794
For example the interactions that are involved are non - specific , very often more than one interaction is involved in a particular method , multivariant that means more than one physical property is employed.	10.75132263014439
Then , if you want to know the reaction leads for each and individual steps and then finally , sum them to get the final rate; that is practically a impossible task.	9.8450232379277
We form this polyester.	11.544554897810343
So steric hindrances are further decreased and therefore particularly with those enzymes which are known to have steric hindrances during immobilization , the ones which use much larger polymers as the substrate , for those systems the method is very significant.	9.70883713396348
The salt you know we said that neutral polymers need that distance from the salt to become cationize and for example , this polyesters , polyamides , polyether s whereas , hetero atom; salts like sodium , potassium , lithium s are used , because these cations are alkyl metal cations can attach with this hetero atom and cationize this polymer.	10.288914713205418
So , if you have a transfer reaction going on , then the increase in temperature will affect more , it will decrease the molecular weight more in comparison where there is no transfer reaction going on.	8.915994027227718
If you introduced a phenyl width in the back bone , your stiffness will go up , and you get a much higher t m value , increased t m value as a result of increase in the back bone polymer chain stiffness.	9.30254913433538
You can take styrene and m m a , and get numerous amount of copolymers , if you mixed , them in different proportion styrene is to m m a use can get 10 is to 90, 90 is to 10, 50 is to 50, so you can get numerous number of copolymers , and also you can choose their different types of , the different sets of monomers.	11.248482744843228
While we talk of a yield we must keep into mind the residual activity in the supernatant.	11.365424906686574
And the propagation step is completed by insertion of the coordinated monomer in the metal , transition metal carbon bond as we discussed now.	10.240908309381018
From transition state some bonds have to break some has to form.	10.709066095823598
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
Similarly in the case of hydrolysis of sucrose by invertase also by one of the possible mechanistic models when one substrate molecule binds , the enzyme substrate complex leads to a product formation.	9.630843017108255
Now it is a electron withdrawing group , which means that , because this is present the reactivity of this double bond towards a electro file , increases , and also if there is a anionic charge here , which can be easily stabilized by the resonating effect of the nitrate group.	10.352395441210874
We will continue our discussion on polymer molecular weight determination from our last class.	6.433934915219671
I initiated this side is initiator which is this initiator is this and cu plus which is this.	9.996377798338072
So these are the various methods that we have discussed today.	7.300769536007549
It will not be at ph .	12.584866792772903
One needs to choose the enzyme and its further processing for purification so as to have the three properties which are in the positive region and we choose the soluble enzymes on that basis.	11.086291616034831
Now this can , for the same reason , this is preferred , compared to this.	10.241811042512964
Klam k2e0 sb we have two different conditions of the lineweaver burk plot; one in the case where sb is very high and the lineweaver burk plot will have the slope as km / vm on the other hand when the substrate concentration is very low the slope will be 1 / klam + km / vm.	9.646491053321567
And finally , different commercial polymers you know student have a idea at least you should not i do not expect that a master of all the polymers , step polymers there as many step polymers.	10.003794287042112
In the last lecture we had discussed michaelis menten kinetics as applicable to enzyme catalyzed reactions and also the proposed modifications by briggs and haldane , whereby he confirmed the formation of enzyme substrate complex and the steady state hypothesis with respect to the formation of es complex and that the enzyme substrate complex is in steady state soon after the reaction starts.	9.175813165876168
Some optimum ph changes have also been reported in the case of crosslinking but their effect of change in the optimum ph is a result of some other conformational interactions and not due to partitioning.	11.07370487916611
That is the component which biology will make us understand.	8.839569456467842
Now besides the glass transition temperature and melting point , the other behavior polymer material can show is the heat distortion temperature , or has a softening temperature , and very high temperature , above of t m , when if you keep raising the temperature k if you keep raising the temperature , the polymer might decompose and gives decomposition temperature.	9.81289921637377
Now , what is the chance that the other cells are solvent molecules.	6.341955790481437
If this alpha methyl styrene is converted to a polymer obviously because of this presence of this groups the polymer will be much more strained compared to the monomer which is a planer molecules.	10.027668088532614
Out of the methods available , which we will discuss subsequently , if we have to choose an immobilization method to use for a specific application there are four distinct parameters which should be looked into.	11.233682754357586
But once a preparation has been made with a definite amount of steric hindrance , the loss is real.	11.313638294883985
Now you can think two type of special arrangement; one is transoid where these two double bonds are in trans and one is cisoid.	10.158756563690261
So , there are two advantages we must remember using this calibration once that this is always reported with some non - standards gather always some error and if the calibration cub is done with linear polymers if we find or determine molecular weights of other shapes using that calibration cub there will be also error.	10.778621787398023
What is done a styrene butadiene rubber is used , where a rubber butadiene having a low t g it gives a rubbery domains in the copolymers and as a result this copolymer can becomes rubbery or elastomeric.	10.406207165704233
It is basically the intensity; it is basically the scattering intensity which is normalized with the scattering angle.	8.788813652335177
So obviously you have to produce them on a very small scale and producing on small scale will lead to high cost of production.	12.120840630783967
If you look at variety of industrial processing that go in processing of foods , animal feeds those industrial factors which use primarily natural products as the feed stocks our enzymes are going to play a major role in those industries where the feed stock or raw materials are from natural source.	9.643914916034456
But in this case it is much higher , so 0.1 to 3 weight percent and of course , this concentration are quite high , and it is far greater than the critical micelle aggregation critical micelle aggregation concentration , cmc of the surfactant.	9.79860542247785
So , they will again try to contract.	8.55204151902297
Just to repeat what what i covered in this class , we talked about the definition of what are polymers.	8.479454227765588
When i say absolute specificity i mean that the enzyme can recognize only one substrate.	9.470408088482916
So , if you compare the reaction of styrene plus vinyl acetate , this radical form vinyl acetate high reactive and in this case , styrene monomer.	8.109911382948017
And p theta value is 1 at 0 theta equals to 0, because you do not see any destructive interference and for all other angles p theta become less than one , and it becomes more and more small as we increase the theta.	10.660518634203678
You can do the polymerization only with a monomer and we call it a bulk polymerization.	8.092377462310584
Now , how do you determine seniority.	5.937325304813737
So , we can now write nu k p m k d k t to the power half from the last expression.	6.733138779775131
How to define its specificity or compare specificity of the enzyme with respect to different substrates.	11.741851947664255
So , if you cool a polymer sample , they can crystallize partly in this temperature or if they do not crystallize at all and if further reduced , then they can undergo , the viscosity can go up , they can become a rubbery material.	10.075636852744948
And do it in a much higher temperature , then you are going to get a mixture of isotactic and syndiotactic component.	10.055872663038635
That is a reason , it is always very difficult to get a poly conversion reaction by a self catalyst reaction , we always add , we always , typically in practice , we always add catalyst from outside.	9.94349602704638
So , f is the number of functional group present in this molecule.	6.29993035599177
But these are techniques and not used much; nowadays these techniques are not used much for several reasons though mainly this techniques like osmotic membrane osmometry and vapor pressure osmometry are used and as we have discussed that they are complimentary to each other where membrane osmometry can determine molecular weight , number of molecular weight for little higher range and vapor pressure osmometry can be used for determining molecular rates of low molecular weights of lower range.	11.099835694516134
Dx =.	15.59336823246223
We can write this generic structure of h - t with active hydrogen.	9.398984997498435
So , we can assume that the rates of this individual steps are different , and first it was proposed by flory , and which is proposed as the equal reactivity of functional group , functional groups; flory , who proposed first.	8.897312798235546
Many of the enzymes when they are coupled to a solid matrix may not be able to interact with the substrate because of steric hindrance.	8.241864243267585
So , we; so , these are the polymer generally require protection against oxidation , light , and protection again against a uv light and thermal degradation , etcetera.	9.79501806784805
There are both kinds of effects because the preparation can be made to be both diffusion limited as well as if the enzyme loading is not very high it can be biochemical reaction limited also and the activation energy measurements will indicate that figure.	10.744258884714075
They could exist depending upon the polarity of the medium.	5.865881874483499
And in this case we have seen or we have discussed in last lecture that the rate of initiation is typically much lower compared to the rate at which the chain propagates and completes.	9.578157337230387
The same job can be done by immobilized enzyme in a more controlled way and you can have controlled hydrolysis.	11.260400969325303
Remember , that the molecular weight was proportional to , related to the initial monomer concentration n .	11.75925774664544
Now , you can see this , in this case you always have a group at the end.	7.010440021277841
A generalized rate expression for this was proposed by alberty based on steady state hypothesis.	11.020352962982178
So let us talk about first this example; polythene have t m around 137 to 146 degree centigrade.	7.837493333212139
Instead of the enzyme substrate breaking down to irreversible step in many reactions which are known to be reversible in behavior , like the isomerization of glucose to fructose the true reversible enzyme reaction and there are many such examples where the reaction can be catalyzed in either direction.	10.114951727845613
Increasing the substrate concentration leads to more of ess formation.	12.279970603451495
So , we have now.	5.9032160499192265
So , these monomers will polymerize at 25 degree centigrade.	6.001524812741734
There will be small concentrations but they can be neglected.	11.477296926627737
How to make a link between experimental data and the kinetic rate expression that was obtained by these two scientists separately.	11.204893751585344
In practice to derive expression may be quite complex and we are talking only a binary substrate complex formation that might be enzymatic reaction which may involve three substrates and system will be still more complex.	10.04612600954358
So , that this reactions are all most exclusively on the right hand side.	6.41614633656971
Also show the interaction between the three enzyme species that are present.	8.445182647737653
Now , you analyze the end of the reaction , you analyze that that material in the trap and see whether you found any monomers in there.	8.191012556155767
These two are , generally when the polymerization made these two polymers are mixed and ball milled that will mechanically grinded so that , that also increases the surface area of this catalyst.	10.035661126634906
Sample are typically taken in a aluminum container , and then the aluminum container can be covered and creamed , so that nothing goes out , from the container , and parallelly they is a blank container without sample is kept.	12.813103556373347
So , for if you put f here , if you put f here.	8.25277563154513
So , the total flux , of the light coming in.	7.552044370024801
And in case in the ideal solution we had seen that del h mixing is 0 because of the force of like and unlike molecules are 1, 1 2, 2 is equals to 1, 2 and in most often interaction between polymer and a solvent molecule is not athermal.	10.312793061015789
And another way to minimize this sort of size reaction is to use little polar molecular , polar solvent like thf.	10.958424465516204
That means what is the concentration of protein in a given sample and in terms of say milligram per liter.	9.271087927093285
Now in this case in a polymer , there are hardly any differences between , say , first two group or atom in this two case.	10.932756001195816
It is basically a semi - empirical approach as suggested by hildebrand following the principle like dissolves like.	9.295466776122048
What about the second segment.	11.022909964636865
No generalization can be possible.	9.946221462274456
You have the reactivity to be different , the r 1 and r 1 and r 2 values for acrylic acid would be different at different ph.	8.614540334392798
It can attain its own adsorption and they were able to use easily for periods as high as five years.	10.337715219467922
Stir the two solutions inorganic as well as the aqueous phase; agitate it and you get a fine emulsion.	12.187138321929483
You take a bulky anion initiator , so that spherically , this reaction , this substitution reaction becomes problematic.	11.194141981011626
Enzymes here have a very important role to play because of their specificity and many of the analytical situations which are enormously difficult in the case of chemical analysis can be handled very accurately and dependably by use of enzymes and to economize the operation of the analysis , the role of immobilized enzymes becomes more important.	11.051329050915596
So , looking at this material , if you say that , if you make some specimen or some product of the material , this materials will survive till around 100 degree centigrade , but that conclusion will be erratic , if we see this example , these are cd disc made from polycarbonate , and these are made from polyemethylene immaculate.	12.646965157074057
This again , this was deduced for such a way that we are taking out the condensate , in this case h 2 molecules , so that reaction was almost irreversible reaction.	11.483376377074713
S v0 = km ( 1 + h + / k ) + s you will notice that in such a case the net effect of the ionization of substrate is an increase in the km value.	8.487457003446107
And these chain reactions are typically have very high exotherms , and low activation energy , and if you just think little more about the , mechanism of this chain polymerization.	9.509002980473644
You donot want to waste the substrate.	8.792035414151863
So , monomer can approach; the incoming monomer can approach only from a single side and always producing an isotactic polymer.	8.794569911563338
So , this is i , i dot.	6.538879604353073
But what is the role of specificity.	13.174695386693879
So , to improve what is done styrene is copolymerized with acrylonitrle , where the amount of acrylonitrle is limited to 10 to 40 percent by which you can or the solvent resistance property of styrene is improved.	10.863265637900863
Turn over number is unaffected here.	10.87935123640995
Now , we will know whether the polymer , what is the polymers we have made , so in this chemical structure analysis we will be basically discussing , mainly this spectroscopic techniques , by which we will be analyzing the chemical structures including the microstructures of polymer molecules.	10.09125827634615
So , it is a example of a retardation there would be four possible , which is a combination of inhibition and retardation something like this a starts at a sometimes as well as the reaction is slower , this happens if we add 0.2 percent nitro benzene.	9.748888940454554
That means you take the monomers as such which ensures the maximum possible concentration of the monomeric unit.	8.921045165824943
Orientation effect means the aligning of the substrate molecule on the enzyme active site in the right orientation which on collision will result into the product.	9.19154752012678
Here , we i show you a definite examples you have ethyl an hydride here and we have a glycerol , when it reacts in this to reacts it form a linear chain along with a branch coming from this hydroxyl group.	10.283721265686687
This also gives you the feature that the molecular weight of the substrate can also influence the partitioning effect because the maltose being the smallest molecular weight molecule substrate here , it can easily and freely pass through a carrier particle and thereby one can achieve a much higher km value compared to the insoluble one.	11.154304816549473
A combination of halogenated fr and antimony trioxides also used some cases and it is a the way , it is worked that on combustion with the temperature at 600 degree fahrenheit.	13.067440569719567
I have purposely not used the word ambient because you refer it to a well definite range.	9.702703240607155
So in case of polymer solution , the non - ideal behavior of polymer solution or a polymer solution behave unlike a ideal solution of small molecule we juts discussed; because of both the reasons , in most cases , the enthalpy of mixing or enthalpy of solution for a polymer in a solvent is not equal to 0, delta h mixing is not equal to .	8.976324176743317
Because for the higher ph in the bulk the actual ph in the carrier particle will be lower.	10.081205069399598
So , basically under reaction , you get extremely low molecular weight polymers are oligomers and that to the rate of consumption rate of reaction of the monomers happen must lower.	10.683725278310012
We know that if we increase the temperature of a reaction system the frequency of collisions will increase and there by the rate of reaction.	7.7182290548141355
It is almost impossible to align all the chains one after to make a 100 percent or perfect crystalline polymers.	9.173379958602801
So , you first know , how many different types of deformation that a polymer undergo , under applied stress or applied force.	10.351841416492645
So , this keeps the entire distribution; this is the normalized intensity and if you look at the gaps between the molecular ions you can see the gaps is 100 dalton which is exactly the mass for a mma repeating unit.	9.635956414199265
This is the time average , there was no restriction of bond angle; in case actual , you have no 90 degree , you have this 109.5 degree , tetrahedron bond angle , then your actual molecule bond angle would look like this.	9.751765271203453
So , how many functional group now present in the reaction term.	8.995745988236473
So , in this lecture what we have learned.	8.777754921857754
And that is , for amorphous polymer , obviously that should be highest temperature of usage because after that , the polymer becomes so soft that it cannot be useful.	10.758722265751764
So these are the examples how the structure of monomer will determine , whether it can undergo chain polymerization by anionic species , anionic initiator , or a cationic initiator , or radical initiator , and we have seen the examples of several monomers , and let us see the table and we summarize , whatever we are just learned in first last five ten minutes.	9.927008232107344
So , 1 hydrogen give me , this means 1 hydrogen corresponds to 0.2 integration , so if you consider now this alpha ch 3 this is from 3 proton for the nmr it is , now the integration for this 2.545.	11.31206768333378
Now , in this case , we do not know what is the concentration of h 0 h2o.	6.873004107951893
So instead of employing number of analysts they have an auto analyzer in which the immobilized column can carry out the job and almost thousand samples can be analyzed using a single cartage of immobilized enzyme and the cost can be saved effectively.	11.002858635207701
The energy is generated to the required level; materials are stored in case they are not needed.	11.501885292462543
What you have seen , that radical , two radical propagating species can react with each other and can terminate either by combination or by in case of cationic , anionic polymerization or cation polymerization.	9.430434802759093
So , what happens.	3.707761474984944
This reaction , this side is always preferred , unlike not this.	9.216462727563473
So , as the more termination is reaction is going on , the average length of the polymer chains also comes down.	8.433194930846241
That means the polymer and the solvent is soluble across compositions.	7.8974747977209665
This tracer information can be used directly or in conjunction with the flow model to predict the performance of the real flow reactors.	10.224901402628818
I just took few examples.	8.735475832106594
We will consider the case where the two parameters or rather all the three biochemical reaction , external film diffusion and internal pore diffusion are taking place.	7.980348667121532
One more time f 1 is the mole fraction of the pre monomer in the reaction medium , and f 1, capital f of upper case , is the mole fraction of m 1, in the copolymer.	8.588005113754914
So , we stop , and start with the rest of the property in the next lecture.	6.627306124559866
So , you take the monomer you dissolve the initiator and heat the monomer to start the or to initiate the reaction.	7.8953724220455435
So , that is not very practical.	5.476448962892788
And basically what happens.	7.299538411344801
Now , if say 75 percent of this radical has initiated a polymer chain , so efficiency f is 75 percent that means , 6 moles of radical actually initiated polymer chain.	9.191352408359894
And also , we will see later lectures that distribution matters for a given average if distribution changes , then the properties like melt viscosity and the strength , and the mechanical properties also changes with the distribution.	11.445885293706384
So , typically iupac nomenclature is not followed in case of polymer nomenclature.	9.705121891730437
So , this that is the reason that this type of solvent carbon tetra chloride and in specially carbon tetra boride participation the chain transfer reaction very much high extent.	9.207456282097484
In case if you consider a non - porous matrix where all the enzyme is supposed to be on the surface there is no porous network.	9.549601417172578
At this feature e0 is approximately equal to e , the initial enzyme concentration.	8.846824929130022
Now , this reaction complex , the , the activity , the total polymerization rate dependence on this rcl is little complex and we will keep the discussion for this course.	9.411109940386483
That means the enzyme substrate complex which results as a result of these covalent bonds are highly reactive.	8.15134396816735
So , the vapor pressure will lower and we can write if p 1 is the vapor pressure of the solvent in the final temperature; the elevated temperature because of the condensation of the vapor solvent vapor from vapor phase to the solution phase which will be equal at the initial vapor pressure so , that is the equilibrium condition when the condensation stops.	10.017886398180938
The system which is more operationally stable has also some desirable features even at the cost of productivity or fractional conversion all those parameters taken separately.	10.53148524506133
Another feature which i think must be important to note is that an enzyme like any other chemical catalyst does not influence the thermodynamic status of the reaction.	8.190668536483011
India also is a major producer of six apa and produces significant quantity of six apa but bulk of the immobilized enzyme preparations are imported.	12.23691299687401
See , in both the examples , in the last case when we made polyester or in this case we are making polyamides , we have this elimination of this small molecule in this case water.	11.979935478305883
Another method for peptide bond formation which is very commonly employed is by the use of certain condensing reagents , usually the group of reagents defined as rncnr.	11.027181742987116
In most cases the rate of break down of enzyme substrate complex is the reason why many of the enzyme reaction are noted to be very slow in terms of the rate processes.	9.725630966478574
So , free volume of a polymer material depends on molecular weight , presence of plasticizers or plasticizing side group cross linking.	9.910606161697741
This method includes various combination of methods including physical adsorption , ionic binding and metal salt linkage.	7.883915104227173
Similarly at the outlet you also need a pump to withdraw the product stream whereas in the case of batch reactors you just initially charge the reactors and continue under reaction conditions; then discharge the reactor and at the end of it do cleaning operation.	9.989742857303725
The additives must be chosen , keeping in mind the chemical composition of polymer; their additive must be comparable; in the sense , that it should not react with the , with the polymer itself or it should not make harm to the polymer itself , which will deteriorate the polymer property.	10.229679424046706
So , they are like glassy thermosets.	7.694730329355032
We define k in all the terms which we know.	10.130668099238928
It has low crystallinelity; it has t g around 81 degrees centigrade to 80 degree centigrade.	7.960122784932098
You put it on a magnetic stirrer or you can also insert a mechanical stirrer if you want and then you can add the enzyme particles into it and the substrate can be fed to it.	10.984375679360031
Now what is the rate of reaction , or rate at which m 1 is getting incorporated in the copolymer chain.	6.406172989002403
The moisture content in the environment , and that will depend upon rain , condensation , humidity.	11.026599959973534
So the plug flow maximizes or minimizes the product concentration at any given point.	9.036985144430457
Now , if this two propagating radical collide , interact and get terminated of a deformed dead polymer by this propagation reaction , then you get two polymer chain.	8.036770482811155
The third issue and which is also operationally very important is which can be used repeatedly or continuously in a process . ultimate objective of immobilization is to use it either repeatedly in a batch mode so that the same enzyme preparation is used in repeated batches one after another or it can be used in a continuous reactor like a plug flow reactor or a continuous stir tank reactor so that you can process some substrate over a long period of time using a same amount of enzyme and therefore decreasing the cost of enzyme per unit quantity of the product produced.	9.397220914394033
So , there is a still isolated and gibbs free energy mixing , now comes from only the combinatorial entropy , which is basically small for polymer solvent system , but still negative combinatorial combinatorial entropy is positive.	8.808078777665115
Now , out of these two , this radius of gyration is similar to almost like the radius , if you consider the polymer coil as sphere , if you consider coils as a sphere then this radius of gyration is similar to or proportional to the radius of this sphere.	9.902191351222008
Now , let us we start a reaction at t is equal to 0, i have a say 1000 mole of 1000 moles of monomer m and say 10 moles of i , initiator molecules.	8.064878596011644
Similarly an activator molecule will increase the reaction rate and that is a very common feature of the regulation of enzyme activity and which is of significance even for commercial applications.	10.475929402289287
So , they have z minus 2 contact.	8.204341219893458
This provides you one of the simple methods.	13.582281852251667
Recovery of product means you need to disrupt the micelle , reform the micelle so the reaction cannot be really carried out in a continuous mode and that causes severe problem , operational problem.	11.755970406883975
This is a process flow diagram that is still in operation in japan and has been in operation since 1963, the first system which came into being and is still being operated.	10.12340794271199
Then obviously the react monomer reactivity ratios will differ , will dramatically different , which depends on the stabilization of the resulting active center.	9.800548720400343
After a very short interval of time when the reaction starts , concentration of enzyme and the enzyme substrate complex reaches a constant value and if you look at the time scale for the enzyme catalyzed reaction , this is concentration axis.	11.673545892323771
So , what we reach is not a true equilibrium; it is a steady state.	8.987706937502118
Whenever we look into any method particularly the protein engineering methods we tend to increase the number of sulphydryl bridges.	12.698545013548095
In most cases the enzymatic catalytic function is both substrates specific as well as product specific.	9.12804104982302
So , it is basically the entropy , the delay value is basically the entropy of change in , entropy of the translational , entropy of the monomers resulting in a polymer.	8.082240015871472
So , what is the property of two a group.	6.612209787816666
They are not in kilograms like other molecules.	8.243704169285845
One , experimental observation.	11.55012693898979
Now , these fellow r 1 and r 2, they are almost independent of the reaction medium , or reaction conditions for radical polymerization , but the values of r 1 and r 2 could be quite different , when you talk about different initiation system , and we will talk about giving a specific example in few minutes.	7.935516853656059
So , it is not always possible to increase the monomer concentration.	5.634826929163158
Now this intensity of the scattered light can be fluctuating with very short time; the time scale is very short like micro seconds to milliseconds.	9.85184200350223
Coming back to the specificity the presence of ligand binding sites on the enzyme molecule are responsible for specificity.	10.082685895320509
And , we can , for example , we can classify them as a protective , protective additives; which , they are the additives which prevent , or delay , or in or influence , the ageing process or degradation process in the polymers.	10.005371529103448
In case of elastomer , the polymers are you know having conformation , quailed type conformation in in normal case.	9.573147650020214
Here you must appreciate that when we talk of equilibrium of enzyme substrate complex with enzyme and substrate molecules it means that the break down of enzyme substrate complex into product is a very , very slow process and it does not disturb the equilibrium process of the enzyme substrate binding.	8.928200352437498
Polymer chains are getting formed; it is not the molecular weight increases.	14.561408822791929
If you introduce a flexible group in between , then t m goes down.	6.880879957200264
So , basically if you are talking about two , three polymers , they can form like different crystalline states.	8.00719324152991
The constant which briggs and haldane proposed was not developed by michaelis and menten.	11.768898600824533
Now total number molecule is n 0 which is n 1 plus n .	9.803528625621455
In the last lecture we had studied the mechanism , the strategies by which we can control the molecular weight of a step polymer.	6.186019938117016
Now , we can always argue that with the increase in the size; most likely when there was interaction between the chains , also increases which causes increase in intermolecular forces.	9.680282478679858
The k can be used as a first order rate constant for design of the immobilized enzyme continuous reactor.	9.176213162622432
Before we move on to other methods of determining polymer molecular weight and namely weight average molecular weight , just to emphasize one point that we know the m n is very much sensitive to the low molecular weight species present at the impurities in a polymer sample.	10.826185315292689
Therefore the hydrogen ion concentration inside the carrier will be greater than the bulk.	8.065949206820555
What are the other types it can undergo.	11.235625894412971
So , you can use the emulsion as such.	5.594502900590128
Second major of the main contribution in deter or determining factor in t g is the , freedom of the polymer chain to rotate around its single bond , which gives us the mobility of the polymer chain.	9.974807675150617
In case of chain polymerization you had situation like this where you can achieve the high molecular weight at the beginning and the time goes or the more or monomer get converted , monomer get reacted you get the amount of high molecular weight polymers more and more with time.	10.064781788098337
For example if you consider the enzyme and the three factors the cost , reuse and stability then the immobilized enzyme systems are very , very suitable for high cost enzymes; the cost of the enzyme is very high.	8.74625722563074
It does not depend whether the polymer structure is a linear structure; for example , for gel permeation chromatography , we typically use the principles and postulates of the gaussian flexible polymer chain , but in this case we do not need any polymers having any shapes or any structures can be determined; and the maldi tof very efficiently for low molecular regions very gpc does not work , and other information besides molecular weight averages and the poly disperisty index , the repeat unit mass , the end group mass this are also can be received.	10.266498366382935
So , as soon as the reaction start , within a very short period of time , the rate of initiation becomes same as rate of termination; as a result , the concentration of these total radical species , rate radical propagating radical become constant at during the entire polymerization reaction; and that is not very unusual , because we , when we do the kinetics of the first reactions with having intermediates , then we always assume steady state , and we do the kinetics in that way.	9.890836316666594
So , we found , that even for the reactions where transfer reaction is absent , if we decrease temperature the molecular weight goes up.	8.63598653313898
The probability of finding a chain which has x structural unit which is nothing but the mole fraction , mole on number fraction of x mar which is say , n x 1 by p p to the power x minus .	8.53133633752321
Both the products find application in the food or related industry.	9.87151805134806
So , if it burns , and the while burning the sparks comes and ignite the cotton , which basically gives lower rating.	9.751751356407672
Here there is a cis arrangement and for this double bond also you have a cis arrangement.	13.624039384743822
In case of anionic polymers it is little complicated and it is not very generic way.	8.903253769514496
So , now we have this vacant orbital.	6.931645606302305
When we name glucose oxidase we interpret that glucose is a substrate with oxygen as the ultimate lactone acceptor for oxidation of glucose.	9.050278880096618
So , we typically use this term high temperature gpc for that; and very high molecular weight polymers typically more than 6; dalton they are sometimes 6 gram per mole type polymers might get the inside the column , because generation of high shear.	9.329192667015468
Distribution c / c0, you will get a different kind of a profile from which the parameters f1and f2 can be calculated.	11.850239408441011
X - axis is lns0 / s.	10.588299330532465
So basically , only what is the change here.	11.875804572835335
Very often just by a ph profile if the number of amino acid residues involved are not very large , one can guess the likely number of amino acid residues involved and knowing the pk value of different amino acids that are known , that are likely to be present one can make judgment whether a particular ionisable amino acid residues present or not.	9.293300686312257
So , that is your molecular weight distribution.	5.871166995767623
Yield is a very important parameter.	12.768902342111005
There are arrangements for temperature , ph and flow rate control.	8.993493620232819
So , the unsaturation and the tarcaric chlorines are very bad for thermal stability , for polyvinyl fluoride.	9.163348594309554
Now as we know that this expression the flory - huggins expression , this is from flory - huggins theory , flory - huggins theory is not applicable for dilute solutions; we can write this expression as instead of this we can write this expression like earlier cases , we can write this as a variant expression.	9.538898582135186
In this case number of repeat units is actually half of the number of structural units.	7.155565526843192
It was one of the earliest methods also because the poly acrylamide gel preparation was an existing methodology even for gel electrophoresis.	10.433303452667744
No . bulk here is organic solvent and here it was water.	10.078293972252608
In this case , exactly is 98 percent , but for all purpose , we can consider p is 1 and pdi is close to 2 and md is close to 2000.	11.056371146309045
So to improve of this property of polystyrene , you can actually make a copolymer of polystyrene acrylonitrile , and this actually improves the chemical resistance property of , chemical resistance of over styrene homopolymers.	11.200093738519731
This is example of h 2 i x spectra for this particular polymer , and this is like this is a particular bond for nh 3, nh stretching , this is for ch stretching and so on.	10.06212580603791
Like ph , temperature is also a multidimensional parameter which influences different aspects of the enzyme catalyzed reaction.	8.806465352880803
It can react with say , this case the benzoyl peroxide is initiator and it can check up this and from now , this can again react with the monomer and initiate another kinetic chain.	8.96095982866019
This has to be taken care while preparing the immobilized enzyme preparation so that the km value does not increase because otherwise it will lead to a less sufficient catalysis.	10.493021513094819
Number average molecular weight.	5.960197055060535
So , this is the way calibration is done for a gpc; several mono dispersed polymer sample with known molecular weight are injected in the column and their elution volumes are plotted against log of molecular weight , and such as linear plot is constructed.	8.566790160049512
So , part of which are lost.	8.149492829939664
Now , the associated enthalpy chains will give you del h 0 and the entropy change will give you the del s 0 of the polymer.	8.643094731998247
The role of irreversible inhibitors can be expressed as ki kin e + i ei einac k - i the first step shows a reversible process but the process doesn t stop here.	9.799955401890687
Then from here eab has to go to transition state eab * as i showed in the earlier comparative figure and this eab * is much , much smaller than the energy level of ab * for uncatalyzed reaction.	9.07832634623223
So , that the vaporization be taken place and it should give rapid vaporization.	9.253784446762278
And you find out the intrinsic viscosity for this given polymer and then by plotting log intrinsic viscosity versus log molecular weight , you can get k and a value; from that you can get this m v.	11.24646438541936
So , if you compare , you want to compare between materials , you can compare with the amount of deformation , same amount to deformation between the materials.	9.141192241623163
The arrangement of these polypeptide chains into a particular formation can result in certain interaction which can form catalytic sites.	8.66185731411984
It is very similar in confirmation and very often enzyme active site mistakes it for succinic acid and therefore it acts as a competitive inhibitor in the same reaction.	10.7492068097575
Let us take example of photodegradation of one polymer.	6.444745300225807
So if you increase further , your t m further goes down.	7.155491690698441
During use , the whole matrix is under certain hydrodynamic condition and which might cause the degradation of the carrier.	9.956981700897526
The fourth mechanism which represents the binary complex formation is ping - pong mechanism.	9.19715285974376
Now , you can synthesize telechelic polymers by taking an initiator , which is already functional group.	8.833375273395683
So , we want to extrapolate at 0 angle at 0 angle t theta will be 1; so , you can eliminate any intermolecular scattering effect and at c is equal to 0, we can eliminate the intermolecular scattering effect all together.	8.916291231759295
A large number of examples which you may be familiar with are what we call as group specific enzymes.	6.964138759446293
Very often if colloidal substrates are to be used a plug flow reactors faces problem in terms of plugging or choking of the column.	11.730321973716192
Consider a stirred reactor of constant volume v where the substrate is put , the product stream is coming out and the step input is added here at a concentration c0 and the flow velocity is q.	10.58041047930461
There has been lot of studies and lot of mechanism proposed during last several decades.	10.94922181964497
You will notice that you have k - 1 and k.	9.400071605848142
In this case , these polymers cannot react with each other just by itself.	7.287160516977686
The other mechanism by which the enthalpic factors contribute to reducing energy of activation is general acid base catalysis.	9.63508150661066
So , the pdi goes beyond .	8.504711563278835
We understand that we require a particular reaction to be catalyzed.	11.037951842103274
So , you expect that activation energy for the initiation reaction should be higher than the other two.	7.495151901355867
The two cysteine molecules can undergo oxidation to give you cystine molecule which acts as bridges and these bridges is very strong contributor to the stability of the protein molecule in its tertiary structure.	9.513190437142528
As far as the applications are concerned a lot of engineering inputs are required particularly for the extended use of the catalyst and we don t want to use it just once.	10.095995686217943
The three cases are typical examples of three extreme situations of the inhibitor binding.	9.679311760586758
If we write for e there should be three different possibilities.	10.378418055555459
So , by this time , we now know the different types of , different types of initiation possibilities; that means , different types of molecules which can be used as initiator to generate radical in the reaction medium and not only the molecule , but the ways they can produce radical; for example , by thermal , by photo , or by electro chemical , we just talked about , or the radical can be generated by a very high energy radiations like gamma ray or x ray.	10.172816641535569
Now let us start with ideal solutions of small molecules.	5.816255650058582
By meaning that they participate directly in the catalysis i mean that they are present at the active site.	9.573309143244256
First of all , we have seen , that presence of this small molecular cyclics will increase the polydispersity index , which means , the distribution of the polymers chains and which effect property in , in several cases , not coming to specific examples , but it , it , it does effect the polymer property in , in several cases.	10.287606314342085
So , light stabilizer must; basically we talked about 2 types of light stabilizer - one , which can absorb the uv light and protect the bulk of the polymer from uv light; and second we talked about hals , which basically prevent the oxidation process or the radical process , and prevent the molecular weight degradation.	11.40065212169702
Now , at some point of time , some point temperature , rate of depropagation also , this is dp and this is p , is a propagation and this is depropagation also increases.	11.691768187395198
In this case also as the thiele modulus or the beta value increases the reaction shifts from zero order to first order.	7.653539036226872
In this case chain case , we do not consider the monomers , whether in the step polymers case , we consider every molecule present at the end of the reaction.	7.42657138319403
That means s0 is something like about five km values.	8.612233605533541
Usually these products , this product is less than .	10.6548496747521
But the interfaces are somehow , compatibilized using compatibiliser like block copolymers made up of two different homopolymers.	10.293420384854336
Next , we know , that to make a high molecular weight , p should be close to 1, the conversion , the conversion and from kinetics discussion we have seen , that to have p close to 1, very high number , we have to continue the reaction for a longer time.	8.736820478594954
And we found that in most cases it will increase the temperature , the polymerization rate goes up and thermal molecular weight also comes down , except the case of growth of polymerization.	8.943640315723307
Here i must again put a caution.	12.464631347815045
So , it cannot crystallize.	7.039125983196962
Some commercial phosphite anti oxidants are shown here.	8.09927096780657
You need to plot log m v; that is what you need to determine.	10.400549008297277
The average remains same which is same as 25 years as earlier.	9.823151250133819
Such a mechanism very effectively can explain the high degree of the specificity for the enzyme molecule.	9.171951071369241
Obviously this alpha methyl styrene have a much lower del h value.	9.205938013139818
All the defects or all the limitations of an ultra filtration system will also be associated here.	9.22966062274271
It can have both the directions and the reaction can be carried out high pressure and the reactor contains the polymer bound co - enzyme , the substrate and the two enzymes.	9.236622983791166
So , for aqua solvent we can use bsa which is aqua solvent typically have 2 nanometer dimension radius is 2 nanometer; so , this is also again an isotropic scatterer.	9.904982085721002
It has been felt that for many applications their isolation and purification is not required.	9.381155614890119
So , i write , substitute e for these all this concentration.	7.010995766543214
Now , if the double bond for the two monomer has different electrostatic charge , if they are then they are what will happen r 1 and r 2 would be close to .	9.106547132846796
For example , if you compare one butane and two butane , it is easier to polymerize one butane than two butane.	9.195814115728776
They may call random copolymers.	7.933070108166764
Say for example you are putting one gram of some inert dye into the reactor initially and after that you monitor its output response.	10.570886565569127
And , the growing polymer chain is always attached to the transition metal.	8.4945882344823
You can get it from the values of del 0 p and del s p.	6.730758462075183
Proteases for peptide synthesis , oxidases for variety of reactions for example cholesterol to cholestenone , butanol to butanaldehyde , p - phenylphenol to phenol - formaldehyde resins , p - cresol to o - quinone and ethanol to hydrogen peroxide.	10.942422756107682
It will be vm when the value of b is saturating.	9.171994488007053
If you look at the cavity of cyclodextrin it is almost like a paper and cylinder and on the surface they attach a number of functional groups , the same functional groups which are known to be possessed by and this is for example chymotrypsin analogue.	9.191297811678213
It can act as a batch immobilized enzyme reactor where with the total recycle packed bag , the total recycle mode.	10.1621825406525
Am is the area of the mass transfer which is described as area cm2 / cm3; that means the surface area per unit volume of the particle.	11.104030506217677
And , these degradation is accelerated by , in presence of light , heat , oxygen and presence of acids.	8.111936973651035
It will change , and then go back , and then of the strain will apply , the time when you apply the stress.	10.776927104210483
In the case of immobilized enzyme that problem is not there because the enzyme is already separated and the product stream as it is can be used as a food constituent directly in the product form.	8.969322061577467
L is greater than two when diffusional control was established , the energy of activation noted was.	9.7297014669767
So , we move to the next topic.	6.271511067831506
So , how this different set of values of r 1 r 2, how that would be changing the combination of our copolymer composition with conversion.	8.769163568565506
So , the polymer chain will become like a glass.	7.819549669341244
The implications of this assumption are the fact that when we monitor the reaction rates we can safely assume that s0 is approximately equal to s.	10.258704736401256
So , the p d i value will be between this is 1.5 to the case where we have termination by this propagation of transfer this .	8.868575771923492
In such a case also as a system we will call as an immobilized enzyme system although the preparation will no longer be immobilized in the physical form , in the form of like what we considered as the bound preparation or entrapped preparation but still functional because in such a system you can use the enzyme continuously or repeatedly without loosing in the product stream.	9.794096548296093
Experimentally the magnitude of ka , kb , k a and vm can be determined by double reciprocal plot analysis.	10.610717779604704
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in today s lecture , which is lecture number seventeen , i am going to cover or begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization.	5.083884347290933
So , what happens.	3.707761474984944
So , basically , we can use this sort of , we can use uv visible spectroscopy for this sort of use in polymer science.	8.326825414724151
Finally from academic point of view i think the enzyme kinetics has also played a very important role in classification of the enzymes particularly when the same enzyme is obtained from different sources their kinetic characterization gives you a very good tool to distinguish between them and use them so that you can understand and identify the enzyme based on the kinetic characteristics.	11.417361096471756
So the rate of deactivation also along the length of the reactor is different and therefore a simple analytical solution is difficult.	8.189195518556637
To certain discrepancies in the immobilization procedure.	13.121871020265823
Remember this is the p 1 is to present the vapor pressure of the solvent in polymer solution if this elevated temperature whereas p 1 0 is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent at the original temperature.	9.592413754152481
Now , if is , it is up to you , whether you want to write 2, or if you do not want to write 2; but , if you write 2 here , then similarly when in initiation reaction a homiletic cleavage gives up 2 radicals , you have to write 2 as well.	10.14191884921261
Apparently hydrolysis may be unimolecular reactions but it is not so.	12.70644807568711
So , if you want to have , you want to make some polymeric material , which does not , or should not have any scattering , then your material must be very homogenous in respect to the refractive index value , across the inter medium.	9.037712553899896
In fact their application in process industry was adopted much later than they were used in analytical applications and that means the cost implications are much more severe in analytical sections.	10.700687424977545
So you have to make arrangement for dissipation of heat so that the temperature can be maintained at less than ten degree centigrade and the enzyme is not deactivated.	10.177538968311257
We do not have any charm which is related to the polymer radicals , these are all the terms are related to the monomer.	9.1608221081951
This means that a fraction of the total enzyme available in the immobilize preparation is not able to interact with the substrate because of diffusion limitations.	8.573414002008768
We have either monomer , or high molecular polymers , and also have you know , this initiator molecules , and solvent if we required this chain.	9.364895471281534
That is the order which it goes and it is a fairly large range.	10.085640143896251
The whole set of information about the synthesis of a protein is coded in the dna molecule.	9.831586584909942
So , that means , it has already reached the equilibrium , then it will be never polymerized further.	8.959213782292949
That means it is involved in the transfer of a phosphoryl group from atp to a given range of substrate.	8.29745010203869
So , polystyrenes have also some high end applications.	8.435333269576791
So , what we will do in the next lecture , let us start from this page and look at the value of this c s transfer constant and is know , the higher the value of c s , the more the solvent participate in the transfer reaction so lower would be the molecular weight of the resulting polymer.	8.178496334291866
The amino group on the aromatic ring is identical in both the molecules.	9.74804582835946
Now , you also know from basic physical chemistry knowledge , that rate constant can be expressed in form of arrhenius - type equation expression where you can write rate constant is a e to the power minus e by rt , where k is rate constant , a is the frequency factor , frequency collation factor , e is the activation energy for the reaction.	9.14603500657948
And you know for large n , large value of n i stirling s approximation gives you ln n factorial; this is from your previous mathematical knowledge.	9.722265241199782
What , till now what has happtill this twenty four lectures was except the first few couple of lectures , where we give introduction about polymers.	10.5350379849631
While considering the various ways we will consider the lowering of energy of activation through each of the contributions and first we will see lowering of energy of activation through entropic contributions.	10.713145827736424
We always tend to compare a rate of expression with that of michaelis menten rate expression.	10.023029205810047
So , rate of polymerization , r p , is given by k p , concentration of and the monomer.	6.843080348904161
So , the p d i you got one plus p which is for the entire polymer which includes small molecules as well as the high molecular weights.	8.36324137137192
E + s es e + p + + i i ei + s esi the enzyme can also bind to inhibitor giving ei and because the binding site of the substrate is different , ei can again bind to form esi and the es can also bind to i to give esi.	9.0147427363022
So what are the four possible propagation reactions possible in , during this copolymerization , lets around right those.	10.41898619620832
Now , this gives you the reaction with , the ratio , or the relative reaction of m 2 dot m 2 star , with m 1, m 2 and m 1, and this keeps m .	9.318355699906151
So , though this is a chain polymerization , but the reaction rate or the propagation rate constant is having much lower value compared to several order of magnitude growth in comparison to normal chain polymerization.	9.909056662056722
This is a calibration curve which you are getting by doing experiments of intrinsic viscosity measurement of many polymer molecular of known molecular weight.	9.258364855311072
Now , here it can have two special arrangements , one it can have like ch 3, and so in this case we as we discussed in terms of copolymerization.	10.35969210668276
So now , you have seen , how this polymers are converted to the articles now , we will discuss about the properties of this final polymer and this properties are very essential for the applications.	10.011371011459147
But , obviously , you can now understand that , because you added two 40 years professors , the ability to the knowledge or ability to score in exam is much more for this sample compared to the earlier one.	10.36304446916549
So , basically we started with a vpo vapor pressure osmometry.	7.078302094549867
So , if you compare this and this , i can write , the average degree of polymerization is given by 1 by 1 minus p.	5.419556115457223
And as we can see that for a given concentration of solution if we increase the molecular weight , the number of molecules goes down.	6.801636347501682
So , before entanglement , the viscosity scales to the , with the power of one , with molecular weight , whereas the slope changes to about 3.4, after the entanglement molecular weight.	9.75444308114274
A substrate molecule with a central carbon atom and a , b and c functional groups is present on this substrate molecule.	9.212662918302444
So , that we can get a curve like this and we can get m n , m w and the other m z and so on from this curve.	8.894028874495802
Now , while vaporization the molecules may also get , because it is a high temperature to process the molecules can get degraded also.	9.46758348112039
In another case if you look at the combined cstr and ultra filtration reactor which is one of the model system which has been used for substrate which are solid in nature and where enzyme is required to be used in soluble form one can carry out the reaction in stirred reactor , in a cstr , with the possibility of the product stream passing through a ultra filtration chamber where by the enzyme is the recycled back and the product is withdrawn from the permeate stream.	10.257796401664105
The other polymers or other molecules present as contaminant will not contribute to error in the case of a biuret method.	9.479775981270686
They made physical measurements experimentally of the thiele modulus and also calculated the effectiveness factor based on these expressions and they gave for both sphere as well as discs of different thicknesses and confirmed the validity of the first order reaction rate expression applicable in many cases of packed bed reactors.	11.01371025999793
In the recent years an added dimension is molecular biology where we tend to understand the structure function relationship of various biological molecules at a molecular level.	9.042735534605317
Such reactions are normally likely to occur more efficiently in the hydrophobic active sites on the enzyme surface as it can shield them from the aqueous phase.	9.397602944254631
We will also discuss the kinetics and energetics of cationic chain polymerization and then move to anionic chain polymerization talk about the features of anionic polymerization , and then like the cationic chain polymerization talk about different ways of initiation and propagation and termination reactions.	9.818025158307293
Now these are the delta g m , delta g , delta g m and delta s are the corresponding terms for particular , per unit for per.	11.702187448026782
So , there is a loose cyclic intermediate formation and one side is blocked by lithium.	8.129247890894023
Therefore the two hypotheses provide you a very similar inference as far as the kinetic function of enzymes are concerned.	8.957509401833848
Now , look at these values of the groups as i said that this is this gives this , basically the solubility parameter is basically the square root of the cohesive energy density.	9.26141185172085
The transition state compound will ultimately break down to give you the product or in other word the energy of activation acts a barrier.	12.022953291536108
Now , we will talk about the third option possible , where r 1 multiplied by r 2 is neither 0 nor neither .	7.754711671194142
Now , which end will take.	8.870018000253426
Next , talk about the effect of plasticizing side groups.	10.253508722746398
Here x - axis is operational time and y - axis is fraction of conversion.	10.162127062368446
That means the enzyme reaction rate will not be proportional to the enzyme concentration in the particle but will be proportional to the square root of the enzyme concentration in the particle.	7.415227615540736
Obviously , this because of the presence of crystallites , catalyte and invariably we get translucent to opaque material.	10.212970519042274
On the other hand the response of a delta input is called c curve.	6.4136830269858205
So , in general , if you want to summarize , flexible back bone , lower modulus and strength , chain stiffness would have back bone or bulky side group increases the modulus and strength , and chain stiffness lower the impact strength and elongation would break.	8.467007940232262
Then ph is another feature.	8.979784146467601
At low substrate concentrations the enzyme reaction rate is proportional to substrate concentration.	8.679910019235468
A situation something like that of micelle in which the substrate can be shielded from the bulk aqueous phase and still the hydrophobic environment can be provided to the substrate.	9.927655734164242
So , this is , this is very important part.	5.9512379307136225
The ultimate matrix must be insoluble in water and also it should be in a proper range of cross linking such that the porosity can be regulated.	12.132495296618949
E - kt . edt and sum it over , you will get the concentration of the substrate remaining unreacted in the exit stream as a function of flow behavior and reaction kinetics.	8.368731524825035
I will not go into detailed analysis of those because they will only have very long expressions.	9.089304637538232
I don t think it will be very difficult task to do that.	10.161617233685668
Now in such cases the applicability of michaelis menten equation is still valid under conditions that one of the substrate is held at a constant concentration which is in excess and one substrate which is limiting.	10.046284250825858
N 0 was number of molecules in the beginning and n is the number of molecules now.	10.363342509826305
We call that chain as a kinetic chain , kinetic chain have 100 monomers.	9.465189859573757
We will continue our discussion on step - growth polymerization which we were having in last lecture.	6.2302910474266895
That means the cost of the enzyme per unit product is significantly reduced by the reusability.	8.959159896238702
So , it is not that all the pores are having same size , the pores size also have some distribution.	7.643344821293849
That means this reaction this monomer cannot or this chain cannot take further reactions which will allow you to control the molecular rate.	9.014598222679396
For this reaction , m n dot we are writing m dot and copper 2 plus.	10.120659344877543
There might be coupled partitioning effects as i have shown in the lower figures in the gradient lower but basically these are the three major issues : biochemical reaction , external film diffusion and internal pore diffusion that are encountered in the case of an immobilized enzyme reactor which need to be considered while we consider the reactor performance.	8.47333322427031
Now , let us , you , you follow all the , let us , you follow all the , all this , everything , all this points , which we covered in , in last 5, 10 minutes , you , you follow exactly all the things according to my direction or according to direction given in a book and end of the reaction , you find , that there is no molecular builder , it just forms oligomer.	9.222004649210225
So , let us talk about example of methyl methacrylate.	4.480867957245526
On the other hand when the.	4.690164092429566
The three dimensional confirmation of the active site takes care of that.	9.50221079967955
That means the parameter which we should define initially before we go on to design any particular reactor was tau , the space time in the reactor; initial substrate concentration , enzyme loading , e.	10.756606211532171
If i have , say like , a a plus b f type , it can undergo cross - linking , you can visualize , yourself plus a f plus few b b molecule , then also it can cross link , from cross link , or you can have , if you have a f plus b f molecule , this , all this can form cross - links , cross linking.	10.80751709308573
A 10 % error in calculation is usually taken for granted.	11.956620474375244
They can exist in different state of aggregation and that state , that state of aggregation will be , will definitely determine the reactivity of the anionic groups at the same end.	9.419192520213652
You get a diazonium derivative of the solid support by treating the support containing aromatic amino groups with sodium nitrite.	10.339587575669395
So , see intensity of the scattered light actually becomes also proportional in addition to it become depend up on the molar mass , concentration and d n by d c square , it also depends up on the p theta which we call the form factor or angular scattering factor.	9.20710572628471
If r 1 is 1, then both are equal; that means there is no preference were homo propagation and copolymerization , so it completely random copolymer is formed , and if r is less than 1 then the tendency to the co - polymerise , is more than the tendency to homopolymerized.	11.700562826350925
Considering the active site it is a combination of two functional entities : one is the binding site , substrate binding site plus the catalytic site.	11.325182469232585
Another class of method is co - polymerization of an enzyme with the reactive monomers.	11.154393834886696
Distribution for any given fluid element from a reactor then your zero to infinity edt is equal to one.	10.358225364523912
Now , what happened if initiator forms radical , initiator is forming radical , now this radical will react with the monomer present in the aqueous medium and form.	8.526346421318491
The other report is by gilbault and kramer in 6.	11.81231490049148
The michaelis menten kinetics should be applied to a limiting substrate and the other substrate must be in excess and therefore its concentration can be considered to be constant.	11.60656796566408
Now , the this the solubility of the monomer or the partition of the monomer outside micelle , and in the aqueous medium would depend on the solubility of the monomer in aqueous solution.	9.494658534260044
If you do in a non - polar medium and with a small counter ion , now we know in or from our knowledge about anionic polymerization that there is the anionic chain and the count; there will always be the counter ion , say , m plus.	9.647477847509473
It is a three dimensional structure on the surface of the enzyme molecule and not that all the amino acids on these active sites are located in proximity in the amino acid chain.	9.589226757510678
This is just for your knowledge.	6.275309319039612
And , not only this is true for mono functional agent , this reaction can be shown through , if you have the another coh in the other side.	9.921675259833902
Then obviously , in any given opportunity , the polymer will try to release that stress , and one opportunity of its come contact with the chemical , it might release that stress , by cracking or crazing and so on.	9.306203264809797
We can take , we talked about this example of benzyl peroxide and diethyl amine in the last class.	8.301168814459098
Now , what happened.	3.408171685038454
So , for very large size polymer chains which has a larger size does not penetrate in the pore size.	8.945491149809055
For example m 1 is more reactive compare to the m 2, then in the propagating copolymer chain m 1 will get incorporated , faster rate , in faster rate than in two polymers.	9.724607512518416
Having both positive and negative group at the end will ensure that at any given ph the molecule will have some charge.	11.06855688945587
In most practical cases , these are taken out by applying vacuum; and also increasing temperature , by increasing temperature; and doing that , you force the equilibrium move towards right hand side , which will gives you the polymer.	9.927448522921097
If you look at secondary structure in the form of a right handed alpha helix , the helix moves upwards and basically their structure results from the formation of hydrogen bonding between the peptide bonds.	8.358729835344949
One of the reasons we considered was that the molecules have to posses a certain minimum energy , potential energy so as to reach to the level of energy of activation before they can break down into product from the unstable state.	9.560206663959704
Total number of functional group reacted divided by total number of functional group present.	6.813914685144997
In case of , suspension monomer and monomer soluble water suspension polymers are nothing but bulk polymerization done in in small volumes.	9.349772705501508
So , for ionic reaction monomer also participate in the chain initiation reaction where in case of radical monomer was not actually part of the chain initiating expression now , the reaction rate also depend , depends on this yz , which is basically a cocatalyst.	10.910447426903861
Now , let us talk about kinetics of radical polymerization.	4.038872839922504
Look at some of the phrases which i mentioned; cross linked water insoluble polymeric gels.	10.243919105494953
At t e represents at equilibrium.	8.469121960371808
At least part of the surface , part of the additives must have a low surface energy component , it must be thermally stable.	11.249296974276568
So , at some temperature , some temperature t , which we call t c , ceiling temperature , ceiling temperature , this r p becomes r dp.	8.793407811105752
Write all the possible pathways which are feasible to form and this is for e.	13.07179648169313
That means polymer will the solution or the mixture of polymer and the solvent will be favored , if this is positive then it will be higher than the value of ideal.	10.312945209425918
It can also exist as the chloro complex; five chloride ions and one water molecules.	8.346791646355841
What is the radical.	10.579441429337765
Ke * = k *.	12.401715796466029
The reason for this monomers are the solvents to participate in chain transfer reaction is because of there stability of stabilization of the resulting irons.	10.492260381354711
So , for further stretching of the chains become difficult , polymer chains becomes difficult so , if you have more stress to give a given strain and this has strain hardening this is because , strain called strain hardening and this slopes sometimes can get give us the strain hardening modulus.	9.756023456362856
So , we can utilize this by making block co - polymers by design of the second monomer at the end of the reaction and also , we talked about the different polymerization process like bulk suspension , emulsion , dispersion solution , different types of processes and the advantages and disadvantages of all these processes and at the beginning of your requirement , you should choose the polymerization process which suit you the most and at the end , we discussed few examples of the commercial polymers which is synthesized using this radical chain polymerization technique.	9.431914341819505
It may ultimately depend upon the chemical composition of the carrier.	9.149306046035116
Now , then they have they do not time , because there is already one segment is present , it will not allow , it will exclude the portion from the other chain to come and occupy the same space , where this will exclude any volume from the other segments.	11.049209984262374
Some people , or some students in , from our experience , you have seen that they confused this with the repeat unit; then they were confused that this is a molecular repeat unit , this is molecular rate of the structure unit.	11.567762141353676
In the case of pfr the situation will be much more complex because the concentration of substrate across the reactor is not constant.	7.850221996599518
I am breaking into two terms.	9.463302244726872
This is styrene and when it polymerized its gives you polystyrene.	9.524949940739733
You can carry out the polymerization till the free monomer concentration reaches the equilibrium value of the temperature and because these numbers are low , 10 to power minus 9, 10 to power minus 6 and minus 3, which is considered , say , 25 five degree centigrade.	8.897671249903265
Gel formation means , which is not soluble in the medium , which is insoluble in any solvent , all in bulk as well.	11.741639978468756
So , the configuration of this carbon is determined by the configuration of the penultimate carbon with this case , this carbon.	8.289475266086486
It will go and move to the next topic of ziegler - natta polymerization or coordination polymerization.	7.098468325416847
The slope of this straight line will be , at low substrate concentration , 1 / klam + km / k2e.	10.674081024381533
It is basically gives the rate of the polymerization times verses conversion gives you rate of polymerization.	8.3685682975964
And as i said earlier , this four is your , the termination reactions.	7.049212648588561
F 1 versus f 1 curve will cross; f 1 is equal to f 1 curve line rather at one point , which corresponds to azeotropic mole fraction f 1 azo.	11.20221588419841
So , we need all these molecular weights as well as the distribution p d index , m w by m n , to completely under the sample; what you mean by understand , the properties of the sample.	8.13668505011863
But on the other hand when the immobilized enzyme preparation is controlled by diffusion , that relationship does not hold good.	8.440480498355742
I will give examples which will clarify these points more in , once the final application is done the , this life cycle of the polymers does not end.	10.122205587399415
Two dead polymer chain , which will have again the same number of monomer molecules , which were present in the chain before the termination reactions.	11.05860349965259
Hence the inter molecular attraction goes down , hence t m goes down , so 260 degree.	9.800674786505844
So , this gives you 26.	9.059745940453851
It is k ln w p or s m by k ln w p will be given by minus n 1 ln.	9.648050050644102
It will stop the molecule there itself.	7.243704866694958
So , let us start our discussion on optical properties; now when you make a material out of the polymer , like plastic material.	7.852286552191784
So , that is one validation for data point and from the two straight lines one is c is equal to 0 straight line , another one is theta is equals to 0 straight lines.	8.821032166326141
So , we start to get contribution from the a 3 term or c squared term.	8.46098137793842
So , we have found the number of distinguishable ways; all the n 2 number of polymer molecules can be placed , w p would be because each.	9.423565647418686
Now , this can undergo a hydride shift and from this carbo cation.	7.727433840822289
Now , del s and del g .	9.294794142730124
Solving these equations you can also get k 2e.	18.519092679747473
So , how , you must know , how you will handle the additives which you are going to add in the formulation , and how you are going to mix it with the plastics , that is important.	9.669711746695576
So thermister is nothing else but a semiconductor material which is connected to a circuit which measures impedance and if that is put at the tip of the effluent stream of the immobilized enzyme reaction you can use it for measurement of temperature.	9.552123433512309
I must say that this is not the comprehensive list of the type of the reactors that has been reported.	10.567222401753169
There is very tricky situation; in many cases people have also reported effectiveness factor exceeding unity; experimental observations.	10.91033249890669
Only difference is that in this case , r is defined as n a plus n b plus 2 n b dash.	9.41427674459005
Now let us talk about the tacticity.	6.169554538671269
In that case , we call that system as a semi - interpenetrating network , where one of the constituents is linear chain polymer and another one is network polymers.	8.488936102154225
And if you compare between difference material and out of same sample specimen then , higher the modulus obviously , higher will be the stiffness , higher will be the resistance to bend.	9.73232052361195
So , if q goes up the reactivity will go up and e goes down the value of e goes down because it is a measure of electron density , electrostatic charge.	10.157590948580015
If you start with excess m 1, then at the beginning , you will get alternate copolymers.	7.787802130957342
In fact there are relationships available where many of the hydrodynamic and transport properties of these polymers solutions can be related to the major and minor axis of the ellipsoid particle and these are broadly the methods which are used in general to determine the dimensions of the protein molecule or the nature of conformation , if suppose we know about the native conformation , we know the dimensions and after certain treatment if the dimensions are altered we tend to understand that they have under gone a conformational change.	10.824364668531066
The primary factors responsible for the increase in adsorption with temperature are when the protein binds to a surface there is some unfolding of the protein molecules , which is an endothermic process and the increase of temperature resulting in enhanced adsorption supports the hypothesis that the binding or adsorption of a protein molecule or a polymeric material to a surface is an endothermic process coupled with unfolding of the confirmation.	11.230724688205024
A typical first order rate constant.	6.2716114447315965
So , more propagation happen.	7.185398315767035
Theoretically at equilibrium the enzyme must be available in the form of e , es , es2, , esn.	9.322757953403825
The two major attributes of an enzyme molecule is the chemical nature of the protein and their catalytic function.	8.720613728181064
In addition to that on the active site there will be many more amino acid residues which will be in the proximity and they might provide some kind of unfavorable interactions.	10.959176697851198
The minimum quantity of product you can detect will dictate the time of the reaction.	9.342087320908107
As i said is the most simple or the simplest polymerization.	9.456644256448456
Succinate as a substrate has two carboxylic groups.	12.661757856022865
Most of the enzymes are known to have a mechanism by which even their activity can be regulated not only at the biosynthesis level but at the functional level.	9.285957563783606
So , the neutral polymers are ionized or cationized by protons or metal cations like sodium , na plus , k plus or say silver plus.	8.969301537550528
So , that is the reason , that the transfer coefficient or or the transfer constant is very high for the reaction that is the tendency of oxygen molecule to undergo this reaction is very extremely high.	9.379764245568579
Ds / dx is negative and this is output of the substrate from the pore.	13.42596192276634
That is the concentration gradient.	7.655491231718229
If suppose there is no reaction taking place then along the length of the reactor at z the substrate concentration will reach to sb same as in bulk.	9.092562946681847
Whereas in the case of a saturation kinetics or hyperbolic kinetics the reaction velocity can reach to almost 0.75, 75 % of the saturation value , a very high level.	8.863705570342562
Obviously as i said that when theta is temperature is theta temperature value of polymer solvent interaction parameter chi becomes 0..	9.917612508804405
The first and probably the most trivial method is the static process.	6.345524782961709
And , if you are making a polymers , which will be like a packing film for food trapping application; then if you , if he is having anti fogging additives , then it will prevent fogging a condensation of the water moister in the packing film , which will basically allow the customers to look through that film.	9.914037298577078
So , in that case , we call as a semi - interpenetrating and when both or more than one networks are inter twingled each other , then you call as interpenetrating network.	7.993335655514589
This binding has to be oriented in such a way that the third functional group on the substrate which has to undergo reaction is brought in vicinity of the catalytic site.	8.501708417472345
So , if there is no restriction , no restriction in the chain , no restriction of bond angle and bond rotation , then whatever dimension the rms end - to - end distance you would have got , in actually you consider the bond angle restriction , and also the bond rotation restriction that would be having the rms end - to - end distance about 2 to 3 times , more than that.	7.307085232104379
To avoid this killing of the radical propagating radical by which it will stop the reaction and also reduce the molecular weight.	9.260011633521058
This true stress and this true strain is difficult to measure.	12.307075969765295
So each cell on an average , these are the assumption we are taking and on basis of which we will formulate this scattering equations.	10.981900193198518
If i make a table with the corresponding numbers , how does it look.	8.821252543408995
Amino acids residues participating in such reactions are serine , cysteine , histidine , lysine , aspartic acid and glutamic acid.	8.760658821185856
The kinetic parameter here is k2, the rate constant which is responsible for break down of enzyme substrate complex into the product.	8.636185774781914
Now if we come to the next major class of reversible inhibitor which is a non - competitive inhibitor , the classical feature of a non - competitive inhibitor in terms of binding with the enzyme or the enzyme substrate is that the inhibitor does not influence in any way the substrate binding.	9.971578781907485
Where , instead of transition metal catalyst , metallocenes are used as a catalyst along with a co - initiator; which we will discuss in a minute.	9.547531756287416
The approach of these , if it is the approach from this side , it will be even satirically hinders.	11.64574659345918
The key parameter which represents the es interaction , in our case we have noted at least for typical michaelis menten kinetics , is the km michaelis menten constant.	9.603203450860253
If you shift that ph very often gross alterations occur often called as denaturation.	9.824646312557704
So , this was equivalent to this term for simple polyethylene molecule , for a much stiffer molecules like polystyrene , we cannot get such expression what we are introducing instead of this term , we are steric parameter.	10.525343429922446
Now , as you can see , the h 2 o can take part as long as h 2 o present in medium , they can take part and hydrolyze the cyclic molecules and so that they can , cyclic molecules open up and undergo further linear polymerization or take part in further linear polymerization , and new cyclic small molecular formation take place and so on.	9.491765616471488
And these are accelerated by , this hydrolysis is accelerated by the presence of residual catalyst.	9.899378671659711
In the case of allosteric enzymes we have a simplified rate equation which can express or which can describe the rate behavior of the allosteric enzymes.	8.04616575952604
Now , i am just drawing this cartoons , they could mean they will be many micelles , so let us let me draw through here , now i am drawing a spherical micelle that does not mean that all the micelles or spherical or all the time micelles are spherical.	10.387038220232615
So , what happened , again i am saying is not a perfect material to show , if you apply the strain at much faster rate , it breaks , it shows elasticity , elastic behavior , like a solid , but when you apply this strain very slowly , then it flows up chains , actually move past each other , shows flows behavior and it shows viscous behavior.	10.218526223954294
And at the end , i planned to just give a summary of this module on step growth polymerization.	6.348639701059675
So , basically , if you want to stabilize or if you want to have a polymer made with the help of , with addition of additives , and we must know the mechanism by which the properties of the polymer deteriorates with the , in presence of light , heat , shear , during the processing or during the use of the polymers in actual application.	9.013640938058613
Now we can write general formula like this or we can write if it is substituted we can write a r instead of h and we can write this if r is ch 3, then it is isoprene; if r is chloride , then it is chloroprene.	12.404679483326584
As a result , there will be more destructive interference between the scattered lights from different parts of the polymer molecules; this scattered lights are from different parts of a polymer molecules.	8.543289945508
Another reason of the non - release of product from collisions could be that the molecules during collisions may not be in the right orientation because orientation at the time of collision may also be significant in many cases and enzyme can play a key role.	10.500937958851587
But although in a living cell various enzymes , which carry out these reactions are available their availability in large quantities for commercial applications are limited.	10.223051238588008
So , what you can do in reaction you can do in the steps , you can do the first step in a lower temperature and at higher pressure and then slowly increase the temperature and reduce the pressure.	9.264648758821808
So , mechanical properties is the most property for polymer and i will discussed the mechanical properties in the detailed.	10.984297773842112
If you consider the single substrate reaction the dissociation constant of substrate with the enzyme is analogous to km value , whereas in the case of bi - substrate reaction that situation is not true.	8.833566015313103
One must be able to identify by some analytical method or experimental method that which is the rate limiting step and we must analyze or design our reactor keeping in view the rate limiting step.	8.638194616455355
So , we will get different curve for a different polymer.	7.151213300722325
And like the step growth polymerization the molecule will depend upon the conversion , but in case of step growth the high molecules are only get high conversion.	9.539156734030383
If there are impurities present in your monomers , then you do not know , you are not sure what is the actual mole fraction or mole of the functional groups which restricts that you must have very pure monomer in order to get a successful step polymers and also at the same time , your reactor should be high enough , so that you can take out your condensate such extreme that you can push your conversion up to p.	10.323714311476948
So , with flow when this polymer mixture goes through the columns , the larger ones move faster; as a result at the end of the column or end of the path , the larger ones come out earlier and you get the smaller ones come out later.	9.901601540108503
The other effect is partitioning of substrate and product which also results in alteration in the km value of the enzyme reaction.	8.209770947904715
And that is why the value for e is quite high positive 2.25 and these values will vary it is not that these values are very fixed values , but these value might vary little bit depending up on the condition of the reaction among.	10.662282436785949
So , what are the if you look chain micro structure , or chain chemical structure , what are the factors , you can think of , which will affect the value of t m.	9.736574985970266
A number of such expressions are already available in the literature which can be used.	8.995212971734233
That means.	8.827330204283584
In the third case it is a reverse micelle.	9.317461536167416
What about the t g of co polymer , we talked about mainly last class t g of homopolymers , now what about in the t g co polymers and polymer blends , if we talk about co polymers first.	11.309542260268325
And , their uv visible spectrise zone , as you can see , from the absorbance , they actually absorb heavily in the uv range , because they absorb; they actually prevent the bulk of the polymer from getting exposed to the uv condition.	10.05077776236654
Second , we need to do a calibration the detector is typically a molecular tube; the output of the detector is proportional to the light intensity.	9.733190018348926
Now , we do not have to do ourselves; now a days fortunately software s are available which can take this and give us this output of this type of output they can give and from which using the formula which we used at the beginning.	8.582455839746546
It was mostly some very common reactions like hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose , most of the hydrolytic reactions were understood and this mechanism proposed only such a macro understanding that the substrate and the enzyme have rigid conformations which are complementary to each other and which fit in strictly.	9.88724297825844
Generally , this metal used is a group four transition metal and in most cases it is zirconium and so zirconocene is what is mostly used in case of metallocenes polymers.	11.145913122851253
So , how do you get total molecular weight.	5.218562870164246
So , that the number of tertiary , butylacrolate munities in the first block in the first block is by 4 divided by divide by 3, 4 hydrogen corresponds to 1, so 1 hydrogen corresponds to there may be a mistake i am making here , so this could be fine.	10.444279258275708
Input is pr2.d ( ds / dx ) in.	8.786194253133411
They vary among the twenty different amino acids and their sequence and the number of amino acids or the relative concentration of each of the amino acid may determine the particular type of enzymes , its characteristic properties as well as its functional aspects.	10.579929311879864
So , if i write polyethylene oxide that means oxide of polyethylene.	6.399667800284732
If i add a benzoic acid , you are going to get a molecule something like.	8.810070547196956
In most cases we start either with the monomer or a water soluble polymer.	8.393637734348573
So , x is v 2b y v 1 where v 2 is the molar volume of polymer and v 1 is the molar volume of solvent.	7.422107456931724
Now , if they are free , then obviously , they are more accessible and the reactivity of this propagating species , ionic propagating species are much more reactive or much more reactive compared to situation when they are tight ion - pair.	9.061899846599864
They are used to determine r 1 and .	10.819852979104793
This is the molar volume and this is total volume.	8.229530244239486
So , the chain keep on propagating there is no reaction between two monomers or there is no reaction between two high molecular polymer chain as well.	8.166702766067425
If you are looking through a hazy material.	8.04410417943846
I am saying exceptions which are rare examples where the enzyme activity after the immobilization has also been analyzed.	11.079642537068873
One of the major contributions of michaelis and menten was that he confirmed brown s observation that enzyme substrate interaction undergoes formation of enzymes substrate complex.	8.148883073767603
This effectiveness factor has a number of characteristics; one is that in most cases the effectiveness factor will be less than or equal to one because the present support diffusional limitations will always reduce the substrate concentration in the particle surface.	10.045683675903497
What is the necessary for having more than one molecular weights for a given polymer sample.	10.226789194384514
So , as the reactivity of the ionic centre , obviously , the free is the ionic center it gets , it becomes more reactive.	9.242129185302618
F1 that is the line corresponds to f 1 is f .	12.599657158520417
So , what will be.	6.287362035547588
So , this is additional term appearing , and this o is for the subscript for end - to - end distance , for a chain rms end - to - end distance for a polymer chain which has both one angle rotation , and also short range steric , rotational restriction due to short range steric interactions.	7.763967515599476
These are basically depending up on the applications where you are the polymers is find the application.	9.760697440402266
Now in thermodynamics , we can have two types of transition; first order phase transition and second order phase transition.	11.150910182815288
So , easy this hydrogen can be very easy accept by the propo vinyl acetate radicals , why using this type of chain transfer tri ethyl are butane thiol compounds the compounds you can reduce are control your molecular weight much to of your choose or if your target.	10.523848252391918
Now , why we are doing this extrapolation.	9.459829855559402
So , for this class , it is not possible to cover all the examples.	7.650307806917594
On the other hand , the diffusional process within the pores of the particle or internal pore diffusion.	6.394640753430963
You must incorporate partitioning effects also in the steady state analysis.	10.201816033255453
Now this can break into two species , let us write in the next page.	8.430969636337355
Obviously , the target application has to be kept in mind , which , for which application we want to use that additive.	10.39025833462367
Now , in this case reaction is kinetically controlled , which means once the polymer all as a matter of cyclics we just talked about few minutes back.	8.199632544115325
We will try to see whether , now , the necessity of , we can explain with the , why with that , what is the necessity of this define molecular weights.	10.738864429530702
Bi - bi means two substrates and two products.	11.783730740398774
Just a recap , the factors which will that influence glass transition temperature , mainly we can divide in two factors; one is free volume , free volume is the volume in polymer material , which is not covered by the polymer molecules , and as we have seen that , if we increase the free volume content in a polymeric material or sample , the polymers has more space to move around , so mobility goes up.	9.718927421698421
This is the chain end; this monomer will come and add to this and the chain will propagate.	9.336902563548
You don t take a preformed carrier but some carrier with some functional groups.	8.728994170308901
So , how many moles of monomers has reacted to form polymers , is basically 600 moles of monomers reacted to form polymer chains.	8.264492518208975
You can show schematically , how this potential energy varies with different conformation , which is obtained by changing the dihedron angle , this one is the planar trans conformation which as i showed , because these two methyl groups are extremely apart , they have the least potential energy.	10.651452373924169
In the case of pet.	7.644455887956069
As we have seen that or you know the place of the molecules in the first neighbor , in a solution or in a liquid is quite established , whereas the place of the second neighbor and third neighbor and so on , it will become uncertain.	11.155033641880072
Here you have the active site , the sites on which the binding groups available on the substrate binds and this portion shows the substrate which is analogous to the key.	10.974494401098932
Ok . now , let us come back to today s topic of lecture about amorphous and crystalline state.	10.378343995311743
This is one of the most important advantages of using polymers which gives you excellent strength to weight ratio.	8.4484272524323
Now , that is the only possible , if this polymers are live that means they do not undergo this bimolecular termination reaction , if they undergo bimolecular termination reaction they will be dead immediately , and they will not be able to continue the propagation chain.	9.812656775228186
Now in case of atactic you also can you can also write m m and r r is one fourth; whereas m r , if you have this fifty fifty , then obviously this m r , the combination of m and r tryad will be half.	10.883405635017667
These are the main type of photo initiator or photo chemical initiator used in commercial applications.	8.447909344217036
Now , each temperature you can consider , your reaction temperature you can consider as a ceiling temperature.	7.779790394788179
So , this polymer is generally formed by hydrolysis of the polyvinyl acetate , but if you look without knowing that that it has synthesized from hydrolysis of these you can imagine or hypothesize that it has been synthesized from this monomer which is vinyl and alcohol.	9.501793123523967
You can see that the same alcohol dehydrogenase can follow different mechanisms.	7.846581167294071
In this case , x n bar degrees of polymerization of 100 and if this molecular is not sufficient enough , then you have to keep the reaction even longer to high the conversion and hence , higher the molecular weight of the polymers.	8.143711692969058
The examples we have just seen ethylene styrene butadiene isoprene etcetera , and if the monomer containing electron donate withdrawing group , then it the polymer visibility of the double bond actually goes up , because the reasons we just talked about in last time fifteen minutes.	10.950405966426665
So , theta temperature the this becomes 0, so the solutions become ideal solutions and polymer exist in solution with unperturbed dimensions.	9.07679598160582
So , you will land up something like this.	4.947055596501213
What ever kind of isotherm you get , you just raise to a factor of n and by analysis of your data you will calculate the value of k and n.	9.491551757141941
So , to strain a fiber , you have to apply a very high stress.	9.177425425550302
Lot of applications of polystyrene goes as foam.	13.215068237252868
So , basically the polymers we deal in the lab sometimes we do not require detectors of so many angles may be one detectors at low angles could be sufficient for determination of the molecular weight.	8.443160989142145
You know this assumption is reasonably okay to do is one; the eta specific viscosity is given by the summation of the specific viscosity of the individual chains.	9.280024004146206
They can range from hydrolysis to polymerization.	8.826035988596571
So , basically , if you want to stabilize polyvinyl chloride , you basically want to have a mechanism by which you can trap chloride chlorine radical , or you can destroy this allophonic or arylic double bonds which is producing , getting produced during the degradation process.	8.4688254624669
They will not change at all because there is no change in thermal energy in the system delta h m is .	10.183485308539817
First one is , thermal initiator , and thermal initiator is , a initiation by homolicious of a molecule , by thermal energy , leading to formation of two radicals , and the typically.	11.445336384075377
On the other side if you take let us say two different substrate concentrations required for two different levels of activity to reach for example say between 0.75 and 0.1, that is substrate concentration for reaction velocity to reach 0.75 and 0..	11.034448873796034
This gives phi 1 x n 2 is n 1 phi .	10.455497260305233
I have taken hypothetically ea it could be eb also and only one of the binary complex has to trigger the enzyme substrate interaction and then the other substrate will interact with the ea complex.	11.78756051442578
This matrix within which the enzyme is entrapped must be tight enough to prevent the release of the protein and allow the substrate or product molecule to pass through the boundaries.	10.9675291381204
Only difference is the ph requirement in the three cases.	8.471217123311138
Now let us talk about low concentration of siloxane; say about 5 to 10 percentage , we are talking about thermoplastics.	8.160115293995268
Now , we have listed here the values for two monomers , polymerization two monomers polymerization styrene and polymerization of vinyl acetate.	8.589829041650939
Now , if you decrease the temperature both , the normal propagation and this inter - molecular circulation slow down , decreases.	8.126876898623461
It is a very , very significant increase in the reaction rate constant and it will give the rate of reaction under any given set of conditions.	9.769216697223515
Secondly the substrate or the product of the reaction which comes out as a result of this interaction must be able to generate a measurable parameter which can be measured by transducer in quantitative terms so that it can be related with either the substrate concentration or some species in the sample.	10.02032926095247
So , kns would be proportional to length density.	8.58269750879066
Eyring s transition state theory states that for each reaction to occur it must pass through a transition state which is an unstable state of the molecules or unstable state some where in between the reactants and the products and which has much higher energy than possessed by the reactants of the ground state.	10.29372210963123
It will take some time whereas if the biochemical reaction is also taking place at the substrate then that length required will be given by z2 at substrate concentration ss.	10.094820618434905
So , the optimum loading of the additives is what required.	8.452557980891898
So , we talked about compatible polymer blend and polymer alloy are basically immiscible polymer blends with modified interface.	8.326767313711242
But , in actual sense , if you one bonds of you have said this is one bond , now what was doing in the model we were basically putting one top of it , in the same on the paper itself and we are calculating the dimension.	11.40470413393758
Now , this expression can be rearranged and written like this.	6.389130645255008
Typically , we use concentration detector.	9.638289063197822
L is less than one f is approximately equal to one , no diffusion control.	6.986009483547975
Very often when into a reaction mixture if you have added an inhibitor molecule , one can remove it by physical method say for example by dialysis or ultra filtration or any of those methods.	11.437116679023676
Now , it , we have given examples of cation and anion here where the propagating species is b plus , is said the both cationic polymerization , the propagating species in cationic polymerization.	9.431665116796323
In a chromatographic poly , these polystyrene columns are made by these , this cross linked polystyrene beads.	10.07412095016909
And , so , a understanding of the mutual interaction between this additives are essential for making an optimal formulations.	10.560369810812057
If the conversion level is not very high then the reactor performance will be controlled by zero order kinetics.	8.320402943244355
So , we need to convert the voltage output to the intensity.	5.739126978745802
That means from the initial slope , the value of slope doubles and that concentration of inhibitor gives you the magnitude of ki.	10.035016762004753
So , these two carbon atom where you have four different substitutions.	9.479782823167714
It may look little unorthodox and because km and vm we know are constants.	10.296988944848191
They could distinguish between the conformations of the substrate molecule and have much detailed information.	10.395284407564615
Example is lactate dehydrogenase which is a tetramer consisting of four polypeptide chains.	12.206874368808926
So , if you understand the thermodynamics of polymer solution for synthetic polymers , you will also be able to easily understand the behavior of macromolecules in solution biomacromolecules in solution.	9.608208131373887
In the case of cstr , the most favorable point is that for reactions which are substrate inhibited , cstr is a desirable feature.	7.512619333602503
This is just to complete your knowledge on the radical chain polymers.	7.537865507586621
And as a result the solvent vapor will condense on this thermistor and the heat of condensation will increase the temperature of this thermistor and equilibrium should arise where the vapor pressure of the solvent in this elevated temperature is same as the vapor pressure of the pure solvent in the temperature of the thermostat.	8.772493817357297
Now that will depend up on which get priority whether this one or this one.	7.758061835416712
As i mentioned some time earlier also that the adsorption process undergoes slight unfolding of the enzyme protein and unfolding of the enzyme protein is an endothermic process which results in reduction in the optimum temperature; alkylation by covalent binding is 45c , entrapment is 50c.	10.126654936965878
In this case also there could be other reagents possible , which you , if you add or present are as impurities , it can retard or inhibit the chain polymerization , cationic chain polymerization.	9.559494460664546
If you increase the number of micelles , then it is likely that number of micelles is taking part in polymerization is more compared to a situation , we you have less number of micelle.	9.014148581397121
Let me once delta h m by delta s m.	8.852758463797215
So that , after the part is formed , it can easily taken out from the mold , there is screws , it basically melts and mix those those polymers with additives here and this screw by rotating it , takes it forward.	10.66585304252784
So , third thing you can do as i was mentioning is that you change the catalyst or sometimes catalyst a i said might accelerate the side reactions as well.	9.21313858532865
Another important feature of michaelis menten kinetics is to define specificity constant.	8.136730335490903
Otherwise those molecular weights will not contribute in the osmotic pressure and hence the determined m n number average molecular weight.	8.21262875011702
You change any of these three; polymer solvent or temperature , it will vary; the value of k h will vary.	10.73934305594614
So , which means that for a pure monomer t c is much lower for alpha methyl styrene compared to a styrene which means that alpha methyl styrene cannot be polymerized.	11.061710913997866
So inhibition by the product or the effect of product concentration on the reaction rate has been negligible.	10.516501746396123
The precise reason for that is amino acid side chains cannot catalyze all the chemical reactions.	9.878643831243545
So if you want to carry out those reactions in high concentration you need a non - polar bulk medium and the substrate can be dissolved and then they can be used for enzymatic catalysis.	8.638667424107823
Now , how to , how to sort of read these equations.	9.155225605360545
If it is a water soluble polymer , one can also induce cross linking by certain conditions so that it becomes water insoluble and the enzyme gets trapped into the matrix.	8.987732679051813
The other issue a very general issue about the feature of enzymes and proteins is the bio synthesis and regulation.	10.464034982794825
So , what is done is a semi empirical scheme.	6.394244036215391
Now t g is basically plot of white class of temperature , is just nothing but plot of weight or mass to utilize for this , the temperature.	10.304794359613963
In fact any immobilized enzyme system has three major constituents , three major players the first player is the soluble enzyme.	8.618200764829819
The output will be similar for a given concentration of different molecular weight.	7.765803760407032
So , what is the average degrees of polymerization , number of monomers polymerized divided by number of polymer chains.	5.973016477771341
And generally , highly aromatic polymers and halogen containing polymers are inherently better fire retardant.	10.209532568128921
This effect of entropic contribution to the energy of activation is called approximation effect or propinquity effect.	8.937984969087111
By the experimental reactor operations in the laboratory many people have noticed that diffusional limitations play a key role either by varying the agitation speed in the case of a cstr or by the varying the linear flow velocity in the case of pfr , the rate of reaction can be improved and so diffusional limitations can be overcome if any.	8.590676549535084
That is why some times it call as a bead or a pearl polymerization.	9.068395772095993
Porosity is the basis for classification of carriers.	14.047689802846229
Milk contains primarily lactose as a principle sugar and this lactose is an undesirable sugar for certain adults.	12.486687663070436
A disadvantage is that the preparations do not have very high operational stability.	9.79489452330797
So , what type of proton or carbon they are , intensity of the signals will be proportional to the number of protons or carbons contributing to a signal , so obviously , the signal from two protons will be double than the signal from one proton.	9.922138081028335
So , time being we are not spending much time on these techniques.	9.203433428649474
Now , with the original definition of addition and condensation polymers , you will definitely classify as a condensation reaction because in this reaction , small molecules are coming out.	9.422929157993783
Another feature is that not all the twenty amino acids that are present in protein are involved in active sites.	8.5413369274567
So , in that case what is done the polymers as comes out from plant is taken to a step , taken through a step , a polymer processing step which are commonly called compound where the polymer either in a melt form or in powder form is mixed with the required additives or property enhanced enhancing fillers or sometimes with other polymers as well to make polymer blends and you get a intermediate product , is like pellets.	9.901816308033357
Collagen which is a structure of protein , is found in the slaughter house waste.	12.51193913811156
This is the only one classical example where an enzyme can act on both stereoisomers.	8.837234730914043
It is a theoretical value.	8.224662856194943
If it is very fast radical generation , then the reaction will be extremely fast , and because this chain polymerization is exothermic , reaction is very fast , and you can imagine the amount of heat generated , during the reaction , which could be a hazard , it can actually explode , if it the reaction which is too high , and if is too slow then your reaction will take much longer , your radical generation is too low , then your reaction will take much longer time.	10.034689106110957
That is why , leaving anionic polymer polymerization , leaving anionic polymerization is comparatively easier than cationic polymerization because you , in case of cationic polymerization , these transfer reactions are very common and fissile , where in case of anionic this transfer reaction is required beta hydride elimination , which is , which is not easy thing.	9.699673992783184
Again , this is the summation of the concentration of all the cationic species , propagating species present in the medium.	7.8789100988388325
That is partitioning of the hydrogen ions between the bulk and the carrier particle.	5.970808862367907
Because the co - substrate is water which is present in large quantity and one can use them for hydrolytic reactions.	10.12101156431464
Why we extrapolate.	16.191822338402353
So , this is again let me repeat this d w is the weight fraction of the polymer chains which eluted between v e and v e plus d v e.	6.380512587376665
Or , in other words , all the radicals which are getting generated by homiletic cleavage of this benzyl peroxide , they are not participating , or they are not initiating a chain; which means , that is the , they are getting lost in doing non polymerization reaction.	10.883375749708403
The second case is about the pore diffusion which in fact is much more pronounced in the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions because in the case of porous matrices a very large surface area where the enzyme is present is through the pore surface in the catalyst particle and so the second case is if we consider a porous matrix in which the enzyme is immobilized throughout will provide you the case of a pore diffusion regimes.	9.706816849256473
So , we can add the additives which can trap this radical r dot or proxy radicals , which is done by adding primary anti oxidant; we can increase the rate of termination reaction , which is done by adding hinder diamine.	9.437709531532903
Similar situation will apply if you consider k a . kb + kb . a kmapp for b = ka + a again here also similarly you will notice k a = ka; kmapp for b kb this here also k a = ka.	9.501918856066078
While cross linking may become a useful method in the laboratory in the form of the gelatinous mass for the practical reactor operation the gelatinous mass does not offer useful flow properties in the reactors for a continuous reactor.	9.641856917209669
And because you are continually stirring this actually stabilized the suspension , so the poly.	11.178662990713947
So the urea concentration in the blood stream increases and it can cause many metabolic problems and it is ultimately fatal.	11.599070277932698
Consider another situation in which at the low substrate concentration when.	10.879024507322018
For in practice , most of the industrial polymers at the end of the polymers , if you measure the molecular weight distribution , you find , no it is found that pdi is slightly more than 2, not much say , 2.2, 2.5, something like that.	9.851125756001771
So , if we plot log of size against v e you can expect that to be a linear graph.	9.511388005996514
In higher frequency large numbers of total molecules that are present participate in the reaction process , a feature which will result in higher reaction rate.	10.135433148033801
For example , a raft transfer agent is , we can give as simple example of transfer reaction.	9.030862196227675
And if you compare with other monomers so like other conjugate diene like isoprene and butadiene because there they can easily stabilize the radical by resonance , their reactivity is high so q is high.	8.760770631861561
We determine the absorbance at 280 which gives you very precise information about the concentration of protein in the sample and this absorbance is based on the content of amino acid residues tyrosine and tryptophan in the protein which are more or less universally present in most of the enzyme samples.	11.051597809411769
So the chain continues and you get nylon.	11.189923274773315
This term , as we , this is again.	13.311223409885669
Monomer gets coordinated to the vacant or empty d - orbital.	10.888252239432687
I have 25 a a type monomer one , another 25 b b type monomer.	9.426180561405308
So , these examples showing as these lewis acids , which we just showed in the last page , they are often used along with a second catalyst or cocatalyst , which can be water molecules or some other molecules.	8.872047171625775
Kd . t = s0 ( xt - x0 ) + s0 ln ( x0 / xt ) + km ln km + s0 ( 1 - x0 ) / km + s0 ( 1 - xt ) this is for cstr.	10.327708656490673
As you reach more complexity in terms of more enzyme substrate complexes the mathematical analysis becomes more and more complex and there are routes by which one can write straight away by observation the rate expression and we will discuss that in the subsequence classes.	10.665723740038915
Last time we were discussing about the application of the immobilized enzymes and we had mentioned that the enzymes find applications in a variety of situations and we dealt with the applications of immobilized enzymes as industrial biocatalyst in process industries.	9.770717983748
There is another very interesting feature as far as the michaelis menten equation is concerned.	7.53723370474393
So , we will , even without pushing the reaction to very high conversion we can make high molecular weight in this case.	8.733907813540304
Basically , the liquids , 2 liquids actually vaporized in the same mole fraction in the vapor phase.	10.512592149095926
And then , the company takes it and put the data in it and put the decoration and finally , sell it as a product.	8.773280339534704
But binary complex cannot lead to a product.	10.065216871652359
So , you can also polymerize with strong nucleophiles as well , but this type of monomers can be polymerized anionically by weak , very weak nucleophiles.	8.26917985160723
Now , why do we started our discussion on chain polymerization.	6.071055319041213
Now in this case , this , the bond c n bond is not , this bond is not of the , having that bond dissociation energy , between 100 to 170 kilo joule per mol; that s the bond energy , optimal bond energy talked about.	9.06725475175592
One of them is out of the way and requires some distortion.	10.395009826112888
So , the polymer matrix becomes yellow , and this process also , the polymer property polymer molecular drops , and the property of the polymers become significantly lower compared to what it was originally after the molding.	11.271494319922391
Reactor performance from rtd also can be obtained and one can compare if you consider the ideal reactor flow profile and also the real reactor flow profile and compare their performance and comparison will give you the deviation from the ideality.	11.034415440957998
Now z , because z is quite high so i can again put z equals to minus z minus .	10.471981601644726
Based on that mechanism then the rate expression has evolved which also has characteristic features and for particular class of inhibitor.	10.10430445499752
So , the reaction rate will be faster and high molecular weight produced and it will you do not need to process it.	8.806336448185274
So , n which is the number of molecules left over , each molecules which is left over now in the polymerization medium which have two functional groups.	8.099395810071124
First we have looked at the binding pattern.	9.873049851729775
So , when you do reaction base to s to disallowed that benzoquinone hydroquinone stabilizer or inviter or you can add little excess initiator compensating the inviter molecule.	9.305434411514206
So , it is always desirable to have your reaction stopped or at the end of the reaction , you get whatever you target it for.	6.106026340507088
We have seen earlier that your molecular goes up , critical composition also goes down.	7.421953562493274
This is what happened.	5.631848251516897
If this ligand , they follow this , so obviously , if the ligands are fluorine or chloride , they have much more lewis acidity compared to the ligands are , this is , this is from your basic knowledge from inorganic chemistry , basic knowledge and this is , from this expression , you know , this is strongest lewis acid and this is , not always we use this though it is a very strong lewis acid , for all the cationic reaction.	11.708508068502061
Now , if you add monomer , now obviously there will be slight solubility , very slight solubility , so you have i write m for the monomer , so you have few monomer molecules , very small amount of monomer i write m , they are dissolved in water.	9.720307928742226
So , you have a elastomer.	7.133350731596382
Lot of time they do not mix , you know , we will talk about , maybe , later , later part of the this course , that polymers usually , hike , high molecular polymers , they do not exactly mix well.	10.552511620641184
Now , at higher temperature , if we increase t temperature , then this second term , t del s , becomes higher and higher.	9.804387875836333
It involves the metal salt linkage.	7.835284071580317
So , these are lewis , lewis acid can be used for supplying an electrophile for reaction with the monomer , but it is this lewis acids are seldom used alone.	9.85611046098878
It should be given by the ratio of rate of propagation with rate of propagation plus rate of termination plus rate of transfer.	11.562116400419821
The orientation of the monomer as it inserts into the metal carbon bond , determines the configuration of the stereo center in the newly formed terminal unit.	9.804939520815124
If you talk about backbone stiffness , then they increase the modulus , and strength.	8.957364292047934
E r in this case means , for redox initiation , again we will be coming around 40 kilo joule per mol.	9.958132866238058
In the case of enzymes which are immobilized by carrier binding methods , for example , either by adsorption or by covalent binding where there are no there are no likelihood of much temperatures gradient in the bulk and the enzyme active site this can be very easily checked.	10.130984824501386
So , without knowing both the molecular wise m n bar m n , if you know only of them and you have given the structures , one structure , if know that this is made by step polymerization , if you are given only one of them.	10.665568185909096
Now , there is a nucleophilic attack by this initiator and the ring will open up.	7.699113310513128
Similarly in the case of es it will be k2.k - .	9.82006033545155
We also discussed at the end different ways of a molecule , whether it is a monomer or a oligomer , can undergo cyclization and we will continue that discussion today.	10.170110243528633
And eta s p you know if you recollect; eta s p is eta r minus 1, eta by eta 0 minus .	10.573319261052628
So , the main degradation happened by dehydrochlorination as shown in this figures.	9.031536247587798
The step polymerization is never practiced in a closed system is always done where you take out the condensate from the reaction medium and in continuation , we found that we understood that it is not always possible to take out 100 percent of the condensate which is produced , getting produced in the reaction.	9.24200737903322
So , the polymerization is highly favorable , same polymerization highly favorable.	8.858851841300611
Now the michaelis menten kinetics can still apply to those reactions provided the inter conversion of the complexes is assumed to be the rate limiting step.	8.900212681107911
So for a given state , we know from out statistical thermodynamics or statistical mechanics that boltzmann equation gives the relation between the combinatorial entropy and w which is the number of possible distinguishable degenerate arrangement.	10.127515550352417
So , at t g what are the transition takes place at in terms of molecular and if you think about polymer molecules , the intermolecular van der waals forces they breakdown.	11.472521701422107
We have till now done the gibbs free energy of mixing for solution ideal solution for small molecules.	6.928588600405238
If you take repeat unit , you will be doubling the calculated molecular weight m n for this.	8.707066521993703
It s not a very large number compared to the feasibility of combinations that are feasible.	9.806827303010442
Activate those functional groups by certain reagent and then the activated functional groups or activated matrix can react directly with the enzyme functional group to give you an immobilized preparation.	11.123196363928358
Let us understand , every , if you can , you can consider every temperature , you can consider every temperature as , you can consider whatever reaction you are doing as a ceiling temperature.	9.986945007652634
In this case , you have seen the chain growth , of course in aluminum bond.	7.607389028200592
Now they can have a trans arrangement as well.	7.734988136013277
Now , what i am trying to understand , how the approach , how , what the theoretical approach is made to find out the end to end distance , root mean square end to end distance for a random coil; and this is how it is made.	7.873547230395087
But when you talk about enzymatic catalysis this loss of entropy is compensated by binding process.	8.001979955809961
For example if i take a car head lamp cover , the cover of the car head lamp is nowadays made from polycarbonate material.	8.090953927011748
As an example if you look at some of the optimum ph of the immobilized preparations , which are reported in literature you notice that in most cases here the effects are mostly on ionic binding.	10.052374682592507
Now , we know that in case of anionic polymerization the initiation is faster.	5.904296803574839
An initiation consist of 2 steps : 1 - initiator molecules produce 2 radical species , which is the initiating radical or is called the primary radical.	10.850325421924818
So , it will look something like this , where this is the direction of pp is 1 in this case , and the other curves are for lower p which means for a given r , you take any of the r here.	10.809743748744848
That means all the seats in this class are totally vacant.	8.90182288029548
So , name accordingly.	8.950753173864253
So , this gives the number of monomers reacted divided by the number of chains formed which gives you the degree of polymerization and in this case , this is the transfer reaction.	7.630914980650359
But the product formation will take place only after the ternary complex formation has begun.	9.812137054806675
This reagent is very commonly used for all crosslinking experiments even routine as well as for practical.	11.22775526755783
This sleeve is just to insert the enzyme membrane on to the electrode as a as a.	10.376238352236081
And , so what happened.	6.438864753861348
This alkyl aluminum compound gets chemisorbed.	12.566579598868648
M 1 star will only react with m 2, and m 2 star will only react with m 1 and so on , so you have a perfectively alternate copolymer , just alternate arrangement of the monomers , and f 1 and f 2 both will be fifty percent in this case.	9.979858136693435
This was we discussed case number a , and next talk about case number b , where we have r 1 and r 2 is 0, so either we can r 1 and r 2 is both are zero.	8.646915113011708
In addition to that , the understanding of the enzyme inhibitors or activators gives us very precise information on the specificity.	10.354761533806133
The linear polymerization , typically useful commercial applications have molecular weight , it is 50000 to 150000, pdi 2 to 4 and t g is around 85 degree centigrade and it is very rigid polymers because backbones is having aromatic structures.	12.433087832603615
So , their as the layer has to be dismandled and dispersed like , what is shown here and we call this as exfoliated nanocomposite.	11.489881001130867
So at even a higher bulk ph at the enzyme reactive site the ph will be lower and so we will consider it almost like an apparent shift in the optimum ph on the alkaline side and the reverse is true.	9.731297206061797
So , a polymer resulting from m m a will be much more strained compared to a polymer from just methyl acrylate.	9.135883213076934
Normally , inefficient propagation termination and secondary and branching reactions.	10.314940761333894
Protein concentration will be important and we have seen from the adsorption isotherm itself.	11.902471686873215
Now ideal solution is a mixture of molecules having identical size.	10.059144385453646
You require a ether atom , which will actually enabled electrophilic or a nucleophilic attack by external agents by which the rings will open.	11.58913160535257
So that you insert on the tip the enzyme membrane.	10.407966163106249
These polymers are recyclable.	13.961650350611812
In this case you get the product as this.	6.704903849575353
So in case of enzyme reactions where enzymes have a very high activity or in other words a few are able to make a preparation which has a very high enzyme loading that means the amount of enzymes in terms of international units per gram of the carrier particle if that can be increased to a significant level , then the system can be operated which is under diffusion limitations.	11.032262418465043
Whereas in t g , the glass transition temperature which varies discontinuity with the second derivative of the gibbs free energy function.	7.900914520190466
They are porous in nature but they are usually flexible in the pore size or thermoelastic and the pore is flexible and the typical examples which have been used are collagen , poly acrylamide , gelatin and a large number of other gel structures have been used.	9.57465209720925
We had earlier discussed the reactor performance equations for three different types of reactors that i used for carrying out the enzyme catalyzed reactions; that is batch , plug flow reactor and continuous stirred tank reactor.	9.298799675323867
Hence it is a soft material.	12.24606540822517
So , we can , for large x , we can remove or discard this term , ignore this term.	7.657745207143544
Under different sets of conditions , under the requirement of the reaction systems , the process requirement one has to make a choice and compare interms of the overall productivity or the desired parameter.	11.300885293904187
So , this c h 3 has higher than c h 2 than the votronic carbon atom this is the size of the group so the size increases wander walls force is increases so increases.	9.745848270168509
Similarly , this side , it will react with b , other side will be a.	7.2873485459361005
Is the electrostatic potential difference between the two phases , k is the boltzmann constant and t is the absolute temperature.	6.575585158426274
If p is close to 1, pdi is almost in every case is close to .	9.268966881464406
A curved one , the deviation of this from the vertical absorption gives the non - ideality.	11.88130805496367
That means either a substrate inhibition or a product inhibition or a third inhibitor an external inhibitor available in that.	8.072530143325634
In dilute polymer solution , we can assume the following reasonably well.	10.653711179007438
L will be less than one or a smaller value.	10.43603805934384
I will take these factors one by one and give examples; few real examples to emphasize or convince you or the how this factors effects the t g of a polymer material or a polymer.	9.401506414232552
If it reacts with itself , it will form hexamer.	9.357975563853582
But practically if you notice you will never get an integer value.	10.585366257533735
So , it has a non - regular structure.	7.893118917913231
In general there will be a decline in productivity as fractional conversion increases but the relative decrease will be more pronounced in the case of cstr than in pfr.	9.58701540740662
Consider this iso poly isoprene and poly chloroprene; this is chloroprene and this is isoprene.	12.56081261721823
When the 10 percent monomer in the solution the reaction you are doing in a dilute condition the heat management is very good , viscosity is not high , so no gel effect happen.	8.994785526957992
If the kinetic regime of the reaction is in the zero order that means the km in both the expressions will be deleted.	11.276377792678012
Yes . you are right that this free carboxylic group will be available for adsorbing some proteins which are negatively charged and that s why we try to remove this charge group so that it doesn t interfere during the reaction.	9.553187203074362
Formation of cyclic in a step polymerization is always present in little amount , so that its contribution to your pdi to be little lower.	11.749513362557018
If strain is not developed it will remain in the binding site but not at the active site.	8.624174813426869
And there are other possible initiation reactions , which we will discuss in the next lecture where inherently , there could be termination reactions possible.	8.561991275226326
If the outlet substrate concentration is also very high compare to the inlet substrate concentration the reaction can be considered or atleast approximated to be equal to zero order kinetics but if the conversion is very high so that the outlet substrate concentration is very low then you can always approximate to be a first order reaction.	10.293082961699925
The time required for the reaction to be carried out will be considered on the basis of the detection method of the product so that you can accurately determine the product.	8.964414122025167
So , i can write this x n reaction for this h a represents the acid.	6.843209791916159
This is the enzyme entrapped in the reverse micelle.	7.6395443147474875
Now , there are so many other example i can give where , polymers are used for medical application where , they are in contact with the biological fluids , may be blood or serum or or tissues and so on.	8.482231225069945
In the substrate concentration profile here we consider this as single pore and this pore refers to half the particle depth.	10.249504206658704
So , beyond this stress , beyond this strain , the polymer start deforming permanently so , up to this , is an elastic linear elastic limit and up to from here to here , it is nonlinear elastic limit.	11.202699731746742
So , if you have more interaction between , so if you have higher size , higher chain length obviously , the size will go up , as you have seen that we discussed just now , that the chain length goes up the molecular goes up , the size will the size will be higher , so viscosity will be higher.	8.612678069904119
So , for those small molecules the excess rayleigh ratio is does not depend on the theta is basically have same value for a different angles and we call this is isotropic scatterer; remember , this we are talking about excess rayleigh ratio not the scattering intensity.	9.21230191411877
On the other hand it can also happen that the substrate concentration drops to zero earlier than the substrate has reached to the middle point and therefore this portion which is highlighted here is deprived of the substrate and the overall reaction rate that is observed apparently is much smaller.	9.270997895225397
So , this is the least p and this is your intermediate p and this is your highest p.	8.143421444195383
Here in this case this also explains how the energy of activation is reduced in terms of its enthalpic contribution.	10.789800087553443
At initial time there will be no enzyme substrate complex and that can give you simply the value of alpha as a = ln ( k1e0s ) / ( - k1s + k - 1 + k2 ) so now you substitute the value of alpha and there by get your final solution to the two integrals and if you take exponential on both the sides and simplify you will come out with an expression v = k2 x and v can be developed and with just two three iterations in between you will arrive at v = k2x = vms { 1 - exp [ - ( k1s + k - 1 + k2 ) t ] / km + s in this exponential term if we consider that t is very small that means right from the beginning of the reaction the steady state hypothesis is not valid.	9.744862768033947
If the reaction has to progress to an extent that the t gets a magnitude and the exponential term tend to go towards zero.	8.974133899588011
When you increase fractional conversion the productivity will go down and for the first order regime the productivity of pfr will be much , much higher than the cstr.	8.908138270195952
That means for any given reaction you need a specific enzyme and such specificity has both advantages as well as disadvantages.	10.792259521015163
So , when we are considering rate of initiation , we are only taking or only considering , considering this k d , not the k i.	9.931478976577074
Here you notice that in the case of the immobilize enzyme unlike a soluble enzyme what we are conventionally used to where the enzyme is in direct proximity with the substrate and can interact and reaction can take place without any resistance other than the chemical reaction , the biochemical reaction.	9.856544612102532
At the end as a this will remain leaving the only thing in case of cationic polymerization , as you can imagine that if your chain is havingis a linear chain at the end you have a cationic group and anionic counter end then you can oxygen here , then it can do intra molecular reaction and form a linear molecule as a ring molecule.	10.494471230420787
Now , in first order transitions what happened.	6.4017869947223565
So , the volume fraction of the solvent would be that , forbidding that , each segment or each neighborhood has a solvent molecule.	7.816568768443849
Say this point in this point it will be similar to this curve , similarly same in this case , but if this has to phase separate if i consider this point which has this value of pie 2, if this has to separate phase separate into two phases having composition between this point and this point.	9.60167002987565
If you have the chain transfer reagents are present , chain transfer reaction actually limit the molecular built and more the amount of chain transformation , lower is the molecular weight and we have seen that.	9.879151136397871
Various types of inputs can be given and ultimately at the end of it we need to monitor the response of the tracer in the exit stream mid time and the record of this gives you a picture of the residence time distribution.	10.43121256404781
Welcome back; in this class , i will continue with the introduction of polymers.	8.315186215019777
Ultimately at equilibrium or in steady state condition the net effect will be that the bulk of the enzyme will be in the form of ess.	9.27324608641256
Vm v = km + s ( 1 + i / ki ) to bring it to the same format of michaelis menten equation , if you can divide both numerator and denominator by ( 1 + i / ki ) s.	6.966606347790494
For dispersing the enzyme into an organic solvent you are starting from enzyme which is already dispersed in some aqueous medium and whatever ph was of that medium , the enzyme retains that ph in the memory and the functional aspect of the enzyme when it is transferred to non - polar medium remains at the same ph.	11.29558669953577
Type 2 where we said that we can control the molecular weight by adding a mono - functional group , mono - functional compound or monomer substance whatever.	10.577410223530343
In the polymers , you are going to get a atactic polymerization.	8.217198819846192
No; enzyme is not leaving direct contact with the anode and cathode.	14.97661587656984
Now , if you know the dependence of chi with temperature then you can find out the spinodal points; and the critical points is given by this expression.	7.500144389583518
This in general you can write as v / vm = s / ks ( 1 + s / ks ) n - 1 ( 1 + s / ks ) n if you just extrapolate the number of binding sites from two to four to six to n , these are the kind of rate expression you end up.	8.808398953864138
We have time , say it minutes , 200,400, 600, 800 and so on and this axis , we have percentage conversion.	10.25536036029883
So , a polymer can have amorphous material.	7.00211239111574
Now , let us go back and just look at the initiation process once again.	7.007774054305776
Both groups being in the ionized form , if it is the active form then you can see the effect of addition of acid or base in this equilibrium.	11.644673409664815
So , what is r p.	5.577622238590697
As we have seen that , in deriving this expression or against expression , only we are interested in the first neighbor.	8.913371070010486
These expressions are flory - fox equation and remember as we said this expansion factor is for large expansion , it was proportional to n to the power one - tenth.	9.97606584688982
So , as the temperature goes up , this is temperature , as the temperature goes up the critical temperature also goes down and the critical composition at which the phase separation take place , they also become lower , lower; this is experiment cup which we just seen from theoretical calculation that if the temperature goes up both t c goes up and the phi 2 comes down.	9.23919878173105
Therefore if you just write a material balance for such a reactor system you can write accumulation as v . ds / dt = fs0 fs v . v fs0 is the input; s is the substrate concentration in the outlet and v is the reaction velocity that is the conversion due to the reaction and v is the reactor volume.	11.235476424037914
So you get the hexamethylene diamine derivative of the cellulose where you have already separated the matrix by six ch2 groups.	10.042383406020098
So , respective of which propagating species you have in the reaction medium , it is always the reaction with m 2 will be faster , and m 2 will more reactive than m .	10.221398014385976
Similarly , w 2 is the weight fraction for the component two , and t g 2 is the weight fraction for the second component.	8.637079272129933
Most important is using alkyl lithium.	9.451494698872061
So , there are many more examples , where the property of the polymers are enhanced by use of adding external additives.	9.047425864905481
In most biochemical reactions atp is the energy currency which is consumed and regenerated through catabolic processes and such reactions are classified under ligases.	10.15393374514137
Now , we have seen that x n of 100 corresponds to a p of 0.99 in one is to one case , one is to isometric ratio of the functional group.	7.933220033739728
At low ph , again similarly here it will have only one net positive charge , amino group will be ionized.	10.653866364610044
That is the example; cationic example just gave and which gives you a isotactic polymer.	9.170354690955167
So that is one feature.	7.864919979892324
So , if a talk about transfer reaction , that include the other reactions , which by which termination takes place , which are other rates , that transfer by the monomer rate of transfer , by initiated rate of transfer , by solvent or rate of transfer by the c t h , chain transfer.	9.669969138487334
Now , as i said that this will be definitely higher because you are talking about a gas phase reaction or gaseous molecules is converted to a solid whereas , this case it is all liquid monomer you are talking about.	7.6597272793777735
Again this terms are same , remember this t , this t g is are in kelvin.	10.635390297275446
And that is a semi empirical approach and this is the q e's q e scheme we are talking about.	9.09893202906838
As i mentioned earlier that a large number of enzymes that are known are mediated through co - enzymes or co - factors as you know and most of the applications that we talked earlier , they related to only hydrolytic enzymes which do not require co - factors with the sole exception of glucose isomerase which is an isomerase and it also does not require co - factor.	9.729325261186965
We are not considering for this kinetic expression , the other time transfer reaction , so we can write k t iz.	10.266848243762519
For example , if i take say consider maleic anhydride , we talked about that maleic anhydride or say stilbene.	7.70391285971893
A very simple example of this approach was reported by hicks and updike way back in 6.	12.608689550768837
So , that is too possible if you can add; if you think of adding another one , you can have another two possibilities and so.	9.874361008650988
Say for example , r 3 a l at high temperature high temperature plus high pressure , you only can got oligomers; so oligopoly ethylene or oligo ethylenes; the maximum molecular of , maximum m w of around five thousand.	10.364075282284462
So basically in this case , energy supplied is plotted against temperature.	8.386378704565285
There is no ideal immobilization method and each method has to be weighed in terms of its applicability and the parameters that are important are : method of preparation , binding force for example i have mentioned adsorption as a weak binding force as compared to covalent binding.	10.01293106641728
K * = [ ab * ] / [ a ] [ b ] [ ab * ] = k * [ a ] [ b ] ( 1 ) this chemical equilibrium follows the other relationships.	9.649197604818365
So , we know all this terms and we define a term called optical constant k as this to make this expression simpler.	8.424567388791301
The monomer solution which is usually water soluble is mixed with the enzyme solution and conditions are created so that polymerization can take place under mild reaction conditions with the help of a catalyst or initiator or some other conditions and the network of polymeric gel is formed which is water insoluble and then the enzyme is entrapped within the interstitial spaces.	9.422609409723876
Therefore small organic molecules or even metal ions provide electron acceptor or some other chemical potentialities in addition to proteins for catalytic function.	9.741319358441272
When the soluble enzyme is immobilized on to a matrix the interaction between the matrix and the enzyme amino acids might lead to certain conformational changes possibly due to the result of involvement of some of the amino acids residues in the immobilization process.	9.71222492197939
And i will be telling you what is my expectation at the end of this module.	8.708948182522661
That means these are the monomers.	8.955802782774969
That is you have to have one of the substrate in a very large excess concentration.	10.136418152283547
Sh + + e esh + e + ph + s in such a case although the analysis will remain the same only the form of the reaction velocity will change.	11.763930291318102
The voidage is almost approximating to that of cstr; not the same but it is approaching to that and therefore there is no pressure drop and the system has a very large voidage; the voidage increases.	11.87039470327507
K c by r theta is a function of both c and theta.	10.543184591355635
Many physical factors influence the adsorption process.	10.529880048231492
But the glucose concentration results in either production or consumption of oxygen as a result of the enzyme reaction and that is the purpose.	10.324458760003758
For example , if i take a example of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol , i have n molecules of this , n molecules of this which on polymerization gives you a polymers which is known as polyethylene terephthalate.	7.856115226049335
If we are talking about , say two homopolymer blend , so multiple t g , if they are visible , obviously single phase , and you have single t g.	8.807685408470526
We will just in a minute we deduce what the expression for viscosity average molecular weight.	7.635748979436764
Now , as we were discussing that in a normal chain polymerization process , as soon as the initiation reaction is slower , as we know initiation reaction is slower.	9.097561509103173
So , i can write m s u average is 172 by 2, is 8.	8.792473864273902
Similarly a number of other such therapeutic proteins or enzymes are available like asparaginase , for patients suffering from leukemia , which is again life saving.	11.514888212399887
And then we range or rank those polymers species , depending upon how long they burn and how they burn , and whether they ignite that cotton , which is present below the sample.	9.803054816617793
And you can end up getting new functional group or new products , which might give you color in the at the end of the reaction , so that is one example.	8.03173108876311
If suppose there is a unimolecular reaction one may say that there is hardly any advantage.	10.937008180829249
Of course the steady state hypothesis is valid.	7.188794186200412
Now this monomer , if i polymerize with a cationic initiator , then it will be a cationic species now.	10.649780380097601
The substrate concentration comes down to zero at this point and therefore all the enzyme present in this phase is not available and apparently it will look as if there is an enzyme activity loss.	10.763219532402303
And we have studied the molecular weight and we will continue from the molecular weight and move to the step growth polymerization mechanism in next class.	10.32485849566925
It is over all rate of reaction in terms of rate of product formation that indicates whether the enzyme is specific to a substrate or not.	10.355150518149026
Second disadvantage is that if the polymers are different in branching like different shapes like branching or other structural modification we cannot also get that difference captured in the calibration.	10.746485138946896
So these are the steps.	6.818106858283804
Similarly if you consider that the flow behavior is drastically non - ideal there is a full channeling; then corrections are to be applied to the design expression to get the reactor performance.	10.207435164745148
So , if you consider this segment , it has z minus 2 contacts with other than polymer.	7.562939718556547
That means the product may be one the substrates may be two.	7.758839781376002
And we now theoretically know that what once we do a polymer synthesis , what are the different types of molecular weight and what are the different types of molecular weight distribution we can get from our previous learning from last few lectures.	9.12295912904586
Now if you can form polymers having head to tail and head to head structure , then those will also give same molecular formula , but we know that we always get head to tail polymers in case of chain polymerization.	9.88351557885581
But , at this state there rate of rate of inhibition and rate of termination becomes 12 because the concentration of m dot is much lower it is about 10 to the power minus 8 moles per liter.	9.36972517119634
So , you take the monomer along with your initiator you add the preheated dispersing medium and then reversely start.	8.722101573734044
But in general you will notice that in the case of substrate dependent thermal deactivation the performance of pfr will be superior compared to a cstr.	8.194867019215675
A number of enzyme catalyzed reactions that are reversible in nature primarily can be affected strongly by the ph , particularly the reaction like oxidoreductases.	10.207435228214498
Example given is polystyrene and you know polymer made up of styrene and mma.	12.322849516428176
We all know what is a crystal.	13.678008793790534
In such cases you see the performance for cstr.	8.488882675516342
Now if you compare this to the trans arrangement.	7.5028359577537636
I hope you got it this are this line this solid line is this you join different binodal points obtains in different.	9.759815223996835
V m is the average molar volume of the polymer and the solvent.	8.916712623967193
On the basis of equilibrium kinetics one can write the rate expression of such a system as vi / vm = s km + s ( 1 + s / ks ) the vm is the true maximum reaction velocity if there was no such substrate inhibition to take place and km is , the classical ( k - 1 + k2 / k1 ) , the michaelis menten constant and ks is the dissociation constant of the second substrate binding.	7.611684042236656
If you compare between say propyne and acrylonitrile propyne and acrylonitrile , so if you c h 3 and c n.	9.067759640573685
So , the additives , which we are using , or you planned to use must survive those conditions themselves.	9.47529596107982
Means , where that , after the stress is released , it should come back to the original state that is , what mean by the reversible deformation.	9.722814146502222
For example take again the example of glucose isomerisation.	11.353794547005341
If you want your c d material to survive for ten years , then you must specify what is the temperature.	11.725514461457882
D ) 2 / 3 this is the.	15.104458456267604
The bond innovation will not be very hicks , so that you require a , much higher temperature , to break that homiletically.	12.26189844868362
So , do not crystallize.	10.074724736898162
If we look at enzymes as a polymer consisting of nineteen different amino acids with an average length , let us say 150 or 200 amino acids linked together.	10.038418256015703
In the case c , this is the performance with the perfect mixing.	9.732184839908461
On the basis of the same concept one can immobilize the enzymes on a support , insoluble support what we call as immobilize enzyme and use them for processes that can be used in continuous mode like any other chemical process , the term very commonly used in the chemical industry is heterogeneous catalysis.	9.760621379689336
Now , long branches can have further branch from itself , so it is a long chain branching with branches , long chain branches with branches or you have a linear chain branching here or you can have a network.	10.535737797690171
There are options where even soluble enzymes can be used in a continuous reactor but for practically most applications the use of soluble enzyme is usually with the batch reactors.	8.922511747716943
So in the case of d s c , the temperature between reference and the sample is kept constant , and the required energy is supplied , so delta e is the amount of energy required , to keep the temperature between the sample and the reference same , is plotted against t.	9.722447148714963
Now , so if i have plus these two reacts , n molecules of this and n combination of this , it will give you polyesters.	10.879976238198646
It is , as you can see , it is a radical process; now , to prevent these; so , if you want to design an anti oxidant , you basically have to attack or stop all this processes.	9.936392659396242
But what happen if you start with two different homopolymers and mix them.	10.736575659366125
And which is release of the article , polymer article form the mold , examples of improving hemocompatibility or biocompatibility of polymeric surface is a tegomer , which is and pdms.	11.1890931700816
Galactose oxidase is another enzyme which is known to catalyse the classical reaction of galactose to the corresponding aldehyde by oxygen.	11.250074512800897
And if you do not what are the monomers you should not use for branching and you should also know the utility , if you what sometimes it is undesired to have branching in the polymer.	9.908031713544416
And , the fraction of which , of the radicals generated during this initiation processes which start the initiation reaction is termed as initiator efficiency.	9.726601610384607
So the rate constant is dependent upon the equilibrium constant of the transition state process , the conversion of the a and b into the transition state complex and this also gives you a relationship between the rate constant and the k * , equilibrium constant of the formation of transition state complex.	9.078777383869202
Otherwise if it is very small they have a difference but if it is not very small the two are analogous.	13.336154728349422
Similarly , entropic change in melting processes , result in increasing in , mobility of the polymer chains , so at the entropic goes up.	8.52782698446122
So , these are the inorganic light stabilizer; they do not get used very frequently in applications , in real applications.	8.407526098239021
So , these are the examples by which you know , these are examples how you can utilize the anionic polymers and can make , functionalize and the , and polymers of having different geometallic mineral.	9.738738964928057
So , it is a inhibition reaction and this yb is a inhibitor if k z is little higher or may be comparable with k p , then are even part of the m n is under going this reaction and part of the m n is undergoing normal propagation reaction.	8.984176809328629
So , eventually or practically , a low to moderate polarity solvents like , say methylene chloride or say , methylene dichloride or thf , or ether or nitrobenzene.	10.088972007957388
We have to keep the reaction , or continue the reaction for a longer time to have the p value close to 1, which means , that if you have some monomer or the resulting polymer or oligomer are not thermally stable.	9.212887350077477
They are initiators; that means it is a free radical polymerization.	7.176795163075051
So , total number of initiator residues in the polymer sample is , n is the number of kinetic chain so each kinetic chain will have one initiator residues.	7.470205197599094
So that also dictates that there are certain reactions which are slow there are certain reactions which are very fast.	8.624876291058003
Free volume is the volume occupied by not occupied by the polymer.	9.33168350900534
This is a special case of chain transfer , where because of chain transfer , the molecular weight does not change but it results in branching of the linear polymers.	8.48785980947668
If the enzyme loading is constant , then the tau will also have the similar ratio because in our reactor performance equation the left hand side is k2e.	10.494632981210852
The cell membrane has still more specific functions and more elaborate functions but here the function is only based on the molecular weight cut off.	10.646479317714507
The as a result , the t g goes up.	6.044894944407696
And determines their molecular weight , their solution behavior , their morphology , their thermal behavior , whether they are crystalline or amorphous so that , all we we discused how to characterise polymer completely.	11.17347692118547
For example , if you take a butyl lithium in non - polar medium , you can actually aggregate , and , and that depends on which butyl lithium group you are taking and number vary from 4 to 6 or something.	8.555861444225016
So , you can now write; you can express this is in terms of molecular weight and then couple those two and write k is m to power a.	8.338556414568703
Now , this polymer , polyanisopropylaclamide , this is has a hydrophobic group.	10.394128383793726
So , if you have a straight line here , it will little curve below that , and is typically under estimates , is basically to be little , under estimates little bit about the t gs for the miscible blends , or the co polymer.	8.893753855010594
And , before we start kinetics of step group polymers , we define another term , or we talk about carother equation , which gives you the average degree of polymerization; sometimes written as dp , is a average of polymer , degrees of polymerization.	9.825668071195988
We will start in next class , continue the introduction and we start from the classification of polymers.	7.4658005175091775
So , they have a much higher reactivity towards a particular radical.	6.451291215622465
They are effectively slow.	8.558653055116627
That turn over number is very low and the rate of diffusion is very fast.	7.28495958966692
Total number of functional group , groups are how much , how many.	10.895702780958258
For example if i have; say y as a electron withdrawing group as nitron , so if consider a molecule like this , c n.	8.28556687167267
And rate of k , polymer , polymerization and because it is a bimolecular reaction , so we have m square , which gives us k c by k p 1 by m.	11.095389390823113
It will come out from the reaction and those will contribute to the lower molecular fraction , and to increase your poly dispersity , you cannot avoid the cyclic formation.	10.245219538578931
And this has been taken advantage to make a calibration curve where known standard very mono dispersed polymers sample which are very low poly dispersity like in this case four samples are shown here.	9.959838444067147
As a convention the quantity of enzyme which converts one micro mole of substrate into product per minute is termed as the rate.	8.404583114066506
So , and what is the molecular weight of the n group.	6.882897850816892
These are the four general features of properties one has to look in the carriers.	9.54169468996268
So if you have a sorted chain , then the polymer is effectively more flexible , t g goes t m goes down , and if you have a higher chain the contribution from the ends is less , so t m goes up.	8.00832164166413
Haze is defined as a percentage of the transmission light , which is passing through the specimen , deviates from the incident beam , by forward scattering.	10.796430993974722
Now , what , i will talk about that we talked about the effect of temperature , thermodynamics of polymer , different molecular weight distribution.	8.384196559320804
For step polymerization , this is very important because it will end up in most cases , pdi is .	13.847460226500889
We start with a monomer unit and only those cases where the polymerization can be carried out under mild reaction conditions in the presence of enzyme.	8.406350338434482
So , there is a m 1, m 2, or , because the system is large , and we know that it has been experimentary proof also that , the rates , rate constants become very , or becomes same as long as , as soon as they become this chain contain 2 to 3 monomers; as long as these chains are 2 to 3 monomers , the rates , all the rates become , all the rate constants become equal.	10.772708548747039
Because the binding sides are different and they don t interfere with each other but in the case of mixed inhibition , the magnitude of inhibition will be dependent on the ratio of dissociation constant for free enzyme and enzyme substrate complex with the inhibitor.	9.777547881301713
So , what about this regions then.	8.382043264928127
Now , let us talk about , we will not spend too much time on the effect of the pressure on the rate of polymerization and molecular weight because it is not very significant as i said.	9.029335719159993
So , this is the only one way you can place the solvent molecules.	4.983833184814363
Cyclic form means you will have inter conversions of the enzyme substrate complexes.	14.665041015199401
What if he used instead of ethylene , he has taken say alpha or say in this case propylene and used the same sort of catalyst; alkyl aluminum plus transition metal compounds.	11.25570231994296
Homochain polymers mean a polymer which has a backbone of only carbon ccc.	14.013169731454374
So , there is always a balance between what you need for the final applications.	6.783835649335754
A non - polar solvent will not really allow ionization to take place and therefore ph theoretically must not play any role.	10.10652708032079
That means the properties also will vary.	6.99402252897772
One of the basic assumptions here which we made is that the interaction factors , what i mentioned earlier as ks and a ks , the ratio alpha is very , very small than one.	9.397029620453582
In aqueous form titanium has five water molecules and one chloride.	10.734236961755323
By getting their individual rate constants you can also manipulate them for the design of reactors and for simulation work.	11.698436885830446
It depends upon the ion - pair and the solvent , on the polarity of the solvent , but to say , at least , that in polar solvent you have.	11.051092835237538
So , tg is not sufficient for practical point of view , you must know the softening temperature.	7.8644246861543206
The sign also indicates whether the enzyme substrate binding is exothermic or endothermic.	10.952672485228762
So these are some of the typical categories of inhibition pattern which are commonly noted and they have a key role to play in understanding the mechanism of variety of complex reactions particularly the bi - substrate reactions.	8.023853144454373
The enzyme binds to the substrate and then undergoes transition state and then forms the product.	8.06012350955706
Now , how does these numbers , del h and del s , vary with different monomer.	7.7733517366174585
Then we came to the effect of ph and effect of temperature.	8.362118740502549
Now , one different this ring opening polymerization with the normal chain polymerization , we know is that the rate constant for propagation is in its several order of maginitude lower than normal chain polymerization , it is actually of same order like in case of step growth polymerization.	9.9464756630933
So , we can ignore or remove this term monomer m we can just write q 1 and q .	8.23348729717038
That means the concentration difference; substrate concentration between the inlet and the outlet stream , the ratio of the two.	7.4102328359401035
A very accurate method which also has many other merits is in terms of lack of interference.	11.382402668958946
One thing you must be sure is that the rates on different substrates might be different.	10.188210448303622
That is what you see in a diagrammatic picture like here.	8.057721040748437
And which will i think as e 1 so similarly , we can write e p 2 e m 2 as e .	10.876018031655736
Now , if you look at the steps or the process of what happened when a polymeric surface , or any for the matter fact , any other external surface come in come in contact with biological fluid , the first step what happen , proteins present in the bio fluid , they get absorbed on the external surface.	9.194254635717842
This functional group has to be active or the reaction should be feasible under conditions which are mild in the sense that they are usually very close to the ambient conditions.	11.186581325025005
Starting from low molecular weight at the beginning to high molecular weights at the at the end the distribution goes up.	11.129286329166318
So , first and foremost criteria for scattering to happen , is that there should be a mismatch , or in homogenates in , homogenates in the refractive index , between the scatterer and the medium.	8.73380826287376
Now the feasibility of this monomers , to undergo polymerization , chain polymerization , by a radical or cation or a anion , would depend upon the reactivity of this double bond , and also the stability of the species which formed , due to reaction of this monomer , and the reactive species , r star which we talked about in the last page , which in turns depends upon , the inactive effect and the resonance resonating effect of this substituent group y.	9.546250894643393
Now if you have very narrow dispersed polymer , then you can consider m w or m n is same as m v.	8.488753246545778
If we consider the rate expression our classical rate expression v = k2e0s / km + s will apply to the situation.	8.563766113809567
So , we directly go to the scattering equation which based on the basic rayleigh equation for light scattering and then also from the fluctuation theory based on eintsein and smoluchowski.	9.877639086625864
But the effect of the fractional conversion on reactor productivity is just reverse because tau appears on the denominator , xs0 /.	10.301116818145022
Extrusion is basically a step where , a compounding is mixing is done between the polymer resin and other other additives or reinforcement colorant and all these things.	11.065661253842746
Now , if we talked about the other initiation process.	6.251722115568407
Let us consider the gel matrix and the enzyme entrapped in the lattices.	8.744504002898834
This plus basically , this , as i said , it can propagate from both the sides.	8.899587334859719
This is dead end.	8.174310869626527
It is purely a physical restriction constraint of the enzyme molecule within a narrow region of a space and therefore the enzyme does not undergo any deactivation and usually the yields obtained by the method are quite high.	9.342641638456866
But from the industrial point of view or from the application point of view another important type of classification which is made is in terms of three classes what we know as bulk , diagnostic and therapeutic.	10.918991060362748
So , let us now discuss the propagation step.	5.985664315872004
So finally , you will get these , you get these points.	10.65537165985609
Now , in this lecture we will start discussing about techniques which will enable us to get the number average molecular weight.	5.574361333045941
So , between this three processes thermal process redox process and photochemical processes.	8.771774489709088
There are many many phenolic anti oxidants available in the market.	6.967789544836044
It will depend upon the pka value of the two.	7.5883309860168815
Basically , these are not the polymers you want you want polymers which are as narrower as possible.	10.115264993101983
As a matter of fact that you need catalyst to accelerate the reaction , but you do not need in true sense , you do not need an external initiator like in the case of chain polymers.	8.247000046399554
For example , if we go back and look at this formula remember , we said that as long as this k and a are constant we can write log m instead of log size to construct this calibration curve.	8.345007647319276
If you remember , in this case using mono - functional group , the insert cap with non - functional group and when you use the other strategy , the type one where you have one of the groups excess is still has virtually date polymers , but there you have functional , same functional group present in both the sides.	9.226031098551006
So , what i will do; i will continue i will just take this , do one more step mathematical step for simplification.	8.82055446229822
And this first reaction are you know the has been taken that , this the fastness of these reactions has been taken.	11.343835051540784
One can develop on the basis of number of binding sites on the carrier molecule for enzyme.	8.706862012122897
Now , for calculating are defining haze , we will only considered forward scattered light flask , which deviates more than 2.5 degree , on average than the incident light beam.	10.285393243469077
In the case of histidine it is 5 - 6 and if you consider through amino group , the ph requirement is also 5 - .	11.276849360093637
Recall that in case of ideal solution , the molecules are having same size but in polymer obviously when you are dissolving a large polymer molecule in a solvent molecules , the size of polymer molecules are much higher than solvent molecules.	10.700038372535081
In the coming class i will start with classifications of polymer.	8.435083114439625
Now , i will come to the most important classification of polymers.	6.56911817788711
There might be some methods which may be carrier free.	8.734281860662184
A large number of other dyes also have been reported and this dye is only just to facilitate the measurement of the colour.	9.453524551104016
And the size in terms depends on the chain length of the molecular weight , as we have discussed earlier , chemical structure; chain stiffness the more higher the stiffness , the dimension of the size goes up.	8.9574032422764
All the chains are initiated , all the chains are initiated at a go , so this all starts together and all the initiator actually gets consumed before propagation reaction actually starts.	10.668892576711194
And to do that actually you need copolymers , co polymers of.	10.470564318793334
Very often we look at enzyme catalyzed reaction unknown to have an optimum ph and particularly in the case of immobilization by ionic binding it has been noted that there is an apparent shift in the optimum ph.	9.417583742259254
Inhibition by product is a very general feature for all enzyme catalyzed reactions but some enzyme reactions are also inhibited by substrate and this effect because the concentration profile of substrate and product in the two cases of pfr and cstr are different.	10.92519183270406
Now , this expression becomes not useful or become erratic when the size of the solute molecule grows.	8.072275248946319
If the size goes up , the entropy of mixing comes down.	6.721976246726086
It does not catalyze the reaction it will only remain as a ligand binding site.	9.119444009927227
Then the temperature of operation because deactivation also will depend on the operational temperature.	8.863098562725943
Their ionization doesn t really influence each other so much.	11.33242903390302
The selectivity is a function which is offered to it by enzyme because the enzyme has to be chosen which is highly selective for and that choice is important because if you are not able to choose very selective enzyme the analysis may not be very specific.	10.719014292810865
So , they they they resist times they resist to give a resistance to deformation , elasticity elastomer you know elastomers are very very elastic.	9.205156072725643
It will be only first term and the effect of operation stability is independent of the type of reactor.	9.39843190346319
It is logical that if this dissociation constant is low the substrate will have much more affinity for the second binding site.	8.59696981575558
The cyclodextrins are cyclic molecules with six , seven and eight glucose moieties coupled together in a starch.	10.159151516835621
So , basically , by using additives we can enhance or we can overcome the limited environmental stability of the polymers.	7.897391613934283
If c / c0 is one and from then onwards the input is same and the output stream theoretically after a time t it should also come out in a constant stream but it doesn t come out in constant stream.	10.225020907373901
And we will talk about kinetic chain length and molecular weight of the polymer produced in chain polymerization , in this case radical chain polymerization , and we will try , if time permits , we can or we will start the chain transfer.	9.91946164137468
Now i can rearrange it; because increasing viscosity is given by limits c tends to 0 eta s p by c which is basically given by n a eta s p by c which is you can write from here , you divide by c and you get this expression.	8.491604569471471
We are assuming that the substrate concentration is very low.	5.877352724099434
This is last and most important.	8.745745906225345
Besides the use of immobilized enzyme as industrial catalyst , the immobilized enzymes has a major role to play even for analytical devices and for therapeutic purposes.	10.53922092497221
So , this a for carbonate or any other polymer; this is for b b and this is for a b a b linkages.	9.44206612616674
So , if entropy of mixing entropy of mixing is negative enough then the polymers will make miscible blend and if there even 0 then aslo because of , slight entropy contribution , they may form misicible polymer blend.	9.884071870709693
So , they will start forming two phase system , because this is that is metastable , thermodynamically unstable; similarly , if you start from this temperature , this point , this composition then they will start precipitating this temperature.	9.092538674313785
We discusses that during the polymers there could be cyclic reaction formation or the side reaction for which small molecular weight generate which which result in higher p d ivalue of higher than .	11.247052732489555
Once the application of over polymers become a waste and its very important is as important as the earlier steps that we have a very good waste management system by which we can either , we use or recycle the polymers and if you cannot recycle or reuse the polymers then this waste of the polymer , the polymer waste has to be handled very carefully.	11.95462873299019
Now , by though they are very small they can resolved , and so they can be put in a scale , so from the enormous spectra we can get idea about the chemical environment of the of the proton here.	10.866899583235822
If you talk about polyester , we have this.	6.585545873698034
In those cases they produce lactose free milk by the action of beta galactosidase on milk which hydrolyses the lactose into galactose and glucose.	9.337889540017121
Similarly , in in adjacent to extrusion blow molding , injection blow molding also can be used where , this parison , this tubular profile is basically injected in this mold.	9.80094622358052
If you know these , this r you know and your reaction temperature you know , then you will get this value of the free monomer concentration at equilibrium.	8.471799113540563
The productivity will decrease; but even that is desirable to have a higher fractional conversion and a lower productivity.	11.693380112228741
But irreversible inhibitors cannot be removed once added to a reaction mixture and their effect is irreversible.	10.489313889528132
See in case of raft reaction , what is the molecular weight.	11.468432264845632
For example you take a permeable micro capsule in which the enzyme molecule can be entrapped such that the enzyme molecules cannot come out but the substrate or the product can freely diffuse in and out and such a system will also be called immobilized system.	9.835741417748126
Now , if you normal in the normal step polymerization reaction , because this goes through a thermodynamically control process.	9.068693126052434
Then the total enzyme concentration in the system.	5.997998650258579
Again a similar theory just like in the case of the modern rack hypothesis we assumed that the binding process induces distortion on the reaction bond.	9.810246030542983
So , you must there are agencies which give like astm and iso international standard organization or astm american in standard organization where basically , they give specific conditions , specific size of the and shape of the polymer specimen and the conditions.	10.15722911113499
To illustrate schematically the same concept of a biosensor i have taken here a substrate molecule to be analyzed in any given system.	10.154790185416488
So , in this case if the molecular weight of of each styrene , molecular styrene is m and you have a polymer with n number of repeat units same as structural units then molecular weight of this polymer would be m multiplied by n.	8.68909215012021
So , second segment can be placed in any of this z cells.	7.21054798903227
On the other hand the analogous relations in the case of non - competitive product inhibition where the reaction rate can be given by v = k2e0 [ 1 + km / s ] [ 1 + p / k'p ] the cstr reactor performance comes out at xs0 + km ( x / 1 - x ) + km / kp.1 - x / s0x2 + x2s20 / kp = k2e.	7.746676629295718
Now , we know that del v m is 0, so del h m will be given by q 1 .	8.710337860753585
So , that gives , 2 cancels out.	5.788576389984546
The same sort of catalyst was used by natta.	10.311849569579952
While sodium alginate is water soluble polymer , it can mix with the enzyme solution and then this mixture is extruded through a fine syringe into a calcium chloride solution and agitated.	11.56930145824094
Contamination is a very usual problem in continuous reactors and therefore you have a very fast decay.	16.598137613876393
But if anti - static additives surface - active anti - static additives are used then what happened the agent surface - active agent migrate to the surface.	8.802189767513438
In most cases this dissociation constant is different than the apparent michaelis menten constant unlike in the case of single substrate reaction where the two are almost identical.	8.834617602416625
That is if the enzyme undergoes a conformational change its specific activity will undergo a change.	8.50025534467752
As you notice here what ever i mentioned , it signifies the same thing.	8.64895689471544
We can trap this r dot; or , say , peroxide radical , and that is done by primary anti oxidant.	10.744795636064893
These distribution also can be used to determine the reactor performance based on the flow profile along with the reaction kinetics.	9.037134096460452
And of course , there is a very highly important you know the more importance given specially from the government side about the waste management of polymers specially recycling of polymers and find the ways where you can we use the polymers and of course , the there is a need for research how to properly manage the polymer waste.	10.59236325272445
This is all most all of them as formed belong chain polymers.	8.121704483212248
The third type of method is entrapment methods where the enzymes are entrapped within a matrix.	8.556898121757513
And , most cases are organometallic compounds; so organometallic compounds or hydride of a group one to three metal plus a halide or other compounds or other derivatives of group four to eight transition metals.	9.611881915920161
And we can use so many things and these mixtures take one from here and one from here and constitute the ziegler - natta initiators.	8.83562756604429
Now , in this is very rare.	7.50528581192797
So if you have a monomer like this , then it can be polymerized , by a cationic species , anionic; no it cannot be polymerized by , cannot be anionic species , because if you have a strong electron withdrawing group here , so anionic cannot be.	8.78510458197393
But , the drawback for these primary anti oxidants , that they form a very volatile low molecular rate phenolics.	10.058594524726075
And if they are terminated by disproportionation , then they will have 1 residue from the initiator molecules.	7.503316815034798
At the end of the immobilization enzyme preparation retention of catalytic activity is a major requirement.	6.981966510573725
These are the intra molecular reactions in the monomers of ab type.	9.403792230873908
If suppose the matrix is charged and the substrate is also charged and if the two species have opposite charges then the concentration of the substrate inside the enzyme particle we will more than that in the bulk and therefore the enzyme reaction rate within the matrix may be more than what is obtained at the matrix surface.	9.180005184396206
The lactic acid sample itself is mixed with nad solution and pyruvic acid is formed with reduced nad and reduced nad is then oxidized with a dye dpi and then the nad gets regenerated that means that is oxidized and reduced dye is colourless.	10.833254069613076
There mixing is not taking place.	9.493241210945943
So , total number of b groups will react also this.	6.856015764050432
So the product has to also transport and it might also undergo a kind of a gradient.	8.794409747357188
And we also said that if we increase the temperature , obviously the tendency for syndiotactic and isotactic will be significant.	8.45831620171634
For example , this is generic structure of the chain transfer agent , which could be water , alcohols , esters , acids or anhydride , etcetera.	9.79581644100515
And that has to become that negative , there must be a specific interaction like hydrogen bonding are pi pi or ionic interaction between the two polymer molecules.	9.561360215281118
There are also amorphous t g is very high and their continuous use temperature is 300 to 350 degree centigrade temperature.	9.173496556095154
The other noble modification of the plug flow system is a spiral membrane bound module.	9.938457849075947
As we saw here the substrate concentration goes down along the pores and substrate concentration going down means the react rate of reaction increases.	10.245472071011372
So , you can first stage you do a step polymerize to syntheses this and then you can take this and do a second step of chain polymerization either by oxidizing this or no using the other methods.	9.761294874553554
Any kinetic analysis should be made keeping in view the mechanistic hypothesis , the rate expression and the experimental data.	8.546683765278011
So the larger the molecule as the enzymes are it posses serious problem in the permeability and the most toughest biological membrane through which the drug has to permeate is brain membranes.	9.868726162497007
For example , polyethylene polypropylene , these are made of polymer.	8.768925120965397
When we talk of the immobilization for industrial reactors the major factor is the cost and in terms of the cost it is desirable that when we produce them on a commercial scale using microbial cells , those enzymes which are intercellular in nature they could be used almost in the form of . . . . ..	8.844788777508255
So , as a result what will have if you start each side 50 50 ratio of m 1 and m 2, you will get eco polymer at the beginning.	7.613588468687856
So , you are getting the polymer precipitate from your reaction mixture devoid of the small molecules.	6.445174115858817
I have listed some of them here.	9.625474765574294
In some cases the terminal carboxylic and amino groups are also involved whenever by tertiary folding they come in the proximity of the active site.	7.361405645261228
And non - bonding end to , and non - bonding pi star are very weak very weak absorption , which happens in this region 200 nanometer to 400 nanometer , which , so basically implies presence of nonbonding electron in the compound.	10.721283278079884
Rest of that twenty two lectures or twenty one lectures , we discussed how to synthesize polymers.	10.498243817670739
So , if you plot f 1 verses f 2, no matter what is the concentration of f 1, you always get fifty percent incorporation in the copolymerstion , this can be achieved , also if 1 of the monomer is , r 1 is zero , reactivity is zero , it could be rather way on , r 2 is , 1 is .	9.972828392920452
And we talked about; we are actually talking about different types of initiators , which can be used , or which are typically used in radical chain polymerization.	7.979733308499442
They are so many other applications , and for that it must have some properties , and foods especially , they has to be flexible , they mostly has to be transparent , and they also have a specific barrier properties.	10.504756323469199
So , the osmosis happens.	6.729311302569014
From the surface , the substrate has to move to the enzyme active site and the enzyme is distributed all over the particle.	9.57971233964752
Whatever mechanisms you can use to increase the frequency of collision , it could be the increase in reactant concentration , it could be temperature change , they will all result in increased reaction rate.	10.955375146632608
In specific cases they may be equal also.	10.608806475791411
Probably one of the simplest and the most commonly encountered pattern of reversible inhibition is what we know as competitive inhibition.	10.89464767327663
And b is the number average number of initiated residues per polymer chain at the end of the reaction.	7.995258846214125
You cannot determine m v for a unknown polymer by as such; you need to have a calibration curve and for doing calibration curve , you need to have 5, 6, 7, 8 known molecular weight narrow dispersed same polymer whose molecular weight you need to get it from the other absolute techniques like osmotic pressure or light scattering techniques.	10.430711889025988
In earlier case , there was no cross - linking possible between two linear chains , but in this case , because they are functional group , free functional group present , both types , it can undergo a cross - linking reaction.	9.635430073492396
We have not considered any of the mass transfer limitations or partitioning effect in the system and in the worst situation if you compare with the two major types of reactor systems , continuous flow reactor system , cstr and pfr we can analyze the reactor performance for a given reaction on the basis of the relative concentration of substrate to the km value of the reaction.	9.37541976509029
Polyamide; nylon 3, t g is 110 to 200 degree centigrade.	10.937519326028701
So , the v h is the volume of that sphere divide by total volume is the number of particle which is avogadro number multiplied by moles of polymer v h by total volume n a.	8.44506105176603
That is the conventional , internationally accepted unit of an enzyme activity.	8.265383922783517
Now , this 0.53 this 0.53, this 0.53 is from the 3 hydrogen , this 3 hydrogen of the polymer , poly butylacrolate blocks that corresponds to 3 hydrogen hydrogens from poly butylacrolate block.	9.557220840108235
The right hand side profile , a straight line profile refers to a thick particle where the thickness is high;.	11.56824064207483
So , you , you think , that whatever i am just talking is , is not correct or whatever is written in the book is not correct , you might think that way , but it is not you have to think little higher.	10.002977199666388
If you decrease the temperature , now whether that also simultaneously increases the rate of the polymerization that depends on the value of the activation energy for reactions.	9.93000109196342
H . if you put this equal to zero you get.	9.985702573398212
Alternatively some of the protein molecules which are known to be enzymes but may not be intrinsically catalytically active may require the role of an associated molecule what we term as cofactor for them to be catalytically active.	11.166831518910646
Now what we will do , elastic material will do; elastic material , all the stress by strain curve will look like.	8.827508016609887
So , we can write monomer concentration and the concentration of all the anionic , which is present in the reaction medium.	6.6517702614033745
These are very few lists of the trade names we are talking about.	7.799602894238794
These intermediate products are taken by the equipment manufacturer and by doing another processing step for example , injection molding they give the proper shape of the final applications where this polymer goes in.	11.331624640327624
In this case , you have 1 kinetic chain , intra molecular back biting you are resulting it , one kinetic chain so the number of chains in this case does not change.	10.112432376215704
So , it basically stops the fire and the fire comes down , it can also interfere , it can design additives , which interfere with the chemical reactions that maintain the fire.	10.279991740396767
So , you get this is specifically a plot of polymer phases with temperature changing and with different composition.	8.28023522458605
The temperature will influence the effect on k and the study of effect of temperature on the km is a very interesting issue because it gives you lot of insight into the thermodynamic aspects of the enzyme substrate binding like the enthalpic and entropic parameters involved.	10.862416734635753
We will have to understand its morphology , its physiology so as to be able to design an appropriate enzyme production system.	9.784438755767114
And many types of fillers mainly inorganic or added to polymers for different purposes and some of them are listed here.	9.370976324363362
So m 1, star can react with m 1, m 1 and m 2 are two monomers , produced m 1, m 1 star can react with m 2, m 2 to star can react with , m 1 react with.	9.750337051114574
Depending on the particle thickness , let us say diameter of the particle is dp the substrate might be able to reach only up to a part of the carrier.	11.627688996357639
That is what it means by effectiveness factor of one and in many cases of substrate inhibitor systems this is a usual pattern which is noticed.	9.893121921792181
Exp (.	15.253448221571698
That means that the dissociation of that , that is the break down of the ea complex is very , very slow.	8.243439305290083
You have a solution in this case polymer solution and the solvent for the solution separated by a membrane which is permeable only to the solvent not the solute.	11.636052408616044
Now , let us go to next topic which is branching and cross - linking.	6.588302081627497
Now , remember what are the other conditions we have assumed or imposed during the derivation of this expression was that there is one is to one stoichiometric composition of two monomers or two functional groups.	9.296057664705673
This a and b both have to colloid and make an unstable compound.	10.889548322527936
So , higher high elongation means toughness value is high so , these are different types of stress tensile possible for different polymers , the examples are given here.	9.309398733725335
Now , what are the , what does it mean by equal reactivity of functional group.	5.896391401555385
What happened in the dilute solution , now in dilute solution you have polymer there are not many polymer , when you have dilute polymer chain , i wrote this this two , because you are talking about pure amorphous polymer there is no solvent.	11.564536151422768
The difference between the ground state and the maximum level of energy at which the transition state is generated is called as energy of activation.	8.933544299799074
This surface , they have a thickness delta on the basis of the physical properties of the substrate molecule and the carrier particle.	8.526912406107822
They are depending upon the extent of crystalline and they can become translucent or opaque as well.	9.091275381850094
So , the original definition of addition and condition polymers are modified and now , the condensation polymers are polymers where you have a functional group like this z , where z could be any of this.	8.016558241450657
So , the application , the successful application of polymeric materials is substantially attributable to the incorporation of the additives into the virgin resin , we just produced from the reactor.	8.59056914608784
In this suspension case you have monomer soluble initiator; you have water soluble initiator , now apparently its looks that this is small difference , but this has very far reaching implications in terms of the mechanism and the kinetics of the polymerization process in emulsion.	10.176581294626747
Now , if we increase the molecular weight if we increase the molecular weight of the polymer what happen , this number of molecules comes down.	6.807310301546246
Now , we so far we discussed that , how we the chain dimensions which is basically you are talking about the radius of gyration , or rms end - to - end distance , where is we introduce the bond angle restriction , and the rotational restriction due to short range interactions.	7.681029329019129
So , as a polymer chemist the challenge , the current challenge is to make polymers , the good which have good properties for application to be able to find application how they are how they can be made form monomers , which are sourced from natural sources.	10.026537961486834
And then , this new monomer gets inserted in the titanium carbon bond.	6.156807585235829
So , if your eta value of the solution is twice 2x the eta 0 maximum , then you can find out that eta s p is linearly related with the concentration term.	8.593368265133103
Very often it has been noticed that a very common feature is that upon immobilization an enzyme may undergo some kind of unfolding; some kind of a stretching.	10.266419844016323
Similarly in the case of gelatin , one can mix the gelatin solution with the enzyme solution and pull it.	8.384866840431433
So , what happens.	3.707761474984944
The quaternary structure is only applicable if the enzyme protein consists of more than one chain.	9.216095239270267
It also involves involvement of a carrier matrix and sometimes these are known as carrier binding methods.	8.59266331654118
Now , first let us consider , consider the case of thermal initiation.	9.742872075558125
Another typical feature is that the kinetic parameters of the same enzyme which catalyses the same reaction from two different sources are different.	10.542323776385146
Once ei is formed it goes into an inactive first order irreversible step which inactivates the enzyme and the concentration of ei at any given time can be expressed as ei = ( e0 - ei ) . i / ki where ki is the dissociation constant for the inhibitor and then one can write the inactivation rate as vi = kin [ ei ] = kin e0 / 1 + ki / i therefore if i is in excess , if the magnitude of inhibitor is in excess , such that you can consider that there is a constant , then the whole expression is a first order rate constant that is kd . e0 where kd a first order rate constant assuming that i is in excess and can be considered as constant.	10.352832303870123
Most of the adsorption methods can be characterized by the classical adsorption isotherms.	10.417400098863757
So , it is very difficult.	3.6524278382909388
So , this is how you can carry out a there is a one example of forming bunch you know synthesis bunch polyester.	8.57305902151685
So , actually you have the end - to - end distance between in a polymer coil is always changing , so you have to get a time average end - to - end distance , we introduced the term root mean square end - to - end distance , which is given by this.	6.805936073561829
You can use the batch reactors also in case of repeated mode.	9.984342318011896
But in case of polymers , when you are cooling these trans , these polymer chains do not have enough space or they do not have enough time to sort of arrange themselves and align themselves , so that they make a crystal.	10.008955310144868
So kappa minus psi , we know.	11.577166478240716
Most enzymes will have certain hydrophobic patches on the surface which are required for many functional purposes because many of the interfacial actions will involve the hydrophobic patches on the surface and have an important role on the functional aspect.	10.976063094901559
So , what is the typical stress strain curve look like , we can analyze a stress strain curve so , stress is plotted against strain and these curves basically shows , what are the possible effect or possible deformation in a sample.	8.69988285736581
Like in the case of lipase or protease , water can be the second substrate or it could be the second substrate itself to yield the desired product.	9.733238508401877
Now let us start our very important discussion how to determine the molecular weight and at the beginning what i would like to do i will just give an overview of the techniques which are available and used to determine the molecular weight.	8.11224613231915
And then we introduced , we said that because the random coil is always fluctuating in because we have several conformation , numerous conformation the coil shape is always changing.	9.840419142873467
Another important parameter , or thermal behavior is , the maximum use , or continues use temperature , or it sometime called relative thermal index.	10.408694982164208
So the solution remains very dilute , then you can keep the expression for eta from the intercept and if you know k h , then you can get the expression; you can get the value of molecular weight directly.	10.506389247795097
So , this is what we get.	5.466062883212277
Now , for a flexible chain it can be statistically shown as this entropy for pore penetration given by this expression where a s is surface area of the pores per unit volume and l dash is the mean molecular projection which is basically given in to diameter for spherical polymer chain which is basically related to size of the polymer.	9.72874121675722
So , the molecular weight given is m v where m v is viscosity average molecular weight.	6.122751957596831
Just by observation of the variety of enzymes which have been studied so far , it is noted that only a few amino acids usually polar in nature they participate directly in catalysis - cystein , histidine , serine , aspartic acid , glutamic acid and lysine.	11.665586116587289
So , now if you want to calculate the number of ways all this chain can be placed; we have to multiply by the possibilities of each individual chain.	10.355298010965488
In one case a and b are present in a solution in which there is no catalyst.	12.432026153027635
The example we gave , most common propagation steps are in this page , what we just discussed now and as you can realize , that the rate of propagation will depend on the solvents.	11.225209474937575
So regenerability can be a very , very positive feature and in most cases that has been the key factor.	11.247686587946456
Now , what is the comparison.	6.752066314252314
So , these are the two main difference of a polymer solution than an ideal solution of the small molecules.	6.714351933539135
So , obviously if there is something present in the medium polymeric material which is scattering , and it typically scatter in all the direction , then amount of forwards scattering , the amount of lights which is scattered , is , and which deviates from the incident beam , by forward scattering is , what is haze.	10.180278912509719
If you want to prove in a reaction , if you promote the reaction , you know find out what is the size of this your polymer particles or so on , so i hope you understood this emulsion polymerization part.	9.842920345656422
As i said earlier , that there are numerous , numeron additives are added to increase the property , or they enhance the properties of polymers.	9.298265085744967
So , we will start from this point and talk about the dispersion polymerization and emulsion polymerization in the next lecture.	6.153737447371794
Oligomers are you know during the process of polymer synthesis , you get the small chain units which are consist of 2 monomers , 3 monomers , 4 monomers and so on , dimer , trimer , tetramers and these are called or termed as oligomers.	11.437248701042593
Now k d of this reaction is , at 60 degree centigrade.	8.78065826129224
So , in this case the reaction proceeds maintaining equilibrium between cyclic and linear polymerization.	5.834805529348086
Under these two boundary conditions you simplify and get an expression for s / ss and rearrange that in the form of thiele modulus.	9.591691812144107
Now , remember from our discussion in solution behavior of polymer molecules a polymer size which is basically hydrodynamic volume v h proportional to eta m.	10.00992352917198
Or in other words you consider two in graphical form.	7.1164096933583645
And , typically in a polymer formulation , more than one additives are used.	10.487639787067328
So therefore most of the enzyme reactions that require crude enzyme preparations where no degree of purifications is needed particularly in cases for food or beverage productions , the soluble enzymes are added and they carry out reactions and they go along with the product stream and the enzyme is not required to be separated.	10.758939782501932
This will be our course outline.	10.850975379867858
It is not always necessary that the binding site has to be exactly the same as that of substrate.	8.993503284029037
What you do , you dissolve take your monomer dissolve the initiator in the monomer and then on that you add your dispersing medium which is already heated in the temperature you want to do your reaction.	10.300174388430726
Catalyzed reaction will have a much higher reaction rate and so to really get the reaction at a high rate we want a larger concentration of eab *.	11.31499286627267
So , the chain grows in size , so it is very you know it is comparatively much easier to build molecular weight.	8.056635698249076
Now , if you do at 80 degree , then you can only reach polymerization.	7.488147440882998
And it seldom practice the in the increase in rate of polymerization can be achieved much easily then by increasing the temperature than increasing the pressure.	10.900519833517645
In most of these one of the reasons of activation is also.	10.222451766590515
So , if you want is medical equipment that typically sterilize by high energy radiation by like gamma rays , so these polymer polystyrene is in use.	8.46879789225882
We are writing any general addition of the next monomer , where p e is the polymer residue.	10.527483882466747
So , from that value you can exchange , distinguish between , or find out what is the contribution from the surface scattering , and balls scattering on the haze value.	8.749810010897738
So , i can name m; and also , we are drawing , write the summation of m i dot.	8.77589120242542
That means e upon e0 will be equal to k - 1.k3 + k - 1.k - 2 + k2.k3 e / e0 =.	9.038902020557886
As we have discussed , activation energy for radical reactions are much higher compared to the ionic group , ionic polymerization , which are very low and sometimes negative.	9.478302311966798
Now , because m itself is very insoluble , you know slightly soluble in water , so obviously the oligomeric radical will be even more insoluble in water.	9.34438062745714
And also , if this cyclics are present in the polymer mixture , they are sometimes very detrimental in the polymer property.	11.337817205372833
You must differentiate between the absolute cost and cost of the carrier per cycle.	10.547318634051653
That is a very typical feature of identifying a competitive inhibitor.	8.303121260425954
That can give you an indication of the controlling parameter.	8.396148208023119
So , he was carrying out a polymerization reaction of ethylene in presence of a alkyl aluminum , trialkyl aluminium and at high temperature and high pressure you only got oligomeric species , not a polymeric species.	9.772490416381551
The other factor which is important , which is probably attributing to this increase of adsorption with the increase in temperature is the diffusional processes because most of time we are talking about the carrier being a porous material and the ligands or the protein here have to diffuse into the surface , into the internal pore surface and the diffusion process gets increased by increase in temperature.	10.075339588038654
The polymer will try to maximize the number of polymer solvent contacts , which means it will try to expand the coil dimensions , so that you get maximum number of polymer solvent interaction , instead of solvent solvent interaction.	9.813786251940996
Radical polymerizations are not sensitive in general , but there are some polar monomers , which can be sensitive to solvent polarity , but in general radical , as long as the monomers are soluble in the solvent you are using , your reaction should proceed well.	10.215561168684943
This binding energy can be of the order of about 10 - 15 kcalmol - 1 at 25c and if you take the two reactants at one molar concentration , the computation will tell that it will be about 10 - 15 kcalmol - .	9.40689212409629
Now , let us consider a simple molecule; again same thing.	5.406669176546015
They are the ones which very heavily dictate the choice of the reactor; whether to go for a plug flow reactor or to go for a batch reactor or to go for a continuous stirred tank reactor are very heavily dictated by mass transfer requirements and reaction kinetics.	7.79075201587349
Then the sixth one is you make reverse micelle by use of surfactant.	10.120578426681565
So , if they can react inter molecularly and make a cyclic product , so if you talk about amino acid , it can form a cyclic product plus h 2 o.	9.039382614152478
These are the examples of big polymer industry where the the companies make the polymers in very large quantity , where the the applications where polymers find you know minor like examples i said where polymers are synthesized and added as a active or secondary ingredient in other formulations , those polymers are typically made by the smaller companies and they are taken , they are synthesized by the smaller companies.	10.310137700268605
Now , that is because you have large difference in size of a solvent molecule , and the polymer molecule , because the size difference you get this large increase in the viscosity of the solvent , and that increase the extent of increase by addition of a polymer molecule.	10.078424716740315
This means in the beginning of the reaction , if we stop the copolymerization reaction , at this lower say less than 5 percent conversion , and then you will get a copolymer , which is having a higher mole fraction of the m 1 unit in the copolymer compared to that is in the feed.	9.470960308699347
If you increase the time 4 times , the molecular weight also increases 4 times , in case of external catalyst.	7.925626616205589
The third role is in which the hydrogen ions play a role for either inhibitor or an activator.	10.00480197658001
Ks * multiplication of equilibrium constant of these stages should be equal.	11.245589023289092
In most methods we take either a prefabricated carrier or a carrier for conditioning either activation or some conditioning and couple that to the enzyme with a physico - chemical interaction.	10.13340506338885
This is a spinneret.	9.804997497543775
The testing itself is different modulus , we talk about the slow deformation that , we do deformation as we apply strain in a much slower rate compared to a impact testing.	10.845728800540625
So , it is approximately proportional to n into the power 1.	7.983590591651121
C is the concentration of the tracer which is in the output stream at any given time t and q is the total quantity of tracer that has been put in.	8.67066197336616
Now , as we said the least energy would preferred around dihedron angle 0 and or both the sides , so in that case you can , this term would be more than one , so this term due to bond rotational restriction will be higher than the term , which was for the other end - to - end distance , where it has only bond angle restrictions.	8.97793762685171
But in many countries the population is not able to assimilate lactose and it causes diarrhea and other kind of clinical symptoms and therefore people cannot take milk.	9.736299350086693
So , if you increase the molecular weight further , above this entanglement molecular weight; the viscosity goes up drastically , and the processing , these are processing become difficult and difficult more difficult.	9.137470816710461
Then fraction of conversion in the reactor which can be defined as ( s0 - s ) / s.	12.376577229660713
There are , this may be also known , but let me complete when you observe a nmr spectra , what does it mean the number of signals or peaks we see in nmr spectra , it means that is the number of equivalent groups of protons or carbon , if you are talking about carbon.	10.503324851291108
It is a consequence of a process.	8.614580759373412
So , this expression is known as mark - houwink equation.	6.802397557491394
Both reactions involve addition of water and ammonia respectively on to a carbon , carbon double bond and give you the corresponding products malic acid and aspartic acid.	10.641370333353102
What is the glassy state.	10.797470568706279
With this information that is available from the reaction mechanism then we will try to find out the fraction of each of the enzyme species of the total enzyme concentration in the form of the rate constant and the total enzyme concentration.	8.283637381138874
And any region any point here would be meta stable one so in single curve , single diagram you can get complete phase diagram , it basically gives you the phase diagram of that polymer in that solvent.	10.469251556923156
That means it is highly negatively charged and an enzyme molecule is entrapped or located in the midst of negative charges.	8.42573282867544
If you react with the cyanogen bromide , you get an imino carbonic acid and this imino carbonic acid then can react with the amino group of the enzyme , at ph 8 - 9 under alkaline conditions , to give - ch - o - conh - choh.	9.429300594618757
At time t , we have 6 moles initiator remaining , which means four moles have been consumed.	12.446972015284002
And generally , e r , the activation of is positive , small positive.	10.454093481008066
We will find out more about that in , little later.	8.419897651131091
Two major factors which contribute to reduction of the cost in immobilized processes are enzyme and labor.	11.09290724119504
And i talked about two options in a monomer , they can intramolecularly cyclize or in oligomer , they can , if their reactive functional group , they can cyclize as well.	11.3101141609805
And the intensity , and the coupling values we can get information about the polymer , and the functional groups.	10.153840031759925
Earlier was n b minus p n a.	10.607719700403095
So , in case of in case of a , say if you are having a 50 : 50 mixture of a and c , these are 2 monomer.	9.69375665094772
Another important group of adsorption methods is metal salt linkage.	8.298187667593066
We are able to know the specificity only while we determine the amount of product formed on a particular substrate.	9.90603610616889
Take the example of hydrolysis of an ester , a very common reaction even occurring in the case of enzymatic reaction.	9.580514548282105
So , n a will produce n a by two chains and rest ( 1 minus a ) , which is undergoing termination by disproportionation , they will form one minus a by n chain.	9.793032916427638
So , we plot a methyl methylacrylate polymerization at 50 degree centigrade in benzene by benzoquinone polyoxide initiator it is look like this time percentage conversion.	8.433645667811472
Therefore when you are going to loose almost fifty percent amino acid , in recovery process the cost is going to be double plus the cost involved in the purification itself.	11.006257816812703
Now , they are fact that this is the very first reaction.	9.540627052407512
As per the normal function of the enzyme the two carboxylic groups of the substrate are required to be bound to the enzyme molecule.	10.289801655759911
And they have aggregation numbers which means the number of surfactants per micelle is around 50 to 150, this numbers depends on the different kinds of surfactants.	12.550088102378183
So , we must push the conversion higher , so that the molecular weight we get is high enough for which will serve our purpose.	8.83479998933089
If you have radical , then it can react with a poly propylene to form , a initiating chain initiating species , which can react with other propylene monomer , and progress the chain or propagate the polymer chain , and this can be stabilized inductively by this.	9.748955707231612
So there should not be any problem , in that sense.	8.701155401242183
Thats the mass transfer coefficient.	10.624908400570487
But we are also aware of the some of recent developments in biotechnology , molecular biology and other sciences which involve isolation , purification , as well as stabilization.	10.34695848213045
Now will that be optically active.	10.02658560624648
There is no side group present , which basically does not restrict at all the rotation around the single bond which polyethylene chain is very flexible.	10.104525380799037
So , that gives our enthalpy of mixing.	5.641624160239817
Now , that gives , if you use the same thing you will find , that e r is coming around , whereas the values for k p and k t remains same means , the values for e t and e p remains same as the thermal initiation because they are the same reactions we are talking about.	10.176664405158228
So what , how do you make those polymers like if you feel disc , if you want to make a cd or dvd out of a polymeric material.	9.962059237795378
That mean the distances between these two turns is about 0.54 nm per turn 3.6 amino acid residues going to 0.5 and these dimensions have been extended over a large number of proteins and are found to be uniform.	10.813467681835034
This involves the use of semi conductor material showing a large resistance change with temperature.	10.476472179662176
That means as you increase the enzyme loading the reaction rate will also increase.	8.52485016957963
Here entrapment is solely as a result of insulation effect , the temperature gradient.	10.816631225451632
After that , we can make a interpenetrating network by dissolving one polymer in another monomer and then polymerizing the monomer to make a polymer , which will make this as a interpenetrating network.	11.978390890833493
So , we have come to the end of this module and what we will do now , i want to tell my expectation you know what are the learning objective in this module in the step growth polymerization; now what i expect from a student after going through this module.	8.466364820675121
Now , if you calculate the number for e x n , you get around 60, minus 60 kilo joule per mol inverse , mol inverse , per mol , which means , that degrees of , average degrees of polymerization or the molecular rate , will , will come down as we increase the temperature.	7.8508643549739805
In this case chloride; there , their interaction with the monomer; steric and electronic interaction with the monomer actually determines the orientation of the coordination monomers.	8.982570270054131
Chains topper molecules are molecules having mono functional group.	10.983411126792966
Now , we can consider two specific cases , where you have self catalyst; that means , you are not adding external catalyst , excess catalyst from outside; h is not , as said outside; the cooh groups present in the medium are acting as a catalyst; in that case , you can write this as k cooh square and concentration of oh.	10.353102753470116
So , you understand , if i have a poly - functional group , which have functionality more than 2, 3 or more , then there is a depending upon which reaction system , which are , we are talking about , if there is possibility that it form , it may form cross link.	10.290882601475094
This is the important mechanism.	7.7220153398271325
Typically we make concentrations 20 gram so that equations are valid.	10.318636648163647
Related to the same issue of multiple intermediate complexes is turn over number which may involve several individual rate constant.	11.452243508453487
So what are the types , we can what are the types of monomers , can be used for radical polymerizations , monomer containing double bond between carbon atom.	9.962145031007784
That means we have tried to explain with the two binding sites.	7.71818170848115
So , what do you think the samples ability to score in any subject , which depends upon knowledge , would change or not.	8.694355020713774
So , i have , hope you are convinced that polymers are you know a useful material and replacing the conventional materials.	7.895196527874374
Now if you have monomer like this , styrene.	8.114202183200664
To enhance the stability of the adsorbed material very often adsorption is combined with cross linking so that the cross linking is carried out in the presence of an adsorbate , a matrix on which adsorption can take place.	9.865044871961087
If it deviates and the . . . distribution or a residence time distribution is given in the form of . . . verses time distribution and one can say that if this is the total.	10.542786274242356
The molecule becomes so rigid that the structure is very rigid and deactivation is impossible.	10.694918798172031
The analogy is that the three expressions , the langmuir adsorption isotherm , the michaelis menten kinetics and mannose kinetics for cell growth they are analogues terms.	10.436716459885078
For example , blending with rubbers usually leads to decreased gloss values , in case of crystalline polymers like polyolefin.	9.482933206316982
So , the factor , the amount of monomer inside the micelle by the amount of monomer outside the micelle in aqueous solution are of this order 40, 5 and 2 this numbers is the ratio of the amount of monomer inside the micelle , and outside , outside means as a dissolved monomer.	8.216723407693825
That is one of the major advantage but the major disadvantage or drawback from the industrial application point of view is that the specificity requires a single enzyme to be produced for each reaction , as the engineer will appreciate that the benefits of scale of operation for the enzyme production is lost.	9.621297207918575
That means the age of various elements in a fluid stream from the reactor interms of age distribution that means what is the duration of the time which each element of the fluid has stayed in the reactor.	8.916764071038447
So that means it is active.	8.382349024014736
Or in other words in the case of substrate independent thermal deactivation the reverse is true.	6.842200222742523
That means the polymeric matrix is already functionalized and has a reactive functional group which under ambient conditions can react with the functional group of the enzyme protein and give you the product.	8.267487219510894
It carries out all functions of any chemical process plant that you have known or you can conceive.	12.504334870219438
You can get same number , if i consider how many number of , we have in the mixture.	8.850908770055542
This is a stable molecule which has much higher free energy change than the reactants and will break down to give the corresponding acid and the alcohol.	10.052003038625962
So , till now , we have been considering the termination of this propagating radical by bi molecular interaction between two propagating radical , either by coupling.	10.53909738594763
We started them in detail and once a polymerization is formed , we have learned how to characterise those polymer , both from a chemical point of view , chemical characterization.	11.066868186377542
So , at 61 degree or beyond 61 degree you cannot at all polymerize alpha methyl styrene.	7.662986841491181
So , this is the formulation and then , they are taken to melt processing steps like extrusion , it could be two step extrusion followed by molding or it can be just extrusion step.	9.434586503170417
Only adsorption part; desorption is not our interest where as in the case of chromatography both the parts are important.	9.857312228889182
Two major types of entrapments methods that have been extensively followed are by gel entrapment.	9.771840351019936
The magnitude at every step of reduction of energy of activation by 5kcal mol - 1 you will see that starting from 3.16 x 10 - 6 at a energy of activation of 5kcal mol - 1 you will go up to 1.33 x 10.	9.666760970733668
But still the technique is available and for some other application probably that method might become useful.	9.862089967720534
We will take those cases individually in subsequent classes.	8.67418757835619
We are talking of low substrate concentration.	5.8068258833923085
The first constraint is the detection of the product.	6.879426749119701
So , is basically the choice of fire additives will depend upon the prior of the polymer and the additives , basically one additive may be very good for one polymer , but the same additive may not be as good as for the other polymers.	11.05143104834387
For a small expansion this can be shown theoretically that a the expansion factor for end - to - end distance higher than , expansion factor for radius of gyration.	8.513005949408935
So , molecular weight is m; in this case molecular weight also m.	11.594722845744755
So , we know this now from the experiment and we can find out the concentration of aim as well , so this k p and m dot are the two unknown quantities.	10.21929633675369
Move to the next one which is cross link polyester in this case one example can be taken is a maleic anhydride reaction with ethylene glycol; and once it forms the polymerization is complete at the end you have a double bond in the polyester back bone.	12.467251739377861
You can do yourself; plus 0.5 m r and r as r r plus 0.5 m r.	8.738233106495588
That is usually the pattern if the reaction is irreversible practically irreversible.	9.928433956949046
At any other v value of b the rate profile will be a hyperbolic profile analogous to that of michaelis menten constant.	9.000562794499979
The scale up systems is more empirical compared to cstr and pfr which are considered to be idealized reactor systems because in terms of fluid flow behavior they represent the two extremes.	10.934057931293632
That means to start with the substrate molecule can hook up to any of them irrespective of the choice but after it gets bound it makes a conformational change on the enzyme molecule.	8.717617088455086
In fact some of the unusual reactor configurations which have been proposed to catalyze to be used for carrying out enzyme catalyzed reaction like hollow fiber reactors also arbitrarily fall into one of those categories of plug flow or cstr which were discussed.	10.410957135949419
So , if if only transfer possible to monomer , then you can write x n bar is plus c m.	8.683588378457808
If you have a , if you , if you have a reaction mixture , and if you can partition or you can cover some part with a opaque , opaque material , then the part which is exposed to the photons or light , that part will get polymerization.	9.832974028711572
The reaction , the polymers made at the begin will be lower molecular weight comparatively lower molecular weight.	9.704922381132624
In this case you indentify in the polymer structure in which class it belongs for example , whether this belongs to a ester class or a carbonate or a amide or urethane.	10.64390014921728
So , if we have a vinyl acetate radical in the reaction medium , then it will always copolymerize.	7.059070425263556
But as we know , that small molecular weight effects m n more , that means , the percentage of drop in m n is more than percentage domain m n and m w.	8.921059964609007
It , the activation general propagation will of course , depends on the initiator or coinitiator and the solvent.	10.07966740257575
This is the number of cells which are vacant , because n 0 was total number of cells and i x is the total number of cells that are already occupied.	7.565661065038375
In that case to bring , to introduce that required property , we must mix this homo polymers with another homopolymer to get the properties , good properties of both the polymers , or we need to synthesis a new copolymer.	10.92176851725439
You cannot produce them in very large quantity because you require small quantities of catalyst for specific reactions.	9.619960948891528
Now , the nature of the additives we must use or we use , must be depended on several parameter; for example , composition on the polymer.	9.214019231724485
As i was just mentioning that once we made this polymer , we must characterize both chemically and physically and one of the most important parameter is the molecular weight.	8.335349571382507
So , for that you require very strong acids so that the necleophillicity of the counter ion will not be enough to compete with the addition of monomer or the reaction of monomer with the oxonium ion.	10.748433894897612
Because , the number of micelles are much more huge compared to the monomer droplets , obviously even though the sizes of the micelles are smaller than the monomer droplets , the total surface area or the micelles are considerably higher compared to the total surface area of the monomer droplets.	8.842685727843024
So , let us take a example i have say 50, say 2.	7.8350799078441415
You can also look at these expressions in a graphical mode and to have a better visualization.	11.21000086636266
The basic concept in a living cell , when it comes to cofactor linked enzymes , relates to cycling of the cofactor between two enzyme catalyzed reactions.	8.286671696417446
What is immobilization.	10.033963083459634
So , there will be a drop in intensity , when light pass through the matter , due to surface scattering reflection , and bulk extension.	9.140479634135367
So , the real polymers would be in the smallest number present in the reaction medium in case of numbers , but the numbers are not always very significant.	10.286514553844434
Particularly the enzyme which was mixed with the hydrophilic monomer is entrapped within the microcapsule.	12.269206753900425
I mean by successful , i mean a building of the molecular weight of the polymer , which is targeted and in most cases it is a high molecular weight polymers.	7.994811720978045
And a student should know the condition and you know what are the what are the conditions you know what are the monomers to be used if you what a branching or cross linking.	10.063348860095644
So , you have total number of 50 students , in the 5 bench.	9.7317641219102
So , i can write individual molecules by total weight.	6.103886018384764
Most of the polymerization happens inside this surfactant micelles , now what happened once the polymer on the propagating radical or the primary radical gets into this micellar core , they will start the polymerization reaction.	9.830785841769368
We started , say , with t initial which is the thermostated the temperature for the thermostated chamber which is filled up with solvent vapor and we add one drop of solution in one thermsitor and one drop of solvent in the other thermistor.	11.099416514817571
So , of the process we discussed emulsion polymerization is of great importance industrially , you should remember that.	9.195747188465477
So , they give actually less free volume to the polymer chain and also they may contribute little bit about the restriction chain rotation.	9.314561929603121
How do you determine this molecular weight.	6.626731347503446
If there is a orientation , the chains if the chains are already oriented little bit obviously , if you want to deform further , you have to you have to stretch the polymer chains further.	11.14929908369791
How this k and h2 is related.	11.321994307811002
And the second was that you can add a mono - functional monomer in slight amount by , then by doing this you can control the molecular weight.	7.753548855559441
And the first derivative will vary discontinuously , whereas in case of second order transition , the second derivative of the gibbs free energy function varies discontinuously.	8.839733557452776
It operates almost like a packed bed system.	9.664893852845871
So , the end to end distance , which was earlier this , now it will become this.	7.66512701288362
Then you will always land up in a completely random copolymer , you understand why , because this reaction when they are happening there is slow reaction.	10.213592452248575
Look at these are mainly inorganic material because inorganic material , they do not basically burn in those temperature.	9.715599803280515
Now , this assumption is a shear assumption , and it has been proven experimentally.	9.687497197988197
So , the rate of polymerization inside one particle , one polymer particle is given by we know the expression , k p m p where this is the monomer concentration inside one particle , and the radical concentration which is given by this that is from our knowledge.	10.524628546227875
On the other extreme if you go to the concentration beyond this point when substrate concentration is much , much greater than km v0 = k2 [ e0 ] ~ vm which means a zero order kinetics.	7.210967606383379
The initiator which is best , or which can polymerize a monomer , containing a double bond , will depend upon the monomer structure.	10.420641296340198
So , if this is the duration of p which means at lower , this is the lowest p , this is the intermediate p and this is the highest p which means that at the lowest p , your polymer mixture has maximum number of molecules having low x.	10.363435498447341
Similarly it should not react with the chemical you are bringing in contact with.	11.44333769826138
Now , we will discuss more on the mechanistic part in a minute , and then we will understand this point , with little more clarity.	9.778469889461888
Once you induce cross linking into it by any method , it could be by a cross linking bifunctional reagent like butyraldehyde , it could be ferric chloride.	9.828848924541726
So if you plot the same graph , like we did for d s c , we get it deep at t g glass transaction temperature , and melting t you get exo peak , so this is t g and t m.	8.245938719136
The immobilized enzymes experience in addition to the catalytic activity three major external effects during immobilization.	9.040475246180012
So , what we going to do in the next lecture is we what to find out the effect of temperature in the polymerization rate.	7.0304235055181366
So , at the one more time , at the end of stage i you have large monomer droplets stabilized by the absorption of surfactant molecules of course , the this size has sunk from the beginning , you have the initiator molecules still present in the in the solution , you have monomer molecules as well.	9.208289845797244
Particle shape and size will control the voidage in the packed bed but when you move ahead from the plug flow behavior and continue to increase feed velocity stream to a level that the bed is packed , bed is disturbed.	10.649176156065307
So , once initiation propagation is done , let us just glance through the possible mechanism by which we can terminate.	10.57366760891038
This lewis acidity of this defined metals increases with the atomic numbers.	10.866135312012789
You take ethanol water mixture put the enzyme carry out the reactions.	9.43418750317212
So , let us continue with the next page which means x n.	7.104893963451285
This is one example of the difficulties if you have higher molecular weight than the targeted one.	8.93248685428821
In the case of non - competitive inhibition whatever be the concentration of substrate , it does not influence the degree of inhibition and it is totally dependent on the concentration of inhibitor and the ki.	8.357767605232613
The conversion of the rate constant or interpreting each of these steps in terms of first order rate constant term is called kappa.	10.777512828258743
Now we will give specific examples of determination of end group by spectroscopic method when we discuss the spectroscopy method of polymer characterization in the next or two lectures from now onwards , when we give specific examples of how to determine polymer number average molecular weight by end group determinations spectroscopically.	9.85154009279043
So , they will be a phase difference and as a result they will be decreased in the intensity.	8.521833572630834
What happens.	7.344844585874543
The polymers having unsaturations , the silver cation can be used; it can actually complex with the pi bond; for example , polystyrene , polybutadiene this polymer cation can be used.	10.504205781685615
As you can see , hydride elimination is always slow and if you compare with a cationic polymerization we talked about , in that case it was actually proton elimination , which was much , comparably much easier things to happen.	9.42817113038842
If you consider this function f that is tanh.	8.00084856095038
This conversion verses time gives you rate of polymerization if you do it at a 10 percent concentration then the rate goes down slowly , but no gel effect happen if does in happen for 40 percent as well.	9.844644647097665
This is r 1 greater than 1, r 2 less than .	6.558455376540263
Now , generally anionic surfactants are used for emulsion polymerization , and typically these are salts of fatty acids , salt of salts of fatty acids , like sodium or potassium salts of palmitic or stearate or laurateo or it has sulfates like sodium lauryl sulphates or sodium dodecyl sulfate or sulfonate , like sodium benzene , benzene sulfonate.	9.972067794425817
Very often even after the immobilized enzyme preparation has been exhausted during use the carrier can be recovered and reused.	9.355353720703219
The example of the glucose isomerase is a typical example which has used such a phenomenon.	11.536508760161242
We are convinced that in for polymer chemistry , this life is little difficult compared to organic chemistry.	9.586845563067385
There is large variation and therefore the relative proportion of these amino acids also influence the properties of the consequent macromolecule what we know as proteins.	9.771215589425132
That means the rate of reaction is much slower than the rate of diffusion.	6.54749153771563
So , obviously , if we talk about say for example , take a case of pmma poly methane methylculate , which as ri 1.49, then percentage t maximum.	10.08249502548503
M w by m n , now this remains very narrow , say , less than 1.05, something like that.	9.925502229940749
So , third category could be semi - synthetic polymers , where chemically , which is chemically modified natural polymer.	10.458440840896472
And which you can go through any text book or any standard publications to find out , if you are interested how they are synthesized and what are their property you know basic property.	11.468830232977025
So , we must know before going to further , to do know the property or to determine the property of these polymers which we made , you must know what is actually the chemical structure of the polymers.	8.224412089800648
These are the types you can use here , and you can type here , but the general reaction is same , and the reaction is much faster , and it can be done at room temperature , or even at lower temperature 0 to 5 degree centigrade , or something.	11.122978434984557
So , from there we can write that.	7.862332828152168
So exactly the same concept may not be applied , but still one needs to retain the co - enzyme so that it is not consumed during the reaction.	10.782217259638523
So , you get a flexible a chain and in most cases we highly coiled these are coiled structure.	7.89898739055924
Glucose will get oxidized and the corresponding electron acceptor will get reduced and one can carry out a number of organic chemical transformations.	11.94068821444954
Although care need to be taken in covalent binding to ensure that the amino acid residues that are involved in the catalytic function are not involved in the covalent bond formation but still the reagents are not very specific.	9.362434312739436
Now how do you synthesize; what are the ways you can synthesize , what are the strategies you can take to synthesize one particular stereo regular polymer like isotactic polymers or syndiotactic polymers.	10.107666880849099
Another factor is the blank portion; the cost of the carrier which is an additional input in the case of immobilized enzyme which does not exist in the case of soluble enzyme.	8.778756196976149
Then this a block would be 25 percent , b b block would be 25 percent , and this alternating a b clock will be 50 percent.	9.322613412369073
The equilibrium constant can be monitored experimentally and that can also give you an idea of measuring or determining the individual kinetic parameters experimentally.	10.524604960388563
S / k m + s the role of an activator works out to modify the intrinsic km value of an enzyme and the effect on the km value will influence the rate of the reaction.	9.453986210542867
So , we require stabilization to have this polymers apply , applicable in the applications , where they are currently used.	8.038990693306106
A polymer form from 3 methyl 1 pentene because these are substituent s.	10.612309339335999
So , you cannot only consider unit volume , you need to consider the volume element at distance r from , say you are not considering one point , you are considering the entire volume element which is having distance r from the origin where you find the probability of ending the other chain end.	9.436671538082503
One is the conformational changes as a result of which the basic turn over number of the enzyme might be altered; even the value of michaelis menten constant may also be altered.	11.186320872033342
This is the proposed mechanism for styrene and it is initiated in troop.	10.9701663493595
This is fringed micelle model , which is like these crystalline domains are micelle like structures.	10.517401661216624
So , you will see that del s value is more or less more or less same for most of the monomers.	7.0415447087781216
In case of radical it has said that at several combination of monomer possible , because we know that most of the monomers we have seen during our discussion , initial discussion in chain polymerization that , most of the vinyl monomers , they do undergo radical polymerization.	9.40992425331189
Under that condition the accumulation term will tend to be zero because whatever material is coming in , either it is getting converted to do reaction or it is going out of the reactor.	9.641049375053923
Therefore such an analysis can give you an indication but may not be able to give you confirmed data.	10.429433903191395
Again there will be a difference in the km value you will again get an apparent km.	9.724483789294698
So , always avoid in this type of solvent for alginated only in that sense because alginated solvent will always breezily it can be easily acceptable.	10.506021442511894
What are the process conditions required for a successful step polymerization.	8.953823174882583
We also know that the p theta value or p theta expression which we just showed it is for gaussian coil or random coil which typically polymers are in common solvent , but if you anticipate that your polymers are stiff rod like or a very hard sphere like then you need to use the different expression for p theta and there should not be any aggregate formation even though using a very dilute solution you should make sure that especially this is very important for proteins and the other bio moleculars that no aggregation takes place.	9.627970794467027
Ultimately at the beginning even if they are making blocky copolymers at the end by doing reshuffling finally , you would land up in a random copolymer.	10.527761453122356
Typically , all time in normal reaction , we write a single arrow which means any reversible reaction.	9.865066824718932
Welcome back to this 15th lecture of the polymer chemistry course.	8.88837673497899
So , equilibrium equilibration time must be short which can be done either by small cell volume or by high membrane surface area.	9.590777204526933
For example , if i look the values for one butane thiol this number is very high , because in this case this is a very week bound.	9.480500217488961
For example , you take specific example of amines , they can react with this propagating species and form a complex , such in this case this cationic species is very stable and they are nonreactive towards the monomer.	10.374223115688007
So , form there a branching can happen so this are the side reactions where chain transfer takes place intra molecularly with in the chain form a ring structure and another linear molecule.	10.06957835158924
Let us assume that , two moles of this , become dead or on the weight termination reaction by disproportionation reaction.	8.735140426390283
There might be very small applications here and there where immobilized enzymes might find useful applications.	9.432771471584603
It is reversible inhibition which forms the major portion of the effector molecules that are of industrial , medical or biological value in the case of understanding the scientific basis of enzymatic catalysis.	9.789579177431804
You know how the rubber works.	10.370707452576537
But we have just put the different rate constants.	9.445661651536877
And as you can understand that the , polarity of the solvent in which you are doing the reaction , and that will effect more when you have a ionic chain co polymerization , compare to when you have a radical chain co polymerization.	9.796955853772344
Once the method of immobilization is fixed , the immobilized preparation is fixed the value of p is fixed.	9.398061102517412
This residence time distribution experimentally for a given reactor system can give you an idea about the nature of non - ideality of a reactor system in terms of flow behavior.	10.12380811416611
This alkyl halide could be , say for example , r could be tertiary carbon or could be a triphenyl carbon group.	10.887441263356033
So what we are doing , we breaking or dividing the polymer molecule in to x segments; dividing a single polymer molecule in to x segments where the size of the each segment is same as the size of a solvent molecule.	7.759017220997882
With that concept he was able to determine the dissociation constant of enzyme substrate complex formation.	8.135639238362678
Whereas for control purposes it will require a very small concentration change by which the reaction velocity can be regulated and that is what can happen in the case of a sigmoidal kinetics.	10.21005913146454
Also we assume that whether the enzyme substrate complex bind to inhibitor or the free enzyme binds to the inhibitor the dissociation constant is identical ki.	10.297765756202788
Now , first define what is conversion in a polymerization process.	9.46498868852428
For example , if we take this electron transfer for initiation reaction of styrene.	6.7672140976038015
At the very beginning itself , the polymers , large polymer chains are forming and as time goes , the conversion happens.	9.839732246655869
So there are two extreme cases where effectiveness factor show discrepancy from the theoretical understanding.	9.671478628424074
Now in this case unlike polypropylene or other the carbon - carbon chain polymers , if you consider these carbon which is asymmetric in nature , then in this case , this two polymer residues; in this case , this one and this one , they are actually different in nature.	9.780282545912982
So , if you want to avoid this drift in copolymer composition , you should be restricting your copolymerization reaction to very lower level of conversion , so that the feed ratio the monomer ratio in the reaction medium does not alter too much compared to the feed ratio.	9.660580901769645
We had p m 0 by i .	10.77558897166638
When a solid particle is immersed into a liquid phase there is also bound to be a stationary film of liquid around the particle.	9.554546646530415
Obviously , if you have cool the polymer melt slowly then , the crystal , the polymers gets , polymers chains gets more time , and they can crystallize , and the crystallize crystallization take place easily , or the crystallize can grow in bigger size.	11.44945951188808
In some of the cases the steric hindrances can be minimized by introduction of the spacer arm.	9.971895157148285
Now , the chart of the thermodynamic feasibility what we shown that was for ring cyclo alkenes not this type of monomers , where you have a hetero atom.	9.785108677714213
Immobilized processes are more favorable if let us say the enzyme cost is not very high this is not going to make a dent on your process.	11.320504876688707
So , if we use some additives , which do not survive the condition of the processing of the polymer , which you are interested.	9.795234164888479
Now , i consider tri ethyl amine as a solvent now it is electron reach , so electron and c c l 4 which is electron acceptor solvent.	9.064879751292278
Depending upon the further application it may be deionized and other operations may be done , concentrated and you can collect the product and this was the system which was reported for glucoamylase immobilized on deae cellulose by ionic binding.	10.655469287985168
So , basically you must know that , the mechanical properties of polymers this for examples stress strain curve and other mechanical properties always as well , very much depended on the temperature of the experiments.	9.074579043124878
We can classify polymers as a chain configuration.	9.384551595309034
Now , what does it mean.	3.541862716254567
What is size.	10.033963083459634
Today we will like to look as at how this deviation in the ideal flow behavior influences the reactor performance.	8.652935525326598
Because one would like to look at a particular bio transformation but if the enzyme is not available in bulk quantity at a low cost the application may be inhibitory; may not be feasible.	10.33725702754547
In the same reactor system if you use ethanol , polyacrylamide hydrazide coupled nad and peroxidase you can get a net conversion oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and the profiles shown here give you the kind of reaction progress.	11.085040812977624
So , if you look tri ethyl amine the value is higher for acrylonitrile than vinyl acetate.	7.393161771376968
You have to give another shot to keep the enzyme activity available in the blood stream.	9.678205848814601
Corn as the starting material; corn is hydrolyzed to produce glucose , corn . . . starch or starch to glucose and glucose isomerisation to fructose and an equimolar mixture of glucose and fructose but in india a good quality corn meant for this purpose what we call as sweet corn is usually not available since the relative cost of the corn is also high in india , being the staple food.	10.826488104004035
We can just simply write d ln r p by dt is plus e r by rt square.	9.369864387334077
So , how these polymers are getting formed.	8.849612228456413
You know what happened in membrane osmometry.	11.720096169114617
When we talked about adsorption we mentioned that adsorption being a reversible process , the immobilized enzyme preparations that are produced by adsorption usually do not have very high or long operational stability.	10.05714193322429
So , this is mathematically we can do and this wet fraction distribution can be expressed by this formula where this is the detector signal at v e , and this is molecular weight which we got from the calibration curve for this particular v e , and s v e is the magnitude of the slope for this log m versus elution curve plot for that particular point v e.	9.44805064972
Similarly we can write other structural or constitutional isomers like we can write polyvinyl acetate which is having structure.	11.77536277550374
Now , if you , if the polymer present in a concentrated solution then one polymer will come close to another polymer molecules.	8.175591170476117
So in summary if we know this mark - houwink equation where m v expression we just have seen.	10.199846189026871
And this is the micro structure actually determines the material property.	9.55367223745584
But in the case of immobilized enzyme you can repeatedly terminate by physically separating it.	7.236100384262384
So we need to predict , in order to predict the copolymerization composition , what we need to do , we need to construct a kinetic model and the simplest is the terminal model.	10.02925842878404
In the case of living cells the intercellular concentration of substrate does not change over a very large range.	8.546827156475121
At the beginning you will get a copolymer , which will have m 1 greater than 50 percent , and m 2 less than 50 percent , this is in the copolymer , at the beginning.	9.476354632388706
So , you with time , what is the average.	8.673057628199542
So basically that tells you , that the number of options in copolymer , if number of co polymers can be synthesis is unlimited.	11.906678316855077
So , m is also taken out.	6.679408426713986
And we also see whether the molecular rate of the material has changed , by the applying the coming in contact with chemical agent , which can be done by the measuring the viscosity of material.	9.698551573687471
Today we will move to a different topic , which is structural analysis of polymers by spectroscopic method.	10.177650525698393
Then the temperature of operation , ph control and these are the reaction conditions.	9.126002819671085
So , what is the rate of this termination step.	6.86033054288834
Finally i would like you to leave with a small exercise.	11.829761673314751
So , 1.02 to 1.1 1.2 something like this.	6.602998149844811
This is emulsified in a water immiscible organic solvent which is cyclohexane , chloroform mixture.	9.360968262759505
When we used the michaelis menten equation you will recall that we had made certain assumptions and the assumptions were that we are talking of the initial reaction rate.	7.458187866301564
And , additives are also added to import new and enhanced properties like , in the polymer like , fire resistants , static dissipation , improvement in mechanical properties , to compatibilize blends and so on.	9.3023764002835
Now , let us talk about thermodynamics of , of radical polymerization.	4.694832899129673
On the other hand you also have a very clear understanding of the genetic machinery of the cell , the microbial cell that controls the enzyme synthesis , which you will manipulate leading to hyper production of the enzyme.	8.658233701020608
But even a smaller level of heat generated can be taken care very easily in case of fluidized bed reactors.	10.052866749463028
But there are some polar monomers , like methyl methaculate or methyl vinyl ketone , which can undergo side reaction , which actually restrict the molecular build up.	8.553048402332102
And when they are added this nano - fillers are added to the polymer formulation , the resulting formulation or resulting polymers are called nanocomposites.	10.455614015836181
The yields are also much lower particularly for porous carrier because of the diffusional limitations.	10.43932881801717
Consider two routes.	11.315532915669753
So , you do not need make a effort to maintain the stoichiometry of the two monomers close to one is to one.	6.391407248473101
In the case of un - competitive inhibitor the degree of inhibition is s . i / ki ( km + s ).	7.809554761361857
To summarize what we have done as far as the idealized reactor systems are concerned we have originally defined our idealized reactor systems which means that we are considering the extreme fluid dynamic regimes; back mix and plug flow.	10.491128288308547
In many cases the altered optimum ph will result only on the basis of the nature of the carrier you are using.	7.57578237095025
Now , as you can think that this volume exclusion would be , volume expansion would be expansion or the volume exclusion would be higher , wherever the polymer chain density is much more , because if the polymer chain density is more than the chances of that two segments , or two bonds trying to occupy the same space is high.	8.949708915756618
Type 2 that was earlier was type .	14.118936834103849
Now once this dipole is formed , it oscillates with the electromagnetic radiation and as we know that oscillating dipole radiates light or electromagnetic radiation.	10.435394216982296
Hydrolysis of pen g or v goes to six apa and the six apa is an intermediate for variety of antibiotics , the semi synthetic antibiotic and they are commonly used.	10.969632525254294
So , modulus and other strength , or elongation at break , which means we are talking about brittleness.	10.915711035430986
Therefore one can look at the reaction mechanism as k1 k2 e + s es e + p k - 1 a classical route involving k1, k - 1 and k.	7.70858362820555
Secondly you can choose micro organism which will be able to act on a particular substrate , synthesize required enzyme.	10.714907742922094
So , if this is close to or at least less than 0.3 then chi would be less than 0.5, which means it will promote mixing and which means the closer this the value of delta 1 and delta .	9.832763438908847
It is has been that the elution volume does not depend up on the flow rate which means that the polymer samples are not carried away or dragged away by this solvent molecules; the polymer molecules basically equilibrate between the pores inside and outside , and the higher molecular bonds are resides most of the times outside the pores whereas the smaller molecular what are more size polymer molecules they partition more inside the pore volume; thus taking longer time to elute.	10.86660239287039
That means that whether it binds on left hand site or right hand site the binding of the next substrate on to the vacant site has no effect.	9.570366391072085
They can be synthesized by ring opening polymerization from the cyclic monomers as well , and the mechanism here is chain polymerization.	9.102181632109435
It could not only be packed bed; it could also be stirred reactor in which the enzyme is added and the enzyme solution is allowed to be stirred along with the carrier and after a period of time when the supernatant enzyme activity has come to minimum value you stop the process.	9.955609936510463
So , given a stress from outside they can be separated easily , in other word these small molecules behave independently.	10.381527778335705
The bonds are partial bonds.	10.992741782385943
How do you name polymer molecules.	8.017494253756293
Now , del s del h in this case is for pure monomer.	9.157017826679287
They are just representative reactions; there are many more reactions which come under this category.	8.772850265244402
So , let us draw that.	6.108089909013258
The shift in the equilibrium must be considered in terms of the rate.	8.712175201071261
For example , if you take a reaction of isobutylene plus anhydrous bf 3, anhydrous bf 3, then there is no reaction.	7.664239763363262
And as you can now visualize , that all the chains , now after initiation is complete all the chains will grow simultaneously under identical condition.	10.047119678621176
We need high molecular weight , so this 98 percent conversion may not be sufficient for our , it will not serve our purpose.	10.199430279781451
It this is valid for no numerical number of set of monomers or pair of monomers irrespective of whether the initiation is done by radical or ionic.	10.518795839286476
These are the generally used radical initiator , and most common is a i b n and benzyl peroxides which are used in the lab.	8.910412657436378
In fact the cost of the enzyme is directly linked with the concentrations in the starting material.	8.603695433532268
Similarly , integrate form m 0 to m , t is equal to 0 to t; and you finally get , 1 by m minus 1 by m 0 we get as t , which will lead to 1 minus 1 by p minus 1 t; or , x n is 1 plus m 0 k dash t.	9.449822828912565
Now , if e 1 is a very close to e 2, that means the electronic charges of the double bond in the monomers are very close , then obviously this will become close to 1 and we get a random copolymers , random copolymers.	10.148699788407116
Maximum value means the optimum ph , the optimum or the maximum at which it shows and with a single ionisable residue on the active site.	10.015057948105216
They vary from elastic to , completely elastic to completely viscous behavior , and most of him in the conditions they are viscoelastic , so they have properties of both ideal solid , and viscous liquid or viscous fluid.	10.393152692064207
So these pictures shows the first one is totally diffusion; the b and c part indicate the combined effect of diffusion and partitioning.	9.497610747760282
So , in this case , repeating unit , or number of repeating unit is same as number of structure units; molecular weight of repeat unit is same as molecular of structure units.	7.866793032376761
This is followed by partial ionization of this olefin as well as this alkyl bridge.	11.302642006277567
So , depending upon the value of this del s and , del h and del s , the del g value will depend.	8.49610439185109
Such a process therefore leads to a very efficient catalytic system.	10.15065783254191
You will get a fraction say 3.4 or 3..	12.206240111078365
So , you have a unit , molecular weights are unitless whereas , molar mass has a unit gram per mol or kg per mol typically gram per mol.	8.215620352459545
And then using ir , impetrate spectra we can prove the molecular vibration and finally , with radio frequency radiation , we can use this radio frequency in nmr technique to know the chemical structure of the polymer molecules.	9.123403692859734
No . it cannot form a peptide bond.	8.553326310751386
The major advantage of this method is that it does not require any modification or involvements of the amino acids residues of the enzyme which results in the high yield and stability because there is no modification of the enzyme structure involved in the entrapment methods.	10.750956239159246
So , acrylonitrile will prefer reacting with this as a transfer reaction compared to this whereas , vinyl acetate will be reacting more with this than this.	9.754123489313587
S + e es e + p k sh + you can arrive at the rate expression for such a system as vm.	8.597778758981859
So , if you have monomer polymerized with two chains , then total decrease of polymerization will be 100 by 2 is 5.	8.330771604079848
Then penicillin measurement using an enzyme penicillinase which hydrolyzes penicillin using a glass electrode , this can also be measured.	11.401463771687327
So , this k is boltzmann constant that you known previously.	8.604882732279936
The other method and which has very large variety is based on the formation of covalent bonds between the enzyme and the support matrix under mild reaction conditions.	8.039775429262418
If you talk about the molecular at the beginning of the reaction , that is quite different than the molecular weight of the polymers which are at the end of the reaction.	6.651944371085755
Now how do.	9.597173251978807
Even when we write integrated form of equation we can assume that this is also valid if you make a material balance across the batch reactor because the classical material balance equation requires that input minus output minus conversion should be equal to accumulation.	10.781699098795084
So , you know at the end of your molding step , the molecular weight might be different than what you target it for.	8.640019935287537
There will be hardly any situation where a substrate concentration can change twenty seven fold or such a high level of change.	9.456461334086267
So this , in this case both the carbon atom , the asymmetric carbon atom has same configuration.	10.117143450954735
This equilibrium reaction actually happens almost irreversibly.	12.797686297308056
We will just give brief introduction , brief description of those test.	8.60918171275567
In the same case if you take.	12.02266274066189
Now , let us see how do you analyze how do you analyze these polymers.	7.492561050151385
The basic concept to retain the enzyme as listed here is the use of the water soluble polymer bound coenzyme.	9.193459468258906
They are not as simple.	8.344256271228112
You have values of capital f .	10.15623025585263
Now , the radicals from these monomers will have exactly the reverse order , when you compare their reactivity towards single monomers.	9.246675428416365
For example if you consider let us say ph nine.	9.924615583308377
In most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions which involve multiple intermediates , a single rate constant may not able to define the turn over number.	7.561483510646021
That means if there are three enzyme species number of species are n and n - 1 steps will be involved in each pathway.	8.419061767505502
We talked about the dependence on temperature , dependence of rate of polymerization and molecular weight on the temperature for radical polymerization initiated by different mechanism , thermal initiator , photochemical initiator and redox initiator.	8.792199427445928
Now , what are the step , what are the stages or what are the reactions the monomer is getting consumed.	9.456508726682122
So , in this case also if you , your refracting index of the material , or polymer is higher then , the reflects reflectivity is also higher.	8.010390584983494
After cyanogen bromide treatment , you get an imino carbonic acid.	10.326433109339899
This may be required to be externally added like for example nad , atp , fad or a variety of cofactor that you are familiar with in many of the bio chemical reactions or they could be or they could be as simple as metal ions and the fact that because in the absence of these cofactors the protein is not catalytically active , it implies that these cofactors have a very significant role in the catalytic mechanism which these molecules display.	10.105083020723285
The kinetics will not be dictating.	14.66888586275896
Now , let us move to the one more topic on solubility which is determined cohesive energy density and solubility parameter.	6.11981512189149
Now , other difference of anionic polymerization with cationic polymerization is this possibility of the transfer reaction.	7.917007977904301
Now , if i consider that i t , the consideration of or the number of moles of number of moles of let us do it in the next page.	7.679413355141001
So , basically , now if the polymer start , it is actually the copolymer of methyl methacrylate and this , this monomer and also , not only it makes a copolymer , the reaction also gets significantly slowed down again because of the weak nucleophicity of this anion , generated anion.	11.181675732327733
So , the haze is mainly because of the balls scattering.	7.8878565305091675
L . so in that way also one can determine.	11.716682797010677
So , this is the condition from condition for the equilibrium between the solution side and the solvent side and the solution side.	8.189266364786866
One is by seeing the effect of enzyme loading on the reaction rate that means its proportionality to the enzyme loading changes from linear to proportional to the power half.	9.782377726406576
If you look at the structural understanding of the enzyme what happens when we immobilize either on hydrophilic or hydrophobic matrix.	9.074107685895678
If i take , let us keep that for time being.	10.20334063791515
So , they can form crystalline regions.	6.123929667550016
If the pendent groups are not placed symmetrically , then the t m goes down.	7.214835264124805
The side chains are also free to interact with each other and provide you electrostatic interactions and other features.	11.30614120671474
They will try to replace any person with a machine; that is cheaper and the cost of analysis works out to be very cheap if you compare with hiring a person and also more reliable.	10.737420459107234
The signals can have splitting which gives the idea about the neighbors , and the line shape whether it is a sharp , or it is broad it gives idea about the interaction of the solvent.	10.022696744875276
So , it is always your solvent or the mediums should be such that your function groups are always accessible , should be always accessible to react.	8.090237610113544
A not very frequently encountered effect for reducing the energy of activation is attributed to environmental effects.	9.601861798688116
So , you typically the value of p d i comes around 2 to .	9.68121242630877
There , these are fifty percent of this bisphenols are this type.	12.229128658996883
We need to make few polymer solutions dilute.	11.06137158483619
You know , this reaction is very common and done in bio chemical laboratory for making polyacrylamide gel for polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses; temed is n , n , n dash , n dash , especially diamine tetra methyl ethylene diamine.	9.596222032462721
This slot is slightly longer and therefore while the binding takes place it makes a sort of a strain onto the reactive group and it is analogues to the mechanism which we proposed for catalytic function that means strain mechanism and which contributes to reduction in the enthalpic component of the free energy of activation.	9.654503367106182
If its cyclic form cycles , then it will form low molecular.	10.37236010827417
He also gave a good clue which became a landmark in the applications of enzymes that enzymes are more stable in the presence of a substrate.	8.274449014899313
One is that you have a rather more convenient situation that from here the substrate concentration goes like a profile like this which is more favorable in the sense that around the whole particle there is some substrate available for biochemical reaction to take place.	9.057110221716124
So , this exactly has been shown by plotting in this.	6.98147910101475
These cofactors again could range from a small molecular weight organic molecule.	10.151872487143317
So , n 0 minus i x is the number of vacant cells.	4.902747734493009
So , this is the mechanism by which , halogenated fr along with antimony trioxides synergy works.	6.829395574473674
There transparency has come down , because of scattering , but not that much , haze has gone up.	11.156449152537084
Yeah we have now because we have a dead zone.	12.752474707984044
So , the information about r h hydrodynamic radius of the polymer molecules in solution can be obtained.	8.474232099109672
So it doesn t meet the requisite commercial requirements.	10.421981396213132
Conversion is related to the enzyme activity.	10.981454155310779
The major issue is how to use those data primarily for determining the km value or the vm value corresponding to the particular enzyme concentration.	9.56166098003367
M 1 is styrene and vinyl acetate is m .	11.23649049925627
For example if you start let us say a basic science like chemistry.	8.161216217019401
Now , polymer chains in actual sense are these all segments are attached; for a single polymer chain all the segments are attached.	9.638657501868753
In this case that will in suit that the polymers which are forming , they are not killed or the chains which has getting initiated , they are not killed.	11.084403102414704
The method can be modified to result in reduced loss as a result of steric hindrance.	8.937963649606159
The basic principle of the method is the method employs transition metal salts like titanium tetrachloride , zirconium tetrachloride or ferric chloride for linking an enzyme to the carrier.	9.093070984640436
All this mechanical properties depends on temperature of experiment , and the strain rate or the stress rate.	10.358570280604885
The usual method is that an activated carrier is prepared by steeping it in a solution of transition metal salt for five to ten minutes and mind it that it is important because longer contact of the matrix in the transient salt solution can result in the degradation because the ph of this solution , like titanium tetra chloride , will be very , very low , almost one to two.	10.505136683581227
So , between t g and t m the semi crystalline polymer is composed of rigid crystallites; like rigid crystallites which are composed , which are dispersed in a rubbery amorphous matrix.	9.080655556485059
We can only react with enzyme only when a has bound to it to form and one of the products is released and the modified enzyme substrate complex is generated.	9.002354577080006
For example if you consider a plugflow reactor which has been separated by certain horizontal . . . just to allow a proper mass transfer there might be certain stagnant reason from the corners or in the case of back mix reactors if the impeller is not properly designed or the mixing pattern is not properly designed there might be some region in the whole reactor where the mixing is not uniform and the idea of completely back mix is not realized.	10.104891714091542
Now , case 2 is again , k is similar to k p and k transfer is much higher than k p so r p rate of polymerization , again no change.	8.224436884699838
To overcome this very often they are used in the presence of a solid support.	8.597876239727936
They will be from different groups as we mentioned from electron donating groups and withdrawing groups and one from electron donating groups.	9.356538526505815
One as the free glutaraldehyde , a single glutaraldehyde molecule which contains two aldehyde groups separated by three ch2 groups and it also occurs in the form of a dimer , in this form.	9.798507500696648
If you have styrene radical in a medium , then it will always homo polymerize.	8.711181676661647
Consider the structural conformation of glycerol.	11.570284577800209
In that case the tow is given as - k m ln ( 1 - x ) tanh f e.	6.221920418856096
The titanium tetra chloride solution will exist in different forms complexed with certain ligands.	11.57850099109083
So , this should be clear now.	6.3479368351949805
It may remain as the protein.	9.615031786867513
Now if we are just talking about this expression at point scatterer where the molecule does not or the scattering from different parts of the molecules do not interfere with each other.	8.516309920775466
The axis here is v0 / s versus v.	13.947745376672179
Same stress is applied , same load is applied here , so with time , how the strain will change for a viscous material.	10.508809203215202
So , the molecules , now we just talked about this theoretical number or this expression for this simple polyethylene molecule; now if you have side groups obviously , this rotational restriction will be higher , because the polymer will be much more stiffer than polyethylene molecules , so rotational restriction will be higher.	8.82053014054973
This term mu 1 minus mu 1 0 is minus rt phi 2 x; phi 2 is the volume fraction of the solvent molecules , x is the number of segment of the polymer molecules and so on.	7.717316227162631
This has led to one of the diagnostic method particularly for the patients who are suffering from cardiac problems the lactate dehydrogenase from the heart muscles undergo the quaternary structural change.	9.88690370885758
When we say very high substrate concentration , s &gt; &gt; km and we are talking of zero order design and then the degree of inhibition at very high substrate concentration will be significantly very high because then it will reach the limiting value of 1 + i / ki.	8.764978277256422
As we progress , the molecular rate goes up and again , fortunately , the molecular rate goes up to high , very high level at the end of the polymerization and on the p is very high.	8.485416435520607
So , what is done in practice.	6.4034804437290544
So , that is this happens within 2 to 10 percent of conversion , and we call this part as a stage i , so if you plot the rate of the polymer , polymerization rate with time as more and more and more this active micelles or the more and more micelles take part in the polymerization rate goes up.	8.943613933493479
We know under these conditions the system will be diffusional limited and the activation energy computed in this case was 5.7 kcal / mole.	10.447006021163627
So , that , it can survive the processing condition and it should be chemically unreactive to the base polymer , it is being used.	10.026757534562936
Just alter the ph value.	10.956005117182512
So , these are the criteria s or these are parameters we must remember while determining molecular weight by this method.	8.062430630842647
So , and and finally , where this material is applied so , definitely if you measure a modules or stiffness at say 40 degree centigrade and find your material is sustaining the load.	10.152967812528294
Now , in this case , the ionic species are the initiator or rather the initiators are ionic species , so as the propagating species also ionic.	8.264486541300867
So we must clearly understand the inter relationship between the kinetic order regimes , the fractional conversion and the productivity and the parameter which is very important in the case of reactor performance is the effect of substrate and product inhibition.	9.054860730857424
The same process follows on the reverse of reaction that means eab * under goes break down into products whereby instead of product directly being formed it forms ep , the enzyme bound to the product , the enzyme product complex and then this ep again breaks down to the next level of your product which is same as of the uncatalyzed reaction.	10.401995487119159
So , you should push the reaction as much as possible and also if you want to build a high molecular weight polymer your r should be close to .	6.118803911146069
How , where from do you get this monomers or the raw material.	11.783816018003558
So , this is meta stable region so these regions are metastable c to e and f to d and any composition between e to f is completely unstable , which will immediately phase separate into c and d.	9.500457039851963
The closer this ratio r 1 r 2 to 0, it is the resulting copolymer will be more towards alternate.	11.983868208680741
Then the substrate product should also pass through the cell membrane.	9.91760084659192
Then in the case of plug flow reactors often it has been noted that the conversion efficiencies are much higher compared to cstr and the major reason for that are two.	8.114961890430138
What are the general features of a , chain polymerization process.	8.770591967328343
And this difference will give the delta c p between the glassy state , and the rubbery state , now this if you increase further the temperature.	10.623264560100987
Now , in addition to the combinatorial groups , which is always favorable , favorable in mixing process; in this case , this entropy , because of contact between the polymer and the solvent , which is opposing the mixing process.	10.43130026823094
Now , we can remove this proportionality by applying or introducing a constant; this is a constant.	8.279261826502596
If it is 0.99, there will be 99 percent of the functional groups are reacted , then you get 10.	11.776544206837388
Plus n .	16.32006762623207
Of course , it can be added any of these vacant cells.	9.062556999732003
Again when i say the term high it refers in the comparative form and the comparison here is with covalent binding.	10.352982080474224
The specificity also has a very significant role in terms of the industrial applications of enzymes.	8.241198915276689
Now , what is disadvantage obviously you are doing a solutions of monomer concentration goes down which means rate of polymerization becomes lower and molecular weight becomes lower.	9.292505097611539
For example , like you have alpha methane styrene in case of , say , example , the monomers like styrene , where you always get only one possible double bond because there is only one possible beta hydrogen to be eliminated.	10.080054714013999
And if you need additives , invariably we need really , that the 100 percent polymer is used for any formulation.	10.757041651104634
So , that is , what is the chance that each segment would be giving up a polymer solvent contact.	6.374335237721949
We often consider that if you couple a soluble enzyme molecule on to a solid matrix whether it is an inorganic matrix or an organic matrix or a gel that is the conventional form of immobilization.	10.754768472294478
The large number of cofactor linked enzymes therefore opens a big challenge to the industry or to the scientist who are concerned with the diversification of application of enzymes.	9.896766595328955
It should be rigid if you want to isolate these polymers as a bead then it should be rigid and it should not stick to each other.	8.156386967576912
The rate profile will be hyperbolic in nature.	6.369535254529102
So , basically this properties required for the applications , where it is essential for the polymer to be fire retardant.	8.541506278432461
Other examples , like we will take a benzyl peroxide example.	10.658144183589275
I will try to introduce you with that kind of a system taking a simple example so that , that can be applied to our complex binding substrate system to arrive at the actual rate expressions.	9.504495486887583
Now , the mechanism of these absorption , uv absorption happens that , they basically absorb , and then at excited state , protons transfer happen; and finally , they form a new excited state , which , from which they , by radiation less process they come back to the new ground state.	9.707816290650825
Now , in this case , because this groups , this r group in this case are very larger in size , this s , this side reaction of substitution nucleophilic reactions becomes slow down difficult , so you can actually suppress this side reaction.	8.913131832171464
If you again put this number you will find , that e x n 0 is about 0 kilo joule per mol , which suggest , that there is no effect , no effect of temperature on molecular weight for a redox initiated radical polymerization , redox initiator radical polymerization.	9.200051259994416
There is no general ruling but in general or a common feature can be considered that at the isoelectric point the ph value will be most preferable for the adsorption processes.	10.47363280861879
So , that typically we get or we make solutions having concentration having less than 20 gram per liter.	7.95416894849956
So , that you can get high molecular weight , high rate of polymerization without building very high viscosity.	9.370158819368426
That means enzyme is the matrix , surface is a ligand.	9.762221334271585
So , more and more of this will generate and to stabilize this , you require more and more surfactant , the number of surfactant which was originally present; in the micelle they are not sufficient to stabilize this.	10.456822374590597
So , total like the case of transfer reaction , chain transfer reaction , we have included this.	11.448406543148042
Then you can find , you take log eta plot with log m v; you get log eta is log k plus a log m v.	9.083332374969855
Same is the case for pmma , if you compare pmma , if you compare the number between 25 and 72; pmma is less stiff at higher temperature , because the rotational restriction comes down as we increase the temperature.	9.378189065408554
And typically if you have , this peroxides , or this s s bonds or if you have n o bonds in your molecules; these bonds typically having bond dissociates energy of this range , so they form on hitting , and a normal , the reaction temperature they form radical , each molecule form two radicals.	11.35467452951744
So it is a form of recycle reactor just like we saw in the case of total recycle packed bed which operates the batch reactor or even in continuous reactor recycle reactors can be used where part of the output stream is recycled and part is taken out as the product.	9.976553475089439
It is not due to its magnitude its value of del h polymerization.	8.297469649223066
Similar situation might arise for a tetramer or a hexamer depending on the number of binding sites on the enzyme molecule.	7.187478525802228
And then , fix this two side and pull them applied force from both the sides , sample is deform , the deformation is done in the constant rate and the amount of stress is required for keeping that constant rate of deformation is monitored.	9.558451347100709
So , n x is the number of molecules having in x mar in x structural units by total number of molecules present in that time is 1 minus p , so p to the power x minus .	7.052866395177029
But in case of synthetic polymers , now these conformations , there are many conformations polymer conformations possible for single polymers and in a polymer sample the average doubt and you do not see any effective optical activity for that optically active conformation.	9.75574188054443
That means the environmental conditions required for adsorption must be mild and here i think i like to very specifically define the term mild.	9.481055789766117
So , as long as we know the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer sample we are using and the elution volume of the sample; using this universal calibration curve we can get the molecular weight which is fairly accurate.	8.722849294530805
Now , in this reaction , the phenol boiling point is 180 degrees centigrade , bp of phenol is 180 degree centigrade.	8.185516958674338
Now , look at these three set of example.	7.06945120899738
Then , it will become more clear the difference in the mechanism of these polymers to polymerization medium.	7.997350670149231
The higher this ratio , this r 1 by r 2, the higher this ratio of r 1 r 2, the higher the longer is the continuous sequence of m 1 type monomer in the copolymer and shorter is the sequence of the m 2, m 2 monomer.	10.224478887863992
I will stop here.	7.747224338866974
This is for a polyethylene terephalate , which has been dried for 100 degree centigrade at 20 hours; that means , the moisture content in this polyethylene terephalate sample is very less.	9.814652384638526
So , it will depend upon the final outdoor application , where these polymers are used.	7.529170233514248
So , once you know that there are several polymers which are made using this technique , then your learning will be complete in that sense.	9.348856266308122
Then obviously , it will react for both the monomer as well as the solvent in this case if it is less reactive then it will choose the most feasible root.	11.43473478443694
So depending on what is the type and size of the pendent group , the melting point gets influenced.	13.413706973374719
So in true sense , the chances of finding a vacant cell near by a polymer chain would be lower than from a distance from a chain.	8.949494819730344
Particularly in some cases of the enzymes which are known to be more stable under alkaline side or acidic side , an immobilization can lead to increased or decreased stability of the enzyme depending on their behavior , although the ph stability as well as optimum ph in the real sense at the molecular level does not change.	10.46609808249766
So , here the composition in the free monomer is same as in the co - polymer , copolymer.	9.259149347060637
That means the polymer chains are entangled to each other and as they are entangled they cannot be moved independently with each other for example , real life example if i have a bowl of noodles and i ask you to take a spoon , no , one spoon of noodles , you cannot independently take out as a noodles to the spoon because they are entangled.	11.09571987249377
For example the cofactors like nad , nadp , they are all ideal electron acceptors and they participate in the catalytic process simply by oxidation , reduction or whatever mechanism is involved.	9.93440737917399
You must understand that the net result of binding of the two reactants to the active site involves in reducing the degrees of freedom of the two reactant molecules and therefore there is a loss of entropy.	10.853323155818083
This is the chemical expression.	7.979138848262277
So , an ideal solution formation leads to a thermal mixing with no change in enthalpy of the system.	8.28910957213683
Remember , we did calibration in we have taken mono dispersed standard; standard means half molecular weight and standards , and then injected , and according to their elution volume , and then for the calibration cut we have plotted log m versus v e elution volume.	10.76077541112894
Now , what happened in that chain , so if there are more than one chains , there are more than one chain in real environment what will happen , now obviously , if you if you consider that this is a , this is unperturbed dimension , and because of excluded volume this is expanding to avoid all the intersections , self intersection it is expanding.	10.277867344252684
So , how the as the overview of the main processing technique , there is a formulation where , this poly solid polymer is added.	9.347156399369704
We need to convert this editor response to weight fraction of the polymer molecules and we need to convert the illusion volume to the polymer molecule weight.	9.018667149399331
The polymer chains are you know entangle to each other so , polymers , the resistance to deform may happen , because of presence of the other polymer chain segment in the near viscidity.	11.330804840014347
The allosteric behavior has in some way an advantageous situation for the regulatory enzymes to function.	10.442558945379195
Now , in commonly it is known as polyisobutylene , but according to iupac it will be poly 1 1 dimethyl ethylene.	9.183533156382476
Typical substrate binding energies range from 3 - 12 kcal mol - .	11.291246704520745
For example , the tacticity whether it is seen that syndiotactic , atactic or isotactic , and then chemically compositions of the of a copolymer , the mole fraction of the repeat unit , the sequence of the different repeat units in a copolymer.	9.340968168796579
And so that is the six membered ring transition state.	8.356170555060048
That means when we talk of kb , kb is that concentration of b at which the reaction velocity v is half of that of vm at a saturating concentration of a.	8.902693112750963
In an inexpensive carrier one may say that you may not be able to meet the other desirable properties.	10.178022231061366
These peptide bonds have a resonance structure.	10.575111511251263
Now , we have we have seen before that the polymer solvent interaction parameter can is actually have two component , the entropy component and enthalpy component.	8.793501150362413
And inorganic fillers , they themselves has high modulus so , these by adding these inorganic fillers , at least increases the modulus of the base polymer.	11.282041238407404
Whereas , at higher temperature , it become soft and a and a along with a ductile , which means it the the sample can be elongated , is more tough in that that sense.	10.174846795623774
In the commercial establishment when we use adsorption as the method of immobilization we use reactor loading process.	8.548727153420765
And between this case , this is the hydrogen is more recently abstractable and in this case , it is this hydrogen is abstractable and this case , this hydrogen is abstract able and this case , there is no hydrogen here so this hydrogen , which is more abstractable.	11.59262822899426
In the three different cases that we talked about for the type of inhibition , in the case of competitive inhibition magnitude of kesi will tend to infinity.	10.674497957684807
Mind it that j . b.s.	11.496840187233028
So , this is the case , where most of the polymers will deal with deal mostly with flexible large polymer chains , so if that polymer moves to the solution , it takes the solvent molecules along with it.	8.649471894246123
For studying the inhibition pattern of each of the product used as an inhibitor let us consider a compulsory order ternary complex formation in which the substrate a binds first.	11.358816567494525
We are expressing here our conformation on a planar diagram.	10.367186057436525
When you put some arbitrary values you can see that in the case of pfr or a substrate independent thermal deactivation the output that means the fractional conversion after time t will decrease much faster than cstr.	9.796473034658286
As you have seen if you know the k h or k k the huggins constant or the kramer constant k h or k k , then only from one concentration itself you can get the value of intrinsic viscosity the molecular weight.	7.962434925715525
Most of the chemically catalyzed reaction or chemical reactions represent a particular order of reaction , zero order , first order or second order.	9.715665062970363
If suppose your substrate is colloidal , we will prefer to use cstr rather than the pfr; it will choke.	11.832543134720138
In the hollow fiber tubes , capillary tubes is the enzymes contained and in space provided between the tubes and the cell the substrate feed is fed into it.	9.458063704131282
Now in case instead of diol if you use hexanediamine and use that adipic acid , we will get poly hexamethylene adipamide.	11.450189651654716
Now , there are other initiation reactions , other initiation reactions , for example , halogen , halogen can be reacting with more acidic lewis acid and gives out cation , halogen cation.	9.305141619552744
If you consider say for example a combined film and pore diffusional effects and for a simplistic case of a first order irreversible enzyme catalyzed reaction , we can club the two things for example the external film diffusion and internal pore diffusion along with the biochemical reaction and the flux of the substrate can be then written as j = kl ( sb - ss ) you will recall that in the external film diffusion , flux of substrate along the particle surface is given by kl which is the external film diffusion coefficient into the substrate concentration gradient that is developed in the film and that if we could equate to.	9.96622119467931
So , p dash becomes close to .	6.71615792993748
But any chain polymerization in most cases performed in a environment or sub - zero temperature.	10.9100279414732
Just said , that there could be two possible double bond in case of this monomers , like isobutylene , alpha methyl styrene.	10.276329405304738
So , most , most popular , most important , this electrophilic reaction is reaction of lewis acids.	8.606553491852695
Now , when you use a plastic material like polycarbonate compared to a glass this becomes much lighter , you know its gives you lot of comfort than the glass.	10.294886284535476
The human error is by and large avoided.	11.26695613253858
No . sorry this is n - cl.	10.859575250944715
There are mainly two motivating factors.	8.596860615053403
When you take a soluble enzyme , a native enzyme and determine its optimum ph as against the optimum ph of an immobilized preparation you find that the optimum ph has shifted and this shift is attributed mainly to the partitioning of hydrogen ions between bulk and the carrier particles.	9.798698718000175
This transient happen this is the transient is is transient it does in take much longer time , does not take too much conversation to achieve that.	11.38779555535913
Now , we can easily write other from this expression.	6.392076112225815
That means the energy requirement of those reactions they catalyze could be very meager.	9.072007855512286
So , in this case this polymer pet is also made from two different monomers terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol and we make a polymer , but generally generally we do not call this polymer as a copolymer whenever , because as i said earlier this monomer terephthalic acid or this ethylene glycol cannot be polymerized independently by all or individually , this terephthalic acid cannot be made polymers by itself or a ethylene glycol cannot be made polymer by this process.	8.684614347383059
V = k [ ehs ] = k . e0.s km ( 1 + ka / h + + h / kb ) + s the whole effect of the change of ph that is the hydrogen ion concentration is influenced by this parameter in the parenthesis.	9.42351743576636
And also if your , the sample is having a larger refractive index then , as a result of higher reflection value , your gloss will be also higher , how do you measure gloss.	9.908301085458522
Now actually this is supposed to m v , the expression gives you k is eta is k m v to the power a.	10.824248155945227
So , this is each segment having this many polymer solvent contact.	7.0415168220730395
As , as a reaction progresses or the conversion goes up , now as we know , that k p is independent of , independent of conversion or the reaction , time of reaction and which comes from the fact of the assumption of equal reactivity of the functional group and we have seen in earlier lectures , that experimentally , that is also true , that rate is independent , rate independent on the conversion.	10.004258981356182
Welcome to this seventh lecture of this course on polymer chemistry.	5.4976987337970655
And then you know q 1 you know u 1, hence you will from these to expression and you also know r 1 from experiment r 1 r 2 from experiment.	9.476748733349323
So , chain length , all the propagating radicals are same.	7.928708446208777
So , in a polyestrification reaction , when you are forming a polyester form the higher c than diol , or form a hydro oxide acid , at any point of time , we will find , in the mixture dioxides and very different size of dioxides , diol and hydro oxides acid , and so on.	8.620839683858016
Now , if you if you look at this numbers , the enthalpy change on the polymerization from a 3 membered cyclic ring to a linear polymer it is highly negative.	8.70820884138809
Another feature which we need to keep in mind is that certain enzymes require cofactors.	9.51658510489367
So in this case , you require a reactive species , to initiate the polymer chain , unlike in step polymerization , where you did not require a , in the reactive species.	9.036177005686046
This is the two example.	7.280842145598428
For the immobilized enzyme you see the km values have significantly increased except on maltose where it has decreased.	10.505267923748889
Some other example we can give.	10.080666145371971
If you recall the method of immobilizing enzymes by adsorption , one of the major drawbacks of the adsorbed enzymes is that they do not possess a very high operational stability.	9.353884844626108
So all these issues we will take individually rather than compounding all of them because not that all the issues will be applied in a particular reactor system we will have to identify the issues which are important.	10.00029026328549
So , they are they are again very high performance high performing polymers , which are used at very high temperature applications; and they can be used in a applications where the constant temperature is say around as high as 240 to 280 degree.	8.797967731588065
So , if you have some polymer molecular weight , which is polymers which is having molecular weight , such a small number , such a small value that it does not entangle mean entangle efficiently.	10.747103080292533
So , it is a only configuration or combinatorial entropy.	6.533237424444228
Higher the substrate concentration the deactivation rate is slow.	10.999015202237194
We will be following general principles about that.	8.60792917234591
So , osmotic membrane osmometry is an absolute method.	8.898590114415397
There might be more than one of each of the type.	8.898954753007326
But the concentration of the substrate in the carrier is higher than the bulk.	7.697176575985997
Any point this is temperature and this composition you get two phase polymer and in this case you get meta stable solution which will be stable to a small fluctuation in the composition , but not in the large fluctuation.	11.592574056377702
The xt value in the two cases after the elapse of time t will be different in the two cases and the output of the pfr , plug flow reactor will decrease much faster with time than in the case of cstr.	8.868371216509926
And , this is the mechanism which is proposed for thermally induced self initiation of styrene , where styrene molecules , 2 styrene molecules by this capering first get dynamised; and then , this dynamised styrene molecule can react with a third styrene which extract a hydrogen atom forming two radicals , which can individually initiate the chain polymers.	9.837630167669696
So , this will be optically active.	6.1163645049563975
Now this expression has been verified for innumerable copolymer systems , and they are , this expression is equally applicable to cationic and anionic and radical copolymerization.	9.473542953041107
Now metallocene , you can actually do the polymerization in the homogeneous medium.	11.940790245675299
They are not completely formed.	7.9331872154992995
Now similar techniques similar methods can be applied to the other two methods like other two colligative properties; for example this similarly the same logic can be applied or same principle can be applied to other two methods like ebulliometry which deals with the elevation of boiling point; boiling point elevation of boiling point where delta t e is t b minus t 0 where t b is the boiling point of the solution and t 0 is the boiling point of the pure solvent.	9.34028018431649
So , the contour length would be multiplied this by the number of bonds.	8.270136027134907
So , it is not very convenient to use the mladi tof in every lab.	7.759262985822108
So , we call this as a semi crystalline state.	6.0124725704280575
So , solvated has three solvated ion - pair or loose ion - pair or they can be totally free , free ion - pair.	9.221948194917973
And you and rest of the monomers are compared with the value of styrene , what you individual monomers or copolymerized with styrene and from the experimental values of r 1 and r 2, you can use these expressions where if you consider 1 as styrene.	10.549771973420045
So we will come back and start in the next lecture from this redox , the other example of redox initiators.	8.617154267690704
So , if you want to design one material , or test some material , which will survive the duration of cars life time about 20 years , or 15 years , then you should test that in advance.	9.05545191132302
You can compare between the values between m a and m m a.	8.552068803273901
The binding sites on the substrate come in proximity or bind to the binding site on the active site of the enzyme molecule.	7.602375101098331
Then this chain can fold itself locally in the shape of either an alpha helix or a pleated sheet so as to give a secondary structure.	10.178214585147156
The lower route is catalyzed one , enzyme catalyzed.	10.705361700509545
Both the products inhibit the reaction.	7.026100706650824
Then we are also ignoring external film or internal pore diffusion limitations if any.	9.593785698228853
Alternatively if your substrate is highly viscous or let us say colloidal in nature , in those cases also a fluidized bed reactor can provide you a much better system for carrying out immobilized enzyme reactions in a continuous mode.	10.75589521653387
So , it can take any steps wherever it wants , any direction , but in case of polymer molecule , states are fixed as the bond length of the , each of the bond length of the backbone , repeating unit; and there are restriction of each bond angle , and there are restriction of also in rotational , we will come and talk about those in details; what i am telling it is , in case of polymer also , it takes the segment takes random flight , random walk , but not as freely as a gas molecules do in case of diffusion; because it takes random walk or random flight , we call this the confirmations of flexible polymer in solution are in melt as random coils or gaussian coil.	10.596168554802661
This is i a , i a is the intensity of light , phi is the yield.	9.30736752662039
I am talking about steady state , because most of the time reaction happens in a steady state , if gel effect or other complication happen , then the situation is more complicated to simply conclude.	10.721366062824295
And the intercept at pie 2 0 would be delta mu 1, which is mu 1 minus mu 0 that is the intercept at pie 2 is equal to 1 of the delta mu to x , this is a simple mathematic you can find out that.	10.245597165657017
So , electro , normal the most cases k is 1 and there are cases like the initiation by the electron transfer reaction where you have biradical , a chain goes from both the sides , so basically the number of chains actually become half effectively.	10.468499619095573
Now , poly ester poly amides are typically synthesized we have discussed earlier they are synthesized by stiff polymerization , but in this case we are making the same types of polymers , which we knew till now that they are typically synthesized by step growth polymerization.	9.219251606559531
So for that is the example a i b n is typically used as around 60 to 80 degree centigrade , and benzyl peroxide typical reaction temperature is between 80 to 95 degree centigrade.	9.417371721264644
Now r 1 is greater than 1, then the tendency for homo propagation is more compared to pros propagation , which means that tendency for homopolymer is more than formation of copolymerization , if r 1 is zero , which means there is no tendency of homopolymerization , it is only , it can only undergo copolymerization.	11.2833358467305
So , basically what does it mean.	4.649181416693872
So , basically matter can interact two three ways , with the radiation it can absorb , and intensity when it absorb , intensity can change from i 0 to o i , so you can plot transmission or the absorbance versus wavelength , and to find out we at which wavelength it is absorbing maximum , and what is criteria and so on.	9.300214011956818
So we will use the same method to prepare an enzyme containing gels.	10.066888159401264
One of the analytical advantage is very often we are required to estimate the activity of an enzyme sample.	8.978696621387389
In contrast to the competitive inhibitor where the km value was altered here the vm value gets altered.	10.968248155769933
And with increasing crystalinity , in case of semi semi crystallized polymers , with increasing crystalinity modulus goes up and also for the cross link polymer with increasing degree of the cross linking , the modulus goes up.	8.541670851453874
Another feature is first we must pay attention to those enzymes which are already available in bulk quantities.	8.784956275438862
So , this is statistical copolymer and this particular case of , which is lot of time to make this two as equivalent , but they are not , in true sense they are not equivalent , random copolymers are not always statistical copolymers , but of course statistical copolymers are random copolymers.	9.93438828629779
Majority of polymers are synthesized in the lab or in a plant from most cases , petroleum resources and some cases form natural resources.	10.401997157207095
The quantity required is also in micrograms.	10.91351296072531
There are no general rules.	8.961102731222136
So , the monomers , which does not propagate , which the monomers do not propagate with the very highly strongly stabilized anion , we required this , this strongly nucluophilic anion and this can be utilized to initiate anionic polymerization of styrene , isoprene.	9.323347818729976
So , we can have a one 3d cell 3d lattice which have n 0 number of cells and the size of the cell of each cell is same as the size of the one molecule.	6.938950522341675
So , remaining number of a group is earlier what n a.	8.247814055814827
Most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions involve more than one intermediate complex.	8.43434075877258
So , basically what you do is , you basically melt in a cavity and then , with particular shape mold , you just compress them and leave it.	9.389083567026216
Now , let us look at the values of this solvents c s is the chain transfer constant for the solvent.	7.3996112094911215
One of the early systems which were applied was way back in late sixties and early seventies to hydrolysis of cellulose and starch.	9.744268444087606
So , move to the next set of polymers is acrylic families and the most important is poly methyl methaculate.	9.199731930766227
We know , we found , that temperature increases , rate of polymerization also increases.	8.297645309661808
Now , as we , as i mentioned earlier also that this expression is we talked about this expression in the last lecture.	6.89406601815106
But their presence in the active site may result from the whole composition of the protein as well as the folding process.	11.232137054007467
Solid state in the sense , where the polymer is applied in room temperature , it is not viscous.	14.385771285322708
Total number of molecule is n a by 2 because each molecules has two functional groups and total number of bb molecules is given by n b by .	10.680938795635498
So , the real chain , real end - to - end distance would be proportional to approximately proportional to this multiplied by this , which gives you 10 to the power 3 by 5, this is approximately proportional to n to the power 315; the rms end - to - end distance for a real chain.	6.6458899511512906
So , if you so if you look at few data's of the numbers for q and e the styrene is arbitrarily taken as 1 and minus 8 minus 0..	10.153926544094805
One of the tools we have got is the analysis of the reaction rate data based on double reciprocal plot.	9.810163457673099
We will just begin our discussion in this lecture from that page.	9.476572828656924
As soon as the first binary subjects complex is formed one of the product is released.	10.094757761395273
Because this is constant , this is constant.	16.005259727699343
Whereas if the plant operator has an electrode in his pocket and he takes a sample and dips into it , the control becomes very easy.	10.247294092489723
This is just a conventional practice.	7.96682977785185
So , the higher the value the higher is the tendency for that solvent to undergo transfer reaction.	7.017930164348509
They are free they are free ion; the lithium ion is a free ion , which means the chain end has a planar geometry.	10.235780386195739
Now , this happens if the monomers have very similar structures and most of the ionic polymerizations also follow this type of behavior.	9.031029996630597
To react , now if you what to if you what this to react with the bisphenola phenolate ion to form a poly carbonate species , this has to migrate to the interface , this is currently now in the organic phase and this is in the aqueous phase.	11.94808471979867
The three parameters which are important in the case of an enzyme electrode are selectivity.	9.108859958765045
Also biomacromolecules for example , proteins , nucleic acids; though these polymers are not part of this course but as a comparison biomacromolecules they function mainly in aqueous environment and to understand the behavior of this biomacromolecules , one must understand the solution behavior of this molecules and the solution behavior of thermodynamics of polymer solutions is for a synthetic polymers are very similar to the treatment you will see for biomacromolecules.	11.349485348130948
Combinatorial entropy of the system is given by the number of possible distinguishable spatial arrangements.	13.434229496353014
But if you have intrinsic viscosity multiplied by the molecular weight , the intrinsic viscosity only this term the intrinsic viscosity multiplied m depends only on the hydrodynamic volume.	9.605800910024584
Polystyrene , generally this is synthesized by continuous solution process.	12.213431023360954
Very often in the case of immobilized enzyme particle we call it effective diffusivity rather than diffusivity.	9.275379171960275
So , what is the equilibrium constant.	7.032207969144915
You have to only check whether the solvent can solubilize the monomer or the reagent and it , solvent should not participate in the undesired chain transfer reactions.	8.993191314885653
The chemist would have to design a reaction which will be inherently having high equilibrium constant.	10.077125035819474
So once you know this , if you know k and a , you can use this expression to find out m v.	10.593876828816374
You can always reduce the radical concentration , but it is not in our hand.	10.131938960890666
If you have ab type monomers , then in monomeric stage also , it can intra molecularly cyclize.	11.20337794400792
Now , these r , r dot can be produced by the hemolytic cleavage of this c h type bonds , in presence of heat from the polymer itself.	8.715451414466612
The situation is a simplified situation where we are assuming that only two terminal amino acids are ionized.	10.579357570250144
The answer is no because in this case , we have only considered the forward reaction , we are talking about propagation reaction , whereas there could be backward reaction , depropagation reaction as well.	8.63828615703963
The third method is the reactor loading process.	8.359325979385456
That means at the solid phase in the enzyme active site and in the bulk phase by boltzmann type of distribution where you can give the concentration in the enzyme phase that is in the carrier matrix given by h + e = h + b exp ( - e.	10.087267380213609
One , uv is uv absorbers which basically absorb and effectively screen the uv light from interactive with bulk of the polymer matrices.	11.00936819141595
Whereas , the other end , extreme other end; the metals the metals which are having much higher conductivity , and they are perfect conductor.	11.23067144688694
Let us take the simplest case.	7.219693224045882
This describes a typical laboratory setup in which a stirred cell type of ultra filtration system has been used.	10.180272891194528
And as we said that , stereo regular polypropylene like isotactic polypropylene and syndiotactic polymers are useful to synthesize.	9.757873825951389
They also do this step , this step compounding step them self.	9.9471869329039
Now , the third case which is raft , reversible addition fragmentation transfer.	8.58055327812723
So , now the copolymers which will forms at the later part of your polymerization copolymerization , because the monomer composition in this case , the ratio of m 1 m 2 or different from beginning numbers.	9.226883852265557
Theoretically the product in a plug flow reactor must come out exactly after the residence time of the feed stream but very often because of the deviation from the ideality of plug flow behavior it might come out almost in a slightly broad zone.	10.736127761166932
So , we can write that v h is proportional; this proportionality sign is missing here.	6.946234423010464
We will discuss the principle and the other things the process while we discuss this techniques individually.	9.253581394299763
So the combined cstr coupled with the ultra filtration reactor can be easily used.	7.482260564633966
So , what i am going to do is , not to discuss each and every term , but pick up few important term , and then explain and then , see how the value of the particular property , or value of the particular parameter , depends on the chemical structures.	9.681124671713366
If you just consider a very small element in this distribution having the age between t and dt and t and t + dt then the fraction of the exit stream of age between t and t + dt will be edt and this fraction integrated over infinite time will give you the total fluid which is flowing through the reactor and the.	8.387189439944498
Similarly if you reduce the concentration or the ph of the buffer in which the reaction takes place you can also bring down the equilibrium constant of the reaction.	8.6289286814625
That means if the substrate concentration comes down reaction velocity is very slow; the metabolic pathway is slowed down; it is not made to zero.	8.902778756523327
Conversion is fraction of functional groups that are reacted in the process.	9.91478149861194
When the activator molecule binds to it , the ea complex becomes an active enzyme complex.	9.627532022951401
But copolymerization is done by ionic polymerization to make block copolymers , where you first make a block of 1 monomer and then add the second block to get a block copolymers.	10.979599360211834
So the value of km / s0 will be larger.	7.9927300449185275
You can start with a one is to one a and b.	7.845115442913856
Most of the entrapment methods have a major advantage of protection from microbial attack because they are constrained within the four walls of a structure almost like microbial cells where all the enzymes or proteins are enclosed within a cell wall in the membrane and within a living cell the enzyme remains safe from microbial attack.	9.811261714580795
How does it is related with the target degrees of polymerization.	8.371742934823168
Imagine , once you form the tetramer , what will happen.	8.778815484791645
The first step is binding of the binding sites onto the active site.	7.96398214008243
Just to give few data for polymer solvent polymer solvent system having different values of i and theta let us look at some data of different polymers and with different solvents as we are mentioning , for all this cases the interaction parameter value chi is less than 0..	10.314463980573798
So , keeping the average same , the polymer property will change , if the distributions also change.	10.365944223087094
And we will talk about this plots , little more; and , how , what does it signify.	8.49665129603418
There is a significant variety as for as specificity is concerned.	7.373895550446247
The main degradation of polyvinyl chloride happened due to the dehydrochlorination at higher temperature , and that starts with chlorine radical.	11.252875841748079
Now , if i write rate constant for these individual step as k p 1, k p 2, k p n , then what is the individual step.	8.695328426025204
Km in the case of maltose has decreased.	11.491006501502541
If it is an ideal plug flow , the closeness of these values s as well as s bar will indicate the ideality of the reactor flow pattern.	9.39753216985756
So , intrinsic viscosity does not depend only on the volume; it depends on inverse of the density.	9.567702497051718
We can determine n , the concentration of end groups and then if you know f which is the number of end groups per polymer chain , then we can easily get the number average molecular weight.	7.724069540721293
We are now looking at a general approach to understand the external film diffusion.	8.09778039473119
Welcome back to this 8 th lecture of this course in polymer chemistry.	5.418281985858418
So , what happened is , in spite of this chain transfer reaction , the rate of polymerization does not slow down because this has the same reactivity with the existing kinetic chain , only thing happens because of this chain termination , chain transfer , the molecular weight actually gets reduced.	9.397806226860444
Energy of activation required for conversion of enzyme substrate complex to the transition state will be smaller.	9.574672781579476
Mention the rate constant in the form of kappa values.	12.874740259746886
One is physically confined or localized in a defined region of space.	6.945396165995057
When a stretch , like stretch a amorphous polymers , then the amorphous polymer align just because it is between stretching the polymer.	10.663187644575613
L is the ratio between the biochemical parameters and the diffusional parameters.	10.04204121778541
Just if we talked about the electrical properties of polymers , and we just talked about electrical conductivity , and we know that most polymers are insulating , and so they are dielectric.	11.729724000724127
So , typically in case of aromatic polyamide synthesis , aromatic diamines are reacted with aromatic diacid chloride and you get this completely aromatic polyamides.	9.663083388623926
Because each raft agent forms one radical , so we have to come include the concentration of the raft agent as well as initiator concentration.	11.982370354860546
There have been reports , although rare not very common , that the enzyme activity increases as a consequence of immobilization.	10.364858882237858
And we just initiated discussion on termination and as we discussed , that in case of both cationic and anionic , polymerization is bimolecular , bimolecular reactions between these propagating species is , so termination is not that , done that way.	9.591545388568834
After all the accuracy of our determination or analysis of experimental data will largely depend upon the accuracy of our experimental methods and whatever data point you get we can always make a statistical fit to form a straight line and get the values.	10.646693553696629
But still it gives you a very approximate situation for designing a reactor or making some design calculations to work out reactor size or the capacity of the reactor , accepting that and even compare between soluble enzyme and immobilized enzyme but otherwise under idealistic conditions , the assumptions in the michaelis menten equation that of the initial reaction rate , absence of product division is not met here.	9.813620869978232
The enzyme glucose isomerase is a very thermo tolerant enzyme of the order that the optimum temperature of the glucose isomer ranges between 70 to 80c and therefore you can take the cells give a heat treatment whereby most of the other enzymes which are able to act on glucose are inactivated but glucose isomerase still remains active and use that heat treated cells for immobilization.	10.565063275797806
This rate equation again has to be verified with more experimental data.	10.652792972428035
Let us talk about conversion now.	6.729795024856998
This diazonium derivative is highly reactive and can react with number of amino acid residues that are present on the enzyme molecule.	8.38313650814524
It could be repetition of this , one polymer chain could have several blocks , but this length should be significantly higher so that we can call them block.	10.247188719381956
Ph as equal to.	12.993194661969024
So , this is example of , where you are getting a chain transfer by the monomer itself.	7.143303556037408
One of the reasons in such cases is based on the different reaction mechanisms that are involved.	7.795551692072015
That means the extent by which the rate of the enzyme catalyzed reaction is reduced by the inhibitor can be reduced by increasing the substrate concentration in relation to inhibitor concentration.	9.598369101261124
This is your maximum reaction velocity and your half vm will be this one where ka apparent with respect to substrate a will be k a . kb + ka . b kaapp = kb + b similarly here this situation will become v0 when the value of b is saturating.	8.802624585951888
So the other equations , used are given by this one by t g w 1 by t g 1 plus w 2 by t g .	10.018850687296382
In this lecture , we will try to cover anionic chain polymerization , which we started in the last lecture and will complete our discussion on termination reactions and then touch upon the kinetics of anionic chain polymerization and also the molecular weight in this type of polymerization.	9.951033081617151
But the choice of the method will depend on what enzyme we are trying to immobilize because we must know the functional groups that are involved in that enzyme molecule so that any method which is based on coupling of that particular functional group which is involved in the catalytic function must be avoided.	9.334569999118692
And then join these points , this points to get a bell safe curve which i just come in a minute.	8.816139777946768
So , in this case if n is number of repeat units then it each unit consist of two structure units because in this repeat units is derived from two monomers , one terephthalic acid unit , one ethylene glycol units.	8.745768334621395
So you make a fine droplet , fine emulsion.	9.795266363013583
If one the , in the copolymer , if one of the polymers you know the two monomers they have a different uv spectra , uv - visible spectra , then we can follow their , we can isolate their polymer after the polymerization is over from the polymerization medium , then we can get the composition simply by studying the uv spectra , uv - visible spectra of the polymers.	9.70920483187211
We will talk about chemistry of polymer additives , and we will give examples of polymer degradation , and how the stabilization is done using externally added additives.	8.524363664086493
So , this gives your concentration in terms of mass by volume.	8.000928693175371
This is because of both satirical electronic , and steri creations.	10.314984418333847
The binding of the substrate to the enzyme molecule is not a process which is within the purview of activation or transition state.	8.639480397531448
So , if you look at the temperature independent term and put in the left hand side , i can put concentration m f to the power half and i to the power half.	6.5590556255591945
When we may start the experiment they are wet with the solvent which of our interest.	9.334907341229739
Just take a rear example of block copolymer , of bpa polycarbonate and pdms.	10.762927932850546
So , instead of taking aa plus bb , you take just b in excess.	8.95091132747275
What is the temperature and then only the enzyme function can be ensured.	10.546288941645363
You take blood in; the dialyser unit is little compact same dialysis bag only thing is much smaller because as soon as the urea comes in the dialysate instead of being thrown out it is passed through an immobilized enzyme column , the one which is shown here as microcapsule in which ion exchange resin and the enzyme have been immobilized in microcapsules.	10.053824790395185
Now , in anionic polymerization , this , lot of side reactions can happen by which , by which the polymer chain can get terminated.	9.48247005199607
Carriers like organic ion exchange resins like d i cellulose and di sephadex have been extensively used for immobilization of enzyme by absorption and after use when the whole enzyme is desorbed the carrier is again available for reuse.	11.220375551979592
One of them which have been applied is developed by mccune and wilhelm.	10.16518040036566
So , we will consider this reaction while calculating or while determining the , or looking at the kinetics of this chain polymerization.	7.047665157646525
We can write all this from this arrhenius - type expression and this is , this term e p plus half e d minus half e t , we are writing as the entropy of the polymerization reaction.	8.850268069381949
Other techniques like extrusion blow molding where , the extruded polymer is placed in form a tubular profile is like this , this is a tubular profile and it is placed inside the mold.	11.651248024126895
The second is the nature of the lineweaver burk plot which becomes convex to the 1 / s in x - axis which means that the enzyme is more sensitive to diffusional limitations at lower substrate concentration.	8.782281903826494
Remember , the rate expression for redox reaction , it was k p m k d concentration of reductant twice k t to the power half and x n bar could give you k p to the power m k p m twice over b twice k t k d red ox to the power half.	9.28567029458782
So , basically drawing them is very difficult , unless they are stabilized by adding external additives.	7.701573729869266
There are other amino acids particularly like histidine or cystine or tyrosine.	10.442642625627338
Starting from polyester this is not exclusive least of polymers or it is not the detailed synthetic process or all the processes , which are utilized commercially.	12.84192596388594
This is not a condensation reaction , but if you compare this polymer along with another condensation polymers , they have similar backbone structure , like if you compare with polycarbonate , this has this structure.	9.732016939227865
And , they catalyst by presence of acids or basis we know organic chemistry that hydrolyzes is catalyst by the presence of acid and basis , and vinyl polymers do not usually undergo this type of hydrolysis.	10.434795023659214
We will find depending how t g you are getting , you estimate , or you can predict or you know , whether the blends are miscible blends , or they are partially miscible blend or there completely miscible blend.	10.266419359938682
Once the method of immobilization , the nature of the matrix and the substrate are defined the value of p will remain constant and the value of kappm is dictated by the parameter f and in the case of f what we call as a thiele function , the form of f is very significant and this can be considered to have a very unique profile.	10.57594219101958
Now that will depend up on which is having higher length , whether there is a functional group or not.	9.32931761817372
You can add 2 extra for the two ends , which is z being high , i can just write , we can ignore the two ends and write this.	11.329409496883454
And as we have seen , that to reduce the cyclic formation , cyclic molecules formation , it is preferred , that we do the reaction in high concentration of monomer.	8.035017022032768
There are some , but not many in numbers.	9.21045395369963
If we look at adsorption of a small molecular weight material or a small molecular weight ligands on to a surface the general behavior is that increasing the temperature reduces the adsorption.	9.22082791259132
This is a structure of the block copolymer , where this block consist of a pdms block , and a base phenyl polycarbonate block , depending upon , which is higher , this polymer may be a , as elastomeric or thermoplastic if , the amount of rubbery phase that is for pdms is higher , high siloxane percentage , then this polymer bf block on a bf as elastomeric , and if the amount of siloxane is lower , than this block copolymer behave as thermoplastics.	11.477415142907008
Such reactors in terms of fluid dynamics probably provide a performance somewhere in between the cstr and pfr but are ideally suited for the reactions which have a requirement of good heat and mass transfer because in many of the situations like in packed bed the heat and mass transfer may be very difficult and particularly in case of reactions which are exothermic in nature there might be lot of local heat hot spots which can inactivate the enzyme.	10.444958910489527
Basically first copolymers as we styrene , get the experimental values of r 1 and r 2 get from the expression you get q and e for the unknown monomers.	8.563585776025736
So , in this case the enthalpy of crystallization is not taken in to account.	7.017638724691923
It means that intrinsic viscosity is proportional to v h by m; v h by m is volume by mass of the polymer coil.	10.111506083157101
When you mix this alkyl aluminum and titanium chloride , the catalyst actually gets precipitate from the solution and when you add ethylene or propylene , it is a heterogeneous polymerization.	10.404202443765913
If we talk in terms of adsorption , the substrate gets adsorbed on to the enzyme surface.	12.5351098807908
Let us go through the next property , which is flammability , or flame and flame resistance properties of a polymer.	8.82289521672871
So , in terms of kinetic factor the higher the chain length , the lower is the possibility of formation of ring.	8.805217259961964
The ligand particularly the water molecules which are present here are replaced by the hydroxyl groups present on the carbohydrate molecule and you make a network , titanium treated cellulose which is complexed along with the length of the chain on the carbohydrate is formed.	9.545412081678672
When we see the reaction rate these understanding can be used even for use of enzyme as analytical tool or the action of the enzyme itself.	12.495152758619314
Now we are not writing rate of transfer by polymers because as you seen that polymers , they do not contribute in terms of decreasing the number of molecular weight of the polymer.	9.621536350192045
Obviously , this reaction will be a a b b b a.	10.917127231786386
But , the rate at which this two radical his finding each other is determined the diffusivity of the this molecules.	8.539361191358196
They are also used for thermal insulations.	9.651551755346262
So , basically you were narrowing your distribution.	6.356715087259923
Because , new radical form is also consume in monomer in same rate molecular weight because the number of transfer reactions rate constant for transfer reaction , is much higher than the chain propagation reaction.	9.720841980390292
Look , if we have the same polymerization , same temperature , same initiator , but if you increase the polarity of the medium , obviously if you increase the polarity of the medium , t h f is highly polar solvent.	7.838315035601982
And that is because the this radicals are entering into this micelles or the polymer particles randomly , the probability that you will find at any point of time , the chances or the probability of finding at any point of time 1 radical or 0 radical is same.	7.860455653616069
So , what happen for some time there is no polymerization reaction at all the monomers is not consuming at all , which means as soon as radical is form it is reacting with your benzoquinone present.	9.941000235091003
We will talk about these polymerizations , when in a later lectures briefly.	8.40296776509651
And , or the fraction of the radicals which are produced by homiletic cleavage or the redox reaction of the initiator molecules; they are not 100 percent of those starts a chain polymerization , or the initiate chain polymerization , in part of which are get lost.	10.631115216877845
It is not that the proteins are not charged at that ph.	8.119343484056271
You can have branches like this or you can have branches like this as well.	7.1696168067585075
He only proposed the dissociation constant of enzyme substrate complex.	6.510348855118008
Orientation effect is a much broader term in the sense that it will include orbital steering as well as the aligning of certain functional groups on the substrate molecule but orbital steering is aligning of only electronic orbitals in a particular fashion at the site , which will result in the net catalytic function.	9.83939286264232
So the message is that in addition to the natural reactions catalyzed by enzymes there is always a range of non - natural reactions that are of commercial interest.	8.855313317722857
The pka is different and ionization will totally depend on the pka value of the functional group.	8.831655073201963
That is interesting because if you start with the pure monomer and if your t c is your reaction temperature , then the equilibrium value of your free monomer is same as the pure monomer.	8.89611319975518
Now , if you mix this two molecules , they will mix it easily no problem but similar polymers like polyethylene , if we increase this chain long enough , it will make polyethyl.	9.984113292205123
The sodium is replaced by calcium.	13.221730898564761
At 80 percent at gel effect initiates as much lower conversation at lower time or even for bulk which is 100 percent monomer it happens even before that.	10.365352241075556
So , in this case as we discussed in the last lecture , what you do we actually dissolve the initiator in monomer , and then heat it to the required temperature , or the temperature we are planning to do the polymerization reaction.	7.911384945217012
It could be the other way as usual.	8.184317329051877
That means as long as you are keeping the temperature range in the environment of the reaction within a close range the enzyme may be functional but if the temperature ranges are shifted drastically to the higher side the deactivation occurs and a very broad picture of deactivation has been discussed earlier which is represented by a first order deactivation kinetics where you can define as e = e0 e - kd . t here also you can make a first order kinetics analysis that is your ln e / e0 versus time will give you a profile with a negative slope and slope will be equal to - kd and this will be a function of temperature.	9.880112875241942
Consider that we have an immobilized enzyme preparation with a very high enzyme loading.	8.772031961269697
First one is atrp , atom transfer radical polymerization.	8.532395391071171
So , temperature goes up as a temperature goes up rate of polymerization again goes up , as a rate of polymerization goes up more and more heat is generated.	9.97492919987931
So this entropy mixing is always positive.	9.344406275280091
So , what you need so you need a hetero atom in the ring in the cycling wave , which we have a ring like say ether molecule see this ether or a ester or say a amide they might can do there is if you use asilo base they can actually do nucleophilic or electrophilic attack on this ring and reopen.	9.772679550173102
There are a large number of examples which will illustrate my point.	6.491568613167583
In the last lecture we were discussing about gel permeation chromatography , and then about mass spectroscopy for determining polymer molecular weights.	7.7175258824166315
Now , how do we determine this r 1 and r 2 experimentally we have been talking about.	6.963719745478116
As soon as the binding groups come in contact with the binding site as they have interacted here the active site undergo a change in conformation and this catalytic sites are brought in proximity so as to wrap around the reactive group on the substrate molecule and then the ultimate conformation of the enzyme substrate complex which can use one of the mechanism by which catalytic reaction can take place , can be applied.	10.247776362182494
They bind with the enzyme and have dynamic complexes that ultimately break down to form the product.	8.883622113145623
If you consider b as a constant at some value of b the expression will turn out to be analogous to michaelis menten constant.	8.568615588437327
We have just studied resonance effect and polarity effect and steric effect , which might alter the reactivities of the different monomers.	8.59647398570259
For that you have to first identify the constitutional repeat unit of the polymers.	8.413543434995626
So , it can be covered in a specialized course on polymer synthesis itself.	9.002117867305726
Compatibilizers , they are like a lock copolymer type surface - active agents , which which go and occupy the interfaces between two polymer phases , to reduce the interfacial energy between that two polymer phases and act as a compatibilizer.	11.688739937953585
Both immobilized enzymes and immobilized cells are used.	9.88378281184912
It could be a covalent bond , it could be some non - covalent interactions and those methods fall under carrier binding methods.	7.968412439952956
And you have to consider what is the diffusivity.	13.702504254094482
At low temperature and high strain rate , polymer demonstrates elastic behavior , as we have seen earlier in our strain stress discussion.	9.816114678139252
Besides a macromolecule of various combinations of amino acids , the enzymes may also be considered as a catalyst.	10.053248784616898
One major advantage here is that the nylon molecule being non - immunogenic provides a much better material for putting into the human system.	10.714698295605064
And we started our discussion on termination reaction for anionic polymerization.	6.225720060352982
And , then , m is present in everywhere.	10.160179367889695
So , i minus x cells are already occupied.	6.4941053046483646
The information on the individual rate constant will also give you an understanding on how the enzymes will function at the metabolic level.	10.6754938746757
If you plot let us say ln ( s0 - s ) / s0 - s and t / s0 - s , you get the slope of k 2e0 / k m and with the intercept as - 1 / k m sorry.	10.474846024824997
Now , what we will do.	3.520389749588685
In japan.	15.481360559879718
Now , t g of the polymer also becomes slower in presences of solvent in this case m m a as a monomer , which is called plasticization which is basically the reduction of t g in presences of any solvent in this case solvent is the monomer itself.	11.839366647558121
So , we can find out the i initiator molecule concentration of time , so we know we know the value of r i.	7.945585474250981
That is the sort of system that we have to look for our ideal reactor performance.	8.063151189438631
When we discussed the various ways in which the enzymes are able to catalyze reactions we understood that binding of the enzyme to the substrate was a very important feature in the acceleration of the reaction rate.	9.876066482775297
Then , rate of polymerization also will be lower compared to a normal radical polymerization.	8.837612540942906
The effect is quite complex and the effect can be considered on the basis of the shift in the equilibrium or on the ionization of either substrate molecule or on the enzyme active sites.	8.851720068291923
So , m n would be given by m e multiplied by f where f is the number of end groups per chain.	7.856601724284332
Just to take up the analytical applications the variety of applications that have been reported can be classified into four different types : the first is automated analysis procedures by combining immobilized enzymes with various analytical tools.	10.810535601606256
We come across variety of analytical situations whether in the area of research or even in the area of clinical analysis where the samples are analyzed in large numbers and be required to use very specific reactions that can be catalyzed by enzymes.	10.068316759488557
And we also introduced the term kinetic chain length how it is related to the average number number average degrees of polymerization.	7.047426671947354
That means the folding of the polypeptide chain into an alpha helix results with hydrogen bonding between the nh and - co residues located at the distance and this interaction results in a very smooth and regular dimensions of the chain in the case of alpha helix.	10.222882535112385
In case of polymers to homopolymers are.	8.031288921021298
Purer the enzyme , the better for immobilization because you can have a very highly active immobilized enzyme preparation or the source will also be important , if you can choose a source which gives you an enzyme which has a much higher specific activity.	12.482397166430024
L is greater than two and at low substrate concentration.	6.2732292276742605
One is the ionization of the two amino acid residues.	7.444766722692799
What we measure is basically m e is the equilibrium equivalent mass is m by n which is defined as m by n; m is the mass of the polymers or concentration of the polymers and n is the concentration of the end groups.	10.95706081628587
Some of you may be familiar with them and most important one is diversity.	8.600010030489447
Therefore one is by binding process the enzyme processes started at much high energy level then the ground state as applicable in the case of uncatalyzed reaction and the other is the complementarity of the enzyme conformation to that of the transition state complex.	10.353207122561848
So , what are the other observation we can make here , say at for a conversion of p.	8.012524338562653
Now , in general , we can write m n dot plus m m dot gives write k t is the dead polymer.	8.793545337800445
We will move to the next class of polymers step polymers polyamides and we have this is linear poly polymerization reactions this is aliphatic diamine with aliphatic diacid you can directly under go reaction to form linear polyamide.	9.265276286354457
And this reduction of entropy becomes more permanent if you have a large size polymer or if you have a small size pore.	9.908859663611006
Finally regenerability of the carrier is a factor you will notice in one of the examples which i have given today that although the carrier is very expensive the cost factor here as we have mentioned may be high but if it is regenerable the cost can be taken care and does not contribute very significantly to the overall cost of the process.	10.658203088684383
So , even if at high conversion , the length of the polymer chain or the oligomer chains are quite high.	7.359325974940062
In the case of random ternary complex formation the enzyme can form binary complex ea and eb to start with and also the ternary complex eab with no restriction on the order in which a and b bind to the enzyme.	8.985521047824177
So , enthalpy of mixing should be .	9.629362228988489
Now , what does these two expressions says , that t c and m e are related , they are not independent to each other.	7.579573638521002
Now , typically in case of cationic polymerization both e i and e p are lower than the termination activation energy as can be justified because that bimolecular termination is not possible and e p values are typically for minus 20 to 40 kilojoule per mole , which also depends on the monomer structure for same monomers.	9.284890168960022
That means it should be able to switch on and off the path way with a very subtle change in substrate concentration.	8.692602081039816
Now , what is , what is the problem in if we have cross link formation or if there could be , in some cases there could be some advantage , some property advantage if we have lightly cross link network present in your polymer system , that i will discuss in the next lecture and with giving you some examples of where this deliberately , this uncross - linking is done to utilize that polymer for a special property.	9.517393764695614
What you simply need to do is at the tip of the electrode you need to insert by some mechanism an immobilized enzyme layer so that when you dip that electrode into a sample liquid , the sample comes in contact with immobilized enzyme layer usually in the form of thin film and the reaction takes place; the product goes through and it is sensed by the ph electrode.	10.435273936214747
The use of enzyme reactors , the types of reactors that are possible to be used with the mobilize enzyme , with soluble enzyme , their characteristic features , comparison between their performances , how to choose the enzyme reactors , then mass transfer and immobilize enzyme reactors.	9.968132247802918
You will recall that so far we have seen the role substrate molecules play to influence the rate of an enzymatic reaction.	8.656641076337086
The reaction cannot proceed in this direction that is b cannot bind to the free e and the reaction has to proceed in an anticlockwise fashion that means after e has bound to a , b will bind to ea , eab will be formed and ultimately this will form ey releasing one of the products let us say x and then this will release another product y and they will be let us say k3, k.	11.159809331030699
Can you make polyethylene by this route this way , can you make polyethylene from either of this either of this by ring opening polymerization.	10.773799385524951
Then what will happen , again the intramolecular intramolecular intersections or intramolecular long range interactions will try to expand.	10.343961287619665
Though they are very , they are brittle.	18.270735436929108
H value in the case of enzymatic reactions and this gives almost about a temperature change of 0.2 to 0.3 degree centigrade which can be very easily monitored.	10.809015970944387
So , with this ratios , it can be shown that if you know this.	7.928165110728569
The major breakthrough in the enzyme kinetics was michaelis and menten as early as 191.	12.607247341807499
To this a cross linking reagent usually n , n - methylene bisacrylamide usually often called as bis is added and an enzyme solution is mixed with it.	10.139397644897667
And we also can because it as if it can determine the solubility of polymer , it can also simultaneously detect the solvent resistance behavior of the polymer.	9.37196375920641
Obviously , they also being some challenges for example , with this inorganic fillers the transparency of the base polymers is basically come down.	9.896915505981253
So , what is done in the experiments.	6.322424835767508
And he also should know that why in reality pdi always end up being slightly higher than two because of side reaction cyclization.	10.633406114263472
The whole reactor will operate almost closer towards zero order regimes and that expression can be given by ded2s / dx2 k 2e0 = 0 if you consider that we are talking of a cylindrical disk with a thickness of 2l , i would like you to develop this solved equation to get the substrate concentration profile as a function of distance from the centre.	10.2883726774403
So , the rate of polymerization will be higher.	4.427413781479428
So , you get drop in r dot concentration and you get more and more z dot at beginning once the concentration of z dot is sufficiently higher compared to r dot and also f chosen this equilibrium such a way that the equilibrium constant is towards this side.	9.210480517349142
So finally , we can get an equation like this.	7.347913409518355
You can start slowly , which means that you take a you take the reaction and carry out the reaction for some time at a lower temperature and at atmospheric pressure.	9.66730308628458
We will discuss the osmotic pressure method in detail following by brief discussion on solvent vapor pressure lowering method and we will just mention about the third and fourth properties.	9.865307988562698
To just give you a example of copolymers i have a say i have a molecule like styrene and i also have a molecule like methyl methacrylate.	9.662430197698258
If they are in , terminated by a coupling reaction , then you have twice nu is the molecular weight , average molecular , average degrees of polymerization; whereas , if they are terminated by disproportion reactions , then the average degrees of polymerization would be equals to the kinetic chain length nu.	8.92709165356611
The term bi - bi refers to substrate and product.	8.751513109843962
This initiates the polymerization.	8.31342256900292
So , we need to find out the delta h mixing or enthalpy of mixing for the polymer solvent so that we can get the free energy of mixing for the polymer solvent mixture so in next lecture , we will first get the enthalpy of mixing and then proceed from there to get the total gibbs free energy of mixing for a polymer solvent system.	7.799969471239343
And the rest of the steps are similar where , it the molds inflated with the inner gas and then , cooled and the part is taken out.	8.57142693255355
What i mean , that if they are very tightly bound , they are very tight , then obviously , the accessibility of , or the reactivity of this ionic center are less.	11.89871796479304
But , molecular weight of average molecular of the structure unit in this case , we have 2 structure units in this unit.	9.814341700574138
Glass like we talk about glass then , if you keep a glass and you can put a load on it , it does not break.	13.428319523415352
And this gives you a syndiotactic rearrangement.	10.829481820658078
You measure the enzyme activity lets say for example for different particle size in a reactor and the effectiveness factor works out to be more than one.	10.549317165441346
Now , because of the lighter of weights polymers used heavily in transportations like car automotive , in trains and all these things because the light you travel that will consume less fuel.	9.509283868270314
So , you will form product like.	7.026784625376993
But in the case of specificity of enzyme action the only way to understand the specificity is that we monitor the product formed on the substrate and then we can say yes this is specific to the substrates.	10.6884070054023
It basically , help us to determine the presence of functional groups in polymer molecules.	10.448277531905292
In the third configuration.	7.852371590141734
The numerator whatever we will write for es and et will also be added in the denominator so the sigma will be e.	12.315748531782413
Second thing is that the micro environment of the enzyme can also be tailored to suite its stability.	11.608052011687217
So , compare vinyl acetate it has more tendency to transfer reaction with c c l 4, but the acrylonitrile has more tendencyto undergoing tri methylamine.	9.737786618907212
Now , the main difference between these three branches chain in all are that all of these three are called branch chain polymers.	8.292249231981591
Only the statistical , statistical copolymers , which follow this law , they are called random copolymers , which are very common anywhere.	12.610649891589548
If we look deeper into the transition state , the formation of transition state can be described as a very easily studied , as an ordinary chemical equilibrium process.	8.720049841735268
So , this approaches and forms a pi complex with the titanium center and which gives you then , next what happened.	8.347450077190024
Now this does not improve the brittleness , of the impact properties of polystyrene too much.	9.297968385981374
Now , how the molecular weight or degrees of average number average degrees of polymerization related to nu , it is twice nu , if the chains or the propagating radical terminates by coupling and it goes to nu , if the termination happen by disproportionation.	10.426720361861248
So to increase t m with this chain stiffness mobility , if we increase chain stiffness , we increase the chain stiffness , if we increase the chains stiffness what happened.	9.751605700440749
So , basically good properties are favored by high molecular rate of polymers.	7.526314139643591
K2 k3 / k2 + k3 in fact just assume when we will proceed further we will develop a system by which we can write the expression for more complicated kinetics because when we write for a single enzyme substrate complex developing the steady state rate expression is very simple.	10.013679442702161
Binding part whatever is consumed is different and that doesn t account for because we are talking only one phenomenon , the increase in the catalytic rate and that takes place as a result of decrease in activation energy.	10.315029961872375
If you consider any fraction at time t1, the fraction of the exit stream which has age less than t1 will be zero to t one edt; the fraction of the exit stream which has age younger than t.	8.184305942576026
Again we will have the same 3d lattice in this case as well but here the difference is that n 1 is again the number of solvent molecules and n 2 is number of polymer molecules.	9.784116740919227
Turn over number may work out to be a lump parameter consisting of more than one rate constant.	11.073354884482221
But because of their mobility , the side chains , they generate lots of free volume and hence the entire polymer chain becomes more mobile.	10.33757437571538
So , if i want to write a structure of pet then i can take these units and put one after one to build the polymer units or the polymer molecules.	7.541566717580089
The first and probably the simplest method of immobilization is by adsorption.	7.575849558676667
For example in this practical case of penicillin acylase catalyzed hydrolysis of penicillin the kinetic rate expression comes as k2.e0 v = 1 + km / s ( 1 + a / kia ) + p / kip ( 1 + km / s ) they have developed the reaction performance equations but the quantitative comparison of cstr and pfr in such cases will become more and more complex.	8.897587714199299
So , i would expect that which are not covered in this in this lecture you please read the book or any other text to go through the common synthetic method for those polymers as well.	8.9410438214099
Now , let us , let us begin with some real life example.	6.998916607730814
But , in case of step of polymerization , we are talking about number of molecular present that means , each one each molecules whether it is a monomer or dimmer or trimmer , that also are in those are also included part of polymer polymer sample.	9.628717934248343
L , the characteristics of this function is that when.	11.470561370979004
When we evaporate a polymer solution , then the polymer chains can align themselves up because evaporation is a slow step , slow process . .. . . polymer chains in the solution have more time to align themselves.	10.285113734512407
Now , if the structure of z is such that its inactive radical , then this would not take part in propagating , radical propagating step.	9.71163294434608
Obviously as we you can recollect this the delta can the cohesive delta is the we see square root we see the cohesive density and cohesive energy density can be found from molar energy of vaporization or molar enthalpy of vaporization.	10.198490673480347
For example , if you consider three monomers like styrene , butadiene , and methylmethacrylate , the solubility in water of these free monomers are gram per liter , butadiene 0.8 gram per liter , whereas mma is 16 gram per liter.	8.532447563233461
In case of this left side is step polymers and this side is chain polymers.	8.181546139274749
Very often the k2 is also called as turn over number which is the rate limiting step in the enzyme catalyzed reaction.	7.636247680652221
And if we get the concentration of the initiator residues , then you can divide by the number of chains to get b.	9.555884507032939
So , we , we also did not consider , that there could be possibility of transfer reaction.	7.1563270737291065
Similarly you have another pattern k2, k3b and k4 and the relative concentration of the enzyme species e will be e0 ( k - 1k3k4b + k2k3k4b ).	9.550395516191507
They are like having infinite molecular weight cross linked polymer network.	9.504063846654605
If you have similar polarity , then they will tend to form an ideal polymerization.	7.259895452643025
Now , if we carry out this reaction in a close system , if the equilibrium constant k you say 1, then the equilibrium conversion would be 0.5 and which will lead to degrees of polymerization , average degrees of polymer of .	9.721715313910929
So , we now move to that.	5.716294145111801
That is what happened in strain development also.	8.810625648426662
This is s; this is the product stream.	10.11680756681965
Now , for this suspension of this rigid non non interpenetrating sphere , einstein s equation of viscosity of a suspension is given by this expression , again this is viscosity of the suspension of the solution of this is.	9.522285152776998
That means these two dissociation constants are identical.	7.331941866599934
So , in this case lets draw for simplistic spherical micelles , so you have surfactants mainly as micelles , but also you have free surfactant in the water medium; the concentration of this surfactants are cmc.	9.770387918221738
This halogens form hydrochloride or hydrobromic acids , that reacts with the antimony oxides to form antimony halides or antimony oxyhalides , which basically traps those free radicals.	10.81499179722827
You are taking it to cure the decease but slowly you are also getting exposed to certain side effects.	9.29306783099862
Because , this is when you doing some polymer synthesis and characterizing them , finally you are targeting for some application and applications are linked with polymer properties.	9.854458938347902
Remember , we have discussed in the last lecture that you have in gel permeation chromatography the polymers are passed through a columns containing beads which have definite pores.	9.876537294861349
So , if you reduce the lambda then your sensitivity goes up; the light scattering technique is not good for low molecular weights , because this i theta value for loads low molecular weights is very small , i theta is very small; very difficult to detect and also d n by d c value for molecular is very low.	8.951325797129696
So , look if we , if you further apart from the backbone , they keep on increasing the chain length.	9.166464238511557
In ion exchange chromatography very often we use high ionic strength as a medium for elution of the adsorbed material.	10.245462721019605
Actually if the m n for the pure polymer sample is 10000, then if you have 0.01 weight factor of impurity , then the measured m n of the impure would be about 150.	13.578101671211307
In fact fluidized bed reactor itself is a hybrid between the two major classes.	10.31102412023238
And i will come to the example of interfacial and polymerization.	8.409230401870737
Injection molding is done mainly for thermo plastic material and it is similar to the extruder machine , there is a hopper where , you add the gremial polymer material and some additives , which act as a mold release agent.	11.5614484493498
Now , this is this is similar to having b o c o o.	7.212977332966716
Now , it , it has been generally found fortunately , that this effect is less compared to this , which means , for general step polymers when you go for higher and higher conversion , the rate of cyclization comes down because the k c , the value of k c comes down because of kinetic feasibility.	10.10118722790321
Similarly if you have a liquid , then if you apply strain stress , if i have a liquid glass of water , and then pour it , then it will basically flow it , if i remove the stress it does not come back to the original state.	9.368988981114233
We can we just talk about impact testing , impact basically is a dynamic loading at short duration.	9.89027834216608
So , styrene is stabilized monomer and styrene radical generated from styrene is a stabilized radical.	8.716504964898451
What do we expect with time conversion is , also you can write time , you know with more time.	10.700361325255763
So , having a knowledge of del h is very important for a chemical engineer.	10.65030233566119
The third and very commonly employed method is via activation of the functionalized carrier.	8.792365095999246
So the reactor performance is much better usually in the case of pfr.	9.189015186379281
In the case of single substrate reaction , that is what we have been talking so far , the life is simple because there is only one substrate and we are concerned with the binding of the substrate.	7.602573838668586
You can also have some standard solutions and this is a two way valve whereby you can either put a standard solution and measure observant in the photometer or you can put the actual cell and on the other side you have a buffer or a control solution which also passes through a delay line and a different photometer of the same wavelength and to empty the photometer tube pulses are used so that in a pulse mode the tubes are filled and emptied while the flow is continuous for the photometer measures in a pulse mode and the materials are removed.	10.692222565285235
As a polymer chemist , you probably what have to do , the processing part or the characterisation part but then you must know the techniques by which , the processing is done or the techniques or the different properties , and importantly the structure properties relationship between the property and the chemical structure.	9.89579447813672
That means if you consider very fine particles in which the pore diffusional resistances may be negligible or there are no substrate concentration gradient across the particle physical boundaries and that means reaction is taking place in the particle at the same rate in the bulk solution and that ratio is called effectiveness factor.	9.816957568954935
We will discuss today about , how the measurement techniques used for t g and t m , will not have detail discussion but the basic discussion , basic technique on determining t g and t m.	7.703855227448199
Now , if we have no scattering , or no scatter present in the medium , in the polymer material , and also there is no nothing which is absorbing.	9.995457489956948
So , the mobility of the polymer chains becomes very low below the glass transition temperature the mobility of the polymer segments is very low and they have no translation emotion there is no translation movement of the polymer molecules.	8.720262569821106
Anytime , at any point , p cannot be more than .	9.857020840737551
At the active site it is the real optimum temperature but in the bulk it is slightly higher because there is a gradient of temperature between the bulk.	10.746843094245655
It can also exist as total chloride ions in the case of a co - ordination complex.	8.00485576659201
I hope you got this concept of this ceiling temperature and how does it influence you polymerization process.	9.288089276976033
Today in the literature we will find probably a few thousand methods of immobilization and not that all of them have been commercially viable , because commercially viability is an issue which is linked directly to economics , the power of economics.	10.304831190946999
That is a very simplistic situation only to appreciate and understand the effect of ionization of the amino acid residue on the reaction rate.	8.253304380898637
For example , if we have two monomers and then copolymerize them in ball power solution , then compare their copolymerization behavior in heterogeneous polymerization system like emulsions or suspension.	8.921584779925084
If it is an ionizable carrier , charged carrier then only it will lead to a change in optimum ph as we will see subsequently.	8.94169588482625
Now , what do we see here in this experimental observation.	9.042026447548084
If you increase further , then t m goes down further.	7.393224252235931
They can be linked under certain conditions , under ambient condition so that their inactivation is not allowed and on those conditions aggregates of the enzymes can be made which can function as immobilized enzymes.	10.127804252445177
You again get another product form y and with the k4 rate constant.	9.674352137214205
For spherical particle jd is equal to jd = 1.625 ( nre ) - 0.507 this is one of the relationships which have been proposed but a large number of such empirical correlations are known.	10.30017380632739
Theoretically one can produce enzymes from any living source microbial , plant or animals but the trend in the reason past has been that the microorganism has been the preferred choice for variety of reasons.	10.73552435379093
Then phi i , which is the polymer fraction of the solvent molecule can be obtained from the number of moles.	12.86550016452414
This is ss , the substrate concentration on the surface and this goes down across the pore.	8.828310064849784
So this is part of initiation steps , this is propagation steps , and also we have termination step.	11.129078242017444
The binding part of the active site is demonstrated by the dissociation constant.	9.602661128018866
In case of mixture of proteins you can identify what proportion of the total protein is the enzyme molecule or what proportion of the total protein is the catalytically functional enzyme molecule and therefore protein concentration determination is important.	8.843310123432808
In fact if these enzymes can be used for those conversions which have very varied and very large commercial interest the impact will be much greater and one can be really fascinated with the industrial application of enzymes.	9.563346482166907
V0 = vm s / km + s that means the magnitude of this exponential is negligible.	10.583862602288338
So , what we do is take an isotropic scatterer; for example , say for organic solvent we can take a polystyrene about thirty k which is typically 5 nanometer; for typically lasers this is less than lambda by 2.	10.32724133248355
Whereas in the case of the induced fit mechanism once the enzyme active site is totally wrapped around the substrate , the reaction sites are not at all available for any other contaminant and therefore there is no chance of any other contaminant present in the substrate molecule to be able to interact with the enzyme molecule.	8.6199673329653
So , we cannot , that is the reason we cannot equate or put the same expression factor , in in case of radius of gyration as well , so we are putting a another expansion factor , in case of radius of gyration.	9.171626675290922
Another major advantage is the rapid termination of reaction.	7.450169727312267
So in case , the stiffness goes up , and as a result the t m goes up , and if you have , even bulkier group , then the t m goes up further.	8.233105453819768
There are problems still as far as the cost of the membrane is concerned the following operational problems.	8.906003511139074
But in the case of non - viable cells usually entrapment methods are the method of choice.	8.074450630342078
This is p.	15.583181170903746
Similarly on the other hand the internal flow diffusion also can be regulated by controlling the particle size.	8.64737260716694
But in most cases , carrier is a candidate which is required for a coupling of soluble enzyme onto an insoluble matrix.	9.62901687015811
Here the mode of charging and discharging of substrate is once.	8.467249696371413
This is well known to you guys , so you know that.	9.95566655396176
So , let us now compare few practical considerations.	7.514688749029179
There is a heater , two sample heater , e s supplies energy , they is a thermo couple , sample thermo couple t s.	9.368478310331232
So when this solution is brought in contact with the matrix , any carbohydrate matrix , cellulose has been a very commonly used matrix , then what happens is that these ligands are replaced by the hydroxyl groups present on the carbohydrate molecule.	8.733325378194202
So , this f is 1, f is 2, f is .	9.206746354412935
So , basically if you measure the time of reflux time of the solution and the solvent from the receiver , you can get the relative viscosity and from there you can get the reduced viscosity and inherent viscosity.	8.242439979955025
They can be parallel or anti parallel.	10.71199669111276
E binds to i with the dissociation factor of ki to form ei.	11.533510418138054
It is rate of polymerization , divided by rate of termination , or as steady state assumption , it is same as the radius of a rate of initiation.	10.315286704509774
So the immobilization to an anionic polymer will be able to give you a more stable preparation with respect to ph.	9.093162881833383
The reaction will continue , propagation will continue till your free monomer concentration becomes as the equilibrium free monomer concentration.	9.22659175080458
Otherwise if it was totally complementary without the strain then the reacting group will come down some where here and no reaction can take place.	9.013736808040065
Its not in the total enzyme because part of the enzyme has been recovered in the supernatant which if desired can be recycled.	13.355284728944792
Enzyme protein , as some of you may be aware , has enough number of ligand binding sites.	8.875277093839713
So , if you plot the conversion , we plot the conversion with time as more and more active micelle form or the polymerization takes place in more and micelle more and more my micelles.	8.97481344481871
So , all the polymers should be of similar size the will be lower , and they will be live all the time , so say the at the end of the polymerization , they will also be live.	9.179798833821206
In the case of a non - competitive inhibitor kesi will be equal to kei.	6.053722398154498
So , at some temperature which is higher than theta temperature , this excess term will become positive and you will start getting precipitation.	9.176210000109329
They consider specificity totally in isolation.	13.041796818588667
So , barriers polymers are having low permeability co efficient , and restricted passages of gases , vapors , and organic liquids.	10.147143810629938
So , now the definition is the classification is done by summation with conditions.	8.33526936170958
So , let us again for simplicity consider these tetramers are reacting with each other forming octamer.	8.483528848594386
Then came number of other developments and particularly the development with respect to the availability of analytical data on enzyme substrate binding.	9.812445982961394
So now , we completed our discussion on the polymers solutions and in phase separation.	10.341376309475661
So , it will be less than one intrusions by knowing that.	7.025128271520169
So , tight ion - pair or sometimes it is called contact ion - pair or see , some people say intimate ion - pair.	8.510474347976423
So , the high molecular of weight polymers in step growth polymers only form at the later stage , at the very late stage of the polymerization process.	8.919723392891076
When somebody who is in the market , who is practicing regularly that person which is practicing polymer scientist or polymer chemist is probably useful for them to you know , necessary for them to remember the trade names as well along with the the common name or the the names which typically used for the polymer molecules.	10.686712986456124
At the end of the reaction certain diamines are added so that this carboxylic group which is generated is neutralized and gets bound with the amino group and the preparation is neutral.	9.275457713262869
So , they are injected and their elution volumes are recorded and likewise calibration curve is constructed by injecting many mono dispersed polymer sample.	7.687844914992612
So , most of the surfactant molecules present at in this water medium as micelles , as you can appreciate that , because the surfactant concentration is quite high and cmc of the surfactants are quite low.	10.003079520311708
So , managing the heat , generate , generation or the heat generation during the polymerization is quiet not difficult.	9.915195304083822
So , we expect that instead of log size if we plot molecular weight we can get linear relationship between v e where elution with the size log m goes up , v e decreases.	10.55550262658095
So , you are polymer can be weather able are not depending upon , where it is used , which place , and which condition and so on.	8.098871066576175
So , what is unknown is k p by k t by half , so this is unknown quality , rest of the things we know from experiment.	8.577568968523057
You often end up getting a variety of profiles when we study ph.	10.548159389145292
Similarly , as in case of atip reaction or reaction , where i 0 can be replaced by the raft reagent concentration and the beginning and again try other cases , we can utilize this raft reaction reversible addition , fragmentation transfer reaction for making block polymer at the end of the polymerization if we add a second monomer.	9.293236472157101
So , this is very low.	4.288635355628348
So , the reaction can proceed without a termination reaction or and the reaction of the propagating chain can remain leaving.	9.101141638989862
The other parameter which is important in the case of kinetic parameter is change in k2 that is the turn over number or in other words you can say if you multiply with the enzyme concentration it becomes vm.	8.490493362382061
That means at the equilibrium k1 [ e ] [ s ] = k - 1 [ es ] and this by series of interpretations and using enzyme conservation equation , e0 = [ e ] + [ es ] the total enzyme concentration then , at equilibrium is distributed between enzyme substrate complex and free enzyme.	9.431368354783352
One of the major advantages , one of the distinct advantage for emulsion polymerization which is highlighted here is that unlike other radical polymerization , for a fixed monomer concentration the molecular weight can be increased without compromising the polymerization rate.	9.73154828897272
Generally , we compare in for polymer application.	11.852638765209319
See , if i have n is the number of kinetic chains , which means propagating radicals and of this a n , a is the fraction of this propagating radicals , undergoing termination by coupling.	9.175285481861208
Ultimately for any process application of the enzymes you need to engineer the systems even after you have done immobilization , even after you have studied the optimum reaction parameter , the whole systems has to be engineered.	12.117128293434613
If you want to identify or detect the deviation from ideality using the f curve then consider a cstr , a continuous stirred tank reactor and give a step change in the concentration of tracer in the feed stream.	8.274234090885136
If you have an isotactic polymer , them m and m m , both the dyad and tryad would be equals to .	8.511319460071727
In the case of chemical catalysis many of the catalyst are used in a heterogeneous phase , while the use of soluble enzyme will provide a homogenous catalysis.	9.338022844838603
Now let us talk about the three steps , initiation , in case of anionic polymerization are initiation.	6.868097371731934
That means an increase of magnitude by 1015 fold of the rate constant.	7.925701276809764
You will also notice that in many books it is written as ping - pong bi - bi mechanism.	9.089059017165907
So , this is the dilemma which molecular it should make , it will make high , very high molecular weight; your properties will be higher.	7.550415644308265
So , that is the result you get , so many , so many confirmations.	8.457977887743779
Second thing you can analyze the product , if the product is colored or if you by analyzing the reaction mixture of the end of the product at the end of the reaction we find there are new molecules.	10.72741040024461
See , if you compare the values typical this are the typical values now the values would be different for different monomers and solvent choices.	8.842724917638382
Plug flow reactors or in a much boarder sense you can say packed bed reactors are probably one of the most commonly used types of reactors in the immobilized enzyme applications mainly because of the nature of the catalyst.	10.60498983958095
So , what we can do.	4.227789358038872
If you have rigid backbone , then it is very difficult because that is why its polystyrene is a completely amorphous polymer.	8.957652848798427
Now because t f is very close to t i , we can simply write this expression at p 1 by p 1 0 as minus del h vaporization delta t e by r t i square.	9.5903572735701
This is very important in processing point of view , because while processing the polymers , are subjected to very high temperature.	8.521076982003136
So , next move to the ir spectroscopy , and as i mentioned , we will just mention the basic things about the spectroscopy , and then move to the application polymer science.	11.395454642609154
You can ignore or this size of size contribution due to this entering propagating radical is insignificant , so we can write chain degrees of polymerization that is in , and the polymerization is forming in a particle.	11.100622816008329
You know additional reaction means where monomers are just adding with each other and making polymers without elimination of small molecules.	8.300818305684718
So , the fact that it is not coming back to the original state , it is showing some loss of energy , some viscous behavior , and part of it is actually getting recovered , which is the behavior of a elastic solid , so that is the reason , it is a example of the visco elastic behavior.	9.84417120622507
And , how these are related.	9.511448252829213
So , this is the situation , i hope you are clear what at the beginning of the emulsion polymerization , now you start a polymerization that mean initiator is forming say radical.	8.10520706420293
We talk about non equilibrium , because when we introduce crystalinity in the polymers , the amount and the nature of the crystalinity depends upon how you are inducing the crystalinity , whether it fast or it slow.	10.39329841428142
Now , sometimes , experimentally it is found , then it is not a directly proportional to the power for initiator; it could be more than .	11.286713294608266
The maximum reaction velocity remains unchanged.	9.602259499066529
And you can get a isotactic polymer always.	9.402391333228655
It uses in a cycle and over a period of time.	6.451813399877696
Some of the trade names are shown here.	6.195133542862533
And if you can combine these two , you can get the critical entropy , the polymer solvent interaction parameter by this expression.	7.831296507863637
So this is also another set of monomers , which can be easily polymerized , by a anionic initiator.	8.517955833335488
So , what does it mean is that in any case of state polymerization , in any point of time whether you say small conversion or high conversion , what is the number of molecules which is present in maximum are the monomers because mono mass has the least number of structure units.	8.202879972708768
Your choice should depend upon the operational convenience.	16.1610761114074
Or in other words we are analogous to our classical michaelis menten constant for the substrate.	7.35084351224662
So , this is the number of molecules present at this , at this movement , any time during the reaction.	5.187321558438006
Then we have to design the monomers such a way that the equilibrium constant is pushed up or the reactivity increases.	7.699068275462048
There are two things one will always like to have a high substrate concentration for a reaction; for commercial purposes also we like to have a very high fraction of conversion and one would like to carry out the reaction almost to conversion levels of ninety five percent plus so as to achieve a complete conversion of substrate as much as possible so that the recovery and the purification stages are simplified or the product stream can be used as it is for end applications.	9.933543862016986
In most cases the immobilization has also resulted in some altered physico - chemical properties.	7.682910675093438
Another method , a very useful method , again for immobilizing mostly microbial cells is fiber entrapment.	10.570020570381262
However , if the because of the medium , if the availability of monomers are different , then they actually affect or they affect their availability in copolymerization.	12.505228113873768
So , if this they are same that is the best case where delta h m would be equals to .	8.602034083397252
Most of the process which are in use they are using adsorption onto clays , bentonite or some other clay; not any expensive or well defined matrices.	10.328569486453205
So , this is the expression we can utilize to get the number average molecular weight of a polymer from dilute polymer solution.	6.4638269000924575
So , basically this propagation and depropagation reaction , they reach in equilibrium.	6.897021871369673
Now this is having a , differently having a exothermic nature , this reaction.	8.631815090987182
Now , this type of monomers can be polymerized by cationic chain polymer , polymerization reaction because the resulting cationic propagating can be stabilized by the electron donating , mechanizing donation by the oxygen from here.	8.033872139185684
So , in this case there is a vacant d - rbital , which is available for complexation with the incoming monomer.	7.612363090893687
So , if you put all these numbers you will get , that e , e r coming around 40 kilo joule per mol.	7.02613029783383
Therefore the substrate will be available all across the particle and thus can be modified.	9.85150056839674
If suppose the enzyme particles are in the form of fibers or spherical beads , it is easier to pack them rather than putting in the cstr where there might be abrasion.	10.511895182897783
So , they actually , this dispersion molecule prevent this droplets to collide each other , and form a large particles.	9.131157404507432
There might be certain inhibitors present for the enzyme which might reduce the rate of reaction or there might be some proteolytic enzymes present and they can inactivate the enzyme protein.	8.78899192140161
So , if you will compare this number and the size , then total surface area total surface area of the micelles which will be much greater than the total surface area of the monomer droplets.	8.650279501528953
So , if i consider a molecule like , say , propylene and make polypropylene out of this; may be you can make a isotactic polymerization , you can make a isotactic polymer of from propylene molecule.	8.648799047643683
So , that is the expression which relates the number of average molecular weight with r , which is ratio of the moles of two bi - functional monomers present in the system at the beginning , where r is defined such a way that it is always less than equals to 1 and p is the conversion which is defined as the fraction of the functional groups which is present in a smaller quantity as reacted.	8.832114584129409
Whatever has to be hydrogenated it can be used.	12.350444516993225
On the other hand when sb is very small or a first order regime , if you look at the this equation from here you get v = k2e0 / km ( sb - v / klam ) or if you simplify and take all the v term onto the left hand side you will get k2e0 klam . sb v = km klam + k2e0 you can simplify or 1 / v for small sb will be equal to 1 km 1 v = ( + ).	9.254954043072363
So , for example , if i write this; it can give up electron in a anion den can produce radical in a electorate.	8.014916060876647
For example , we have talked that in first case , if your r 1 r 2 is 1 is gives us ideal copolymerization.	8.738930082231272
And also in case of polymer specially in case of this the polymers which are sold in large quantities they have trade names.	11.460490524449149
The ph will be a very major parameter which will affect the binding in the case of ionic binding.	10.292082673790821
Vm . s vi = km / ( 1 + i / ki ) + s ( 1 + i / a ki ) km ( 1 + i / ki ) ( 1 + i / a ki ) 1 / vi =.	5.630074375944734
Now , what we will do in next 5 - 10 minutes is just to give the summary or recollect your memory , basically the most important points of the radical chain polymerization which we discussed in that 5 - 6 - 7 class lectures.	9.06922490718477
One of the mechanisms by which enzyme function is that the bond between the a and the central carbon atom gets distorted or strained , such that the binding gets facilitated to the x.	9.923275186281035
And also we need to very careful about that we have to run as many as can in the nmr as possible , this spectra more quantitative the lesser , the number of scam the error the more will be error in the in the composition.	10.641559346559156
The reaction is exothermic and lot of heat is generated.	9.683898666067838
The stability of the preparation and protection from microbial attack.	9.498478261081766
How the reactor performance will change.	12.048042997052464
Example of r br is 1 phenyl ethyl bromide and l is 4, 4 di 5 nonyl 2 2 dash by pyridine.	11.375568734648644
So , then the rate of cyclization also should increase in that process.	9.765192036350602
So , in case of fire resistance material , flame property it should not burn , if it burns , it should not drip and ignite other inflammable material , and third it should not generate toxics smokes.	9.591211940164245
Therefore he also considered that the second step in the sequence is also reversible.	11.809359776877322
We can get m w from the intercepts or intercepts for c is equal to 0 and theta equal to 0, and we can get z average radius of gyration which can be converted to weight average radius of gyration , and we can get information of a 2 which will anyway give information about the polymer solvent interaction parameter.	8.623055771588785
And typically , for the monomers which we know undergo polymerization process , this equilibrium value of the free monomer concentration is very low.	7.684855987416748
Now , we do not consider normally the reverse reaction because the temperature , we do for most of the monomers , the reverse reaction is almost nil , that is why , we always talk about rate of forward reactions.	9.700236752084708
In a living cell the concentration of the two substrates that are to interact with the enzyme may be almost in an equal or near by concentration levels.	10.16845113621082
Space time is kept constant over the reactor operation , over a period of time t and only the fractional conversion is declining from x0 to xt and this gives you the reactor performance or the effect of operational stability on the reactor performance in cstr.	9.834213682973612
Reactor the minimum . . . velocity and all those properties must be identified for a particular immobilized enzyme preparation and then we report any method.	12.393871217029515
When you increase the polarity by adding ethylene dichloride , dichloethane , eu , say in 40 - 60 mixture , your dielectric constant goes up , your reaction goes up.	8.876273228632527
Now , depending on the association behavior of these two species , the active center and the counter ion , the reactivity of the propagating species varies.	9.645833276727798
Next point is , you know , stoichiometric ratio r should be close to .	8.388621487198938
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry , and today we are going to move from of discussion , on step growth polymers to chain growth polymerization.	5.710324785252449
Today we shall discuss about some of the issues and the future directions of enzyme technology that we are likely to face in near future.	10.666652227597506
When we talk about specific activity higher the specific activity , enzyme is catalytically better.	9.541420878790092
In many cases it can still explain the whole theory or whole requirements of specificity.	8.268337123565903
One is to one plus these things plus some mono - functional monomer which is chain stopper.	9.51703895688731
You will make this the copolymer at the beginning , you will get more numbers m 2 is getting incorporated in the polymer copolymer chain , but the m 2, addition of m 2 m 1 will be complete random.	9.554772283050262
Now , how many molecules are there in x mar.	8.747232845087261
At t c you have r , r p is same as r d p now r p you know k p m and m dot and this will be m dot.	10.158073529236175
When i say proteins we immediately understand a chain of amino acids.	7.429323508332187
As i said there have long tail , hydrophobic tail and because of this , they migrate to the surface and and form a lubricating layer.	8.77419769741761
You can build high molecular weight.	5.95519883215745
If f is 1, molecular weight distribution would be , say , if i take this molecule , just one , one of functional group and obviously , it will be , we discussed that earlier , it will be like a linear polymerization with presence of small amount of monofunctional group.	11.020702521403672
If you look at this expression if this contributes negatively , obviously mu 1 this difference would be lower than the ideal.	7.853948900853238
Now , this , these are complex reactions as we will find out from further discussion , that these are complex reaction and they are very fast.	9.452371094843988
It is the second variant coefficient from which is related to polymer solvent interaction parameter and m is the molar mass.	9.423487791531512
This ionization state will affect the maximum reaction velocity of the enzyme because ultimately you are affecting the total effective enzyme concentration which is in the true ionisable state of the system.	9.538340470988006
So , this is the number of ways this i th chain i th polymer chain can be placed in the 3d lattice.	5.654568107457137
So , basically this is example of m n and m w expressed in integral form; this shows why we require the raw data to be transformed in this type of weight fraction molecular distribution with plot of weight fraction versus molecular weight.	7.246336448651755
So , this is poly ether ether ketone , this is polyether ketone , this is poly bisphenol a polyether sulfone and this is simply called polyether sulfone.	11.494516396404512
We will take some other example.	7.732471208147567
Now , we have to find out n which is the number of molecules at time t at some reaction if conversion is p.	7.922477207601327
And then we will follow up our discussion with a phase separation behavior of polymer solutions.	6.788545094403091
Where there is no substrate involved only simple rate constant can be written and similarly wherever et is going to form the product in the reverse direction , the product concentration will be incorporated the inter conversions of the enzyme forms involved in each step must be described by a term called kappa.	10.741091787498165
If you can carry out the reaction in a very nonpolar medium like hydrocarbon , and if we have a counter ion which is small in size , so that they will be tightly bound.	9.50224065410225
And then we talk about the inhibition and retardation reactions , we talk about how to determine or what is the procedure of determination of different reaction rates , rate of initiation , rate of termination rate of polymerization.	10.294667020108829
Now , this is what we are discussing the static light scattering technique.	7.344408140855471
Because , 1 kinetic chain is getting broken down to 1 dead polymer and a another kinetic chain , which means , this is a chain breaking reaction.	9.815991472678752
How the testing is done.	8.37942113645298
Then it can be a cyclic input in the waveform and then output also will be some type of a cyclic output.	11.015738686705745
Now , hcl does not take part in reaction with the polyester , whether it is cyclic or linear polyester , which means , that in this case there is no equilibrium present between the cyclic and the linear polymer molecule.	9.071259644152468
Some of the important characteristics of these preparations is that only reactions involving relatively small substrate or product molecules can be carried out successfully using entrapped enzyme preparations.	9.510039022441019
Or , we can decompose this hydro , hydro peroxides by non radical path ways.	12.066801788457195
These individual monomers are not very useful , when we discuss or copolymerization reaction.	11.329166110687275
Therefore they are called apparent parameters and in all possible analysis we must be interested in the apparent parameters , kappm.	11.237226112369994
Instead of spending more time on this table , which we will discuss in more detail when we discuss the individual techniques , let us move to the actual techniques.	9.58881519777608
So , it is very difficult always to attribute one change in value of glass transition temperature , t g for a particular reason.	8.009994025805636
So , for this type of initiation , we can write r p is m , fie i a by k t , to the power half.	6.789318578500291
In this expression we are writing for the formation of the enzyme species e.	10.890790615582489
So i think we will stop at this point.	4.75696172635356
Similarly , if we write the equation for theta equals to 0 line , we get this and if we only dealing with very dilute solution , and if you ignore this higher terms.	9.735833393075687
Now , that indicates that , now that indicates that; see if we , if the rate of polymerization dependent not directly , not to the power 1, but more than 1 select 3 by 1.5; which means , that this monomer also taking part in generating radicals.	10.190503629477105
We can also go to a level that not all the enzyme is saturated; all the enzyme is not bound , bulk of the enzyme is still available in the free form.	10.630595547789097
Excess unreacted salt is washed with buffer.	14.786871323212111
So , you basically get homogenous polymers.	7.052231063683286
Energy of activation is energy required for the catalytic part.	10.14796277870801
If you have non - polar medium they will become very tight ion pair.	8.389336542675878
There is nothing more to understand and it is just for information purpose.	10.10095244690453
Processing condition; now , we must know the processing condition of the polymer for which we want to use the additive; now , that will that will give the temperature of use and the amount of share.	13.66049413386351
To start with any kinetic analysis one needs to initiate with some basic experimental observations and to take some experimental observations the key parameters that are usually involved in the study are the enzyme concentration , substrate concentration , product concentration , concentration of inhibitor or activator if there is one where as enzyme , substrate and product are the universal chemical species involved in the case of an enzyme catalyzed reactions.	10.512132914627328
The situation which i have shown here is rather too simplistic.	11.190272815010253
That means you take reciprocals on both the sides of the expression.	7.447058401416107
For example we identify let us say the mass transfer limitations are the most acute.	10.35512289201615
So , what it essentially means.	7.450341220715856
That means you have a polymeric gel matrix and an enzyme molecule is entrapped within the lattices or interstitial spaces of these gel just by physical confinement.	9.753834693014744
Otherwise this value will be this magnitude although they will have a relationship but they will be a function of other substrate concentration.	11.076265156624098
Assuming , that they are close to 1is to one or whatever target molecular rate you are looking for , that has to be the same what you are giving.	12.229330232408328
In a dynamic balance.	9.786756272486455
But michaelis menten equation is still considered to be the universal model for analyzing the enzyme catalyzed reactions.	8.447259537590286
So to summarize we have seen the effect of two major environmental parameters which are experienced by the enzyme catalyzed reaction the first is ph.	10.367397356891718
Now , what are the practical considerations in case of , say , cationic chain polymerization.	8.00680377008649
That means the use of immobilized enzymes as industrial biocatalyst in the industries.	7.737220421035606
And in case of semi crystalline polymer , deformation at crystallographic scale crystal state so , polymer chains might sleep with respect in the direction of the applied stress or it could move in the perpendicular director direction.	9.275962037635383
So , total number of way is then.	7.106328456001844
Whereas from the enzyme substrate complex to transition state is a totally different phenomenon and the energy required to go from an enzyme substrate complex to transition state is the amount of activation energy required for the reaction.	8.571813090079212
This was for external catalyst , this was self catalyst.	9.243155486565373
Just like in the case of ph effects on the deactivation of enzyme , temperature is also mediated by inactivation process.	8.433262698408324
Now , will talk about copolymer form position , now in most cases what happened , because we are mixing m 1 and m 2, and you are copolymerizing form there.	10.197098365410044
So , if you what to work in the lab or if you join in the industry you should be able to know what are the complete list of criteria , you know we have gone in last lecture to carry out a successful step polymerization.	8.837070397138055
Similar also true for high , high rings with size of 7, 8 carbon.	10.978278310418201
So , it is a stress is given by force so , stress is forced by area.	8.733315785144152
Temperature also can control the degree of polymerization and all the parameters can be optimized for a given condition so that the maximum yield of the enzyme activity is recovered at the end of the reaction.	9.743956765109703
Wherever you see water molecules , for example these ones they may be replaced by enzyme molecules.	11.112661507966282
As i mentioned earlier the thiele modulus is a function of the true rate constant , the substrate concentration on the surface and the effective diffusivity and physically if you look at , the thiele modulus gives you an indication although its not an exact ratio but it really gives you a ratio between the two reaction rate or reaction rate parameters to that of rate of diffusion.	9.296313510620264
E k1 k4 k - 1k - 4 ea eb k - 2 k - 3 k2 eab e + x + y there will be rate constant at this state k1, k - 1, k2, k - 2, k3, k - 3, k4 and k - .	9.385282371527317
Look at the transmittance t m , or transmission electron micrographs , these black portions are the siloxane domains , and the background is the bpa pc.	11.555139012109432
So , let us see whether it get clarified to you in this cartoon.	7.826032361828403
The ionization of the residue can be considered as k eh e - + h + that is the neutral enzyme , which is a protonated enzyme can dissociate into the negatively charged enzyme and the protons with the ionization constant of k.	10.651881513457775
Up to a concentration range the rate of reaction is proportional to the enzyme concentration.	8.738646364678734
We don t get any insight into the correctness of the data.	10.456070788888121
And i tried to give emphasize on the polymerization or synthetic process which are important , which are used very frequently or which are more important industrially.	10.285594574719175
In fact although industrially such systems are not very commonly employed as far as the academic study is concerned these systems have been applied.	9.81627686409813
So , if you have like typically in a linear polymer we have two ends and if they hit the branch and it has three ends , then obviously we must know that this case the sample has two chain ends end groups and this case the sample has three end groups; otherwise the analysis will be erratic with error in the values.	9.713486689920117
L less than one and f is equal to one the reaction velocity of immobilized enzyme will become equal to vime = k2 p . f.s . es / km that means in the first order regime if you substitute in this parameter kappm = km / pf you get such an expression where f is equal to zero at.	10.136267052468673
And butylene glycol group butylene glycol group always next to each other will we expect that or will you expect that there be will random copolymers.	9.911266689142968
This alpha helix and other type of conformation which many proteins will have will be again as the result of hydrogen bonding will be in the form of beta pleated sheet.	9.699059082095168
In other words we are developing a strain onto the substrate molecule so that the substrate molecule reacting groups are coming in proximity to the catalytic site.	9.442948687045497
The substrate concentration is high enough but again this is not identical to the vm of the michaelis menten equation because vm of the michaelis menten equation is an asymptotic value.	8.804460480606071
On the other hand in the case of michaelis menten kinetics when the emrel and s0 are comparable , it will vary and it will be a function of km; what the magnitude of km is in comparison to substrate concentration.	8.285837723837174
H value of the reaction is not very high so that there is no temperature gradient in the reaction; the first assumption.	11.301140160266078
Whereas , molecule like styrene can be easily polymerized to a very low equilibrium value of free monomer in the mixture.	9.772517634278788
Now this require , this is like this titanium transition metal in zeigler - natta polymerization , this requires another co - catalyst like alkyl aluminum as is in the case of zeigler - natta polymerization.	9.531064182382263
So , as the reaction progresses , as p progresses , k c comes down.	5.988504178619373
So , 100 is the value of kinetic chain length that means , 100 monomers has , in a average every chain before termination on average every chain before it undergoes termination reaction , which we call kinetic chains has a number of monomer units of 10.	10.532928584772156
We have seen just now , that in earlier today , that it is always preferred to have a monomer present in high concentration , so that we can reduce the cyclic formation.	9.542161930140308
Continuing from the previous lecture on kinetics of bi - substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions we will be talking about the application of king altman method to derive rate expression for some of the complex enzyme reaction mechanisms that we often encounter in the bi - substrate reactions.	9.710268817866647
The dissolved oxygen electrode will measure dissolved oxygen only; it cannot measure glucose directly.	10.912740038615276
The concept of buffers was in a very primitive stage.	11.46796903952066
So , theoretically from fractional equation; the maximum transparence is given by this , where n is the refractive index of the polymeric media.	10.278149118589031
M n m should put down concentration monomer should go down , so r p go down slowly , so it go down slowly.	11.37472817626888
We know that increasing the linear flow velocity will influence the kl value.	8.803473869578141
And as i said for high molecular weight polymer p is .	8.005450735040288
So , higher cohesive energy density means higher attraction between the molecules.	7.810697612328965
In this case , i go back this and write the molecular weight distribution again without going into the derivation where x w y x n is given by 1 plus f r p.	9.07302838706219
Now this cross a similar to the vapor liquid equilibrium of ideal liquid mixtures , so that is why , that is from where this name of ideal has come.	10.811914903270225
For examples like methylmethacrylate acrylamide , vinyl chloride , acrylonitrile vinyl acetate , etcetera can be very easily polymerizable , by a radical initiator.	9.675883911663835
That means if this anylate has to recognize this biological unit there must be an affinity between the two.	8.978386933342502
Now , to know the anti oxidant additives which are used , let us discuss the basic autoxidation scheme for a minute.	9.670520664170215
In this lecture , we will talk about the importance of copolymerization , and then copolymer composition equation , and then go into different types of copolymerization process , and resulting different microstructure of copolymer , and then talk about composition drift , and monomer reactivities , and then corresponding the effect of chain initiation reaction on monomer reactivities.	10.489536139068026
Ultimately when you will measure the enzyme activity you will see that the enzyme activity is low because per unit enzyme loading the activity which will be expressed by the immobilized enzyme particle will be lower.	11.153038121681421
It could be due to that resulting polymers have because because have a strong association.	9.009720004063405
In non - polar medium what happens.	7.075546489017671
Now , this are the data of all the 3 del g gibbs free energy change enthalpy change and entropy change.	9.677752701333729
So , we take the solubility parameter of that particular solvent as the solubilitic parameter of the given polymer.	7.90397182818279
They actually contribute to char conformation , and which actually suppress there , is basically prevent supply of this compostable gases , to this pyrolysis zone , and just by decreasing the met flammability.	11.229692936398024
And if there a optical homogeneities just beneath the surface; obviously , the amount of light scattered , reflected will be different , and the gloss will come down.	9.328213579508581
So , you are requested , if you are interested you can go and read a or consult a specialized book on polymer synthesis to know more about this polymerization techniques.	9.28279143435841
So , they are frozen.	7.4562921195226295
So , this calibration can be used to get true molecular.	7.436010799496035
Finally to conclude i would like to say that today we have discussed the characteristic features of enzymes that are attributed by proteins nature , as a macromolecule in terms of assay method , their ionic behavior , their conformation , solubility and the role these properties play in the various techniques that are used for isolation , purification or application of these enzymes.	10.74174796666234
So , we now have the measurements done for all the solutions at different angles.	8.851210771344446
Now , what is metallocene polymerization.	6.525893166586745
Rate of polymerization nothing but rate of disappearance or rate of consumption of monomers , now if this new radical formed for transfer reaction , they also consuming monomer in the same rate.	11.747007235687345
What about this.	11.68880206528622
Let me write in a fresh paper.	9.90870620609503
For example consider a protein chain in which you have amino acid like aspartic acid.	8.377819784859462
The substrate is now localized for the reaction at the active site whatever is the volume of active site in a given enzyme molecule.	10.1102322861798
So , this expression is which we derived using 3d lattice model should be quite justifiable.	7.8555905883531585
So , as i expected with increasing p , you have x also increases , molecular poly molecular also increases , but if you plot with fraction , you can see this is not the monomer features.	11.317940048935403
So , you can if you deform up to this point and then , remove the stress , it will come back to the original state.	7.0139705802899375
But we will consider only those patterns which will consist of n - 1 steps.	7.943406168542698
The free active site on the free enzyme molecule without interaction with the substrate has its particular configuration where the catalytic sites and binding sites are distantly located.	11.878748811956829
Similarly in the case of pfr , because the enzyme loading is very high usually in pfr , a large fraction of the reactor also experiences a low substrate concentration.	8.995988430780558
That means some amount of energy is released by this binding and the enzyme substrate complex instead of starting from the level of ground state of a and b now has reached to a state little higher than ground state by binding process and from there it goes to the bound state.	10.30822787060585
We , the effect of pressure is not that significant for addition polymerization.	10.183479824971064
K - 3.p and the fraction of the et of the total enzyme concentration will be e0 ( k2.k - 3p + k1.k2s + k - 1.k - 3.p ) now you can write the reaction velocity.	9.452972002794784
But one of the major reason is that most of the enzyme reactions are inhibited if not very excessively but mildly by product concentration.	9.030223919239546
As a matter of fact practically there are hardly any reactions , very few reactions , which are single molecular.	8.612579772149717
If you plot 1 / a and 1 / v you get a profile like this with b varying and if you plot slope vs 1 / v and similarly intercept versus 1 / v you can determine the value of ka , kb , k a and vm.	8.875083046420977
One is syndiotactic and atactic formation and from experiment data we get this around minus 4 to minus 8 kilo joule per mole and this we get around 0 to 4 joule per mole.	9.517038421526939
Now , we are writing ki for this reaction because it has been found out , that of these two reactions , this is the two reactions , consists of chain reaction , chain initiation reaction.	9.930250366804193
Today even design of an enzyme protein , modifications for tailoring it to give some desirable property is a job which can be taken up only with the help of computational science.	11.0542215777178
There is no interference by binding of substrate or inhibitor onto the enzyme in their subsequent binding process.	9.25803622148371
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
From this expression we can know , that if f average is higher , more than 2, then for given p value , given conversion we will get a higher molecular weight , higher degrees of polymerization in comparison to linear polymer.	10.68103945781001
Just one more time plastics are polymers , but not all polymers are plastics.	10.186707220185745
You know all the term here , f r p plus 1 minus r p square and at r is equal to 1, p is .	9.695184222652761
Then with this total segments and the solvent molecules were placed in the 3d lattice like the small molecules.	8.759389542310922
We define it as analogous to the dissociation constant , km.	10.734850682142559
And again , you can break down this expression in the two terms , one temperature independent and another temperature dependent.	9.868939332780927
So , with this , this page shows that for a given radical reaction , you know this r 1 and r 2 values are almost same.	8.714770265712442
If there are impurities , which can undergo side reaction , do chain transfer reactions , then there molecular build up is a problem and these reactions , because oxygen is also a.	9.427971131623707
Theoretically this concept of orientation was considered that the enzyme is able to steer the reactants into a correct orbital alignment at the active site and therefore this effect was also called as orbital steering.	11.026437592713792
This is applicable for methylene groups and also , this ether are the backbone , the cycling and ether other carboxylic groups , carbonic groups.	9.719447611170024
Molecular also influence the value of t m , this , because as you have seen in case of t g as well , that if we the chain ends are having much more free volume , so the end of polymer chains are much more flexible.	12.263952472649917
So , same time the collision frequency between the molecules coming down because of size being higher , but the collision frequency between the functional groups , they are becoming more.	8.757375446109055
The chain can terminate , the chain can transfer to compounds , added compounds , which are having active hydrogens.	12.08250997955555
So if you consider a process , typically what happened , there is always the delta is neighbor is zero , because there is always a difference between , difference in the heat capacity between the sample , and the reference.	9.721855728050668
Now , there are few exceptions , there are actually very few exception , one example is the reactions with diacid chlorides.	9.572966159691758
This is a montmorillonite clays , which is very commonly used nanoclay and they have enlayered two dimensional structure and so , ideally to get the best property from the clay as a filler , they has to be dispersed quit well.	10.575998632121426
If you consider as a first order process then the half life of this that means the time it takes to reach the fifty percent of the original value is half life.	9.201703803351082
Now , with this , i stop for this lecture , i will just continue the mechanical property in the next lecture with little more discussion.	7.973340072927374
On the other hand if you look at the kinetic pattern of thermal deactivation , the thermal deactivation is also very common situation , because in most cases it can be understood that the enzyme is more stable in the presence of a substrate.	7.7624895826600016
You have to take the monomer and a initiator which is soluble in the monomer.	8.604173842854657
The question is how to analyze a practical situation.	11.246440102291773
The dissociation constant for binding of inhibitor to enzyme may be different from the dissociation constant for inhibitor binding to es complex and there might be an interaction factor of alpha.	10.04305043267296
Similarly , if the entropy denies term , can be reduced , then the t g goes up.	7.227997058650844
Now this polymer every monomer unit can stay as cis 1, 4 polymer which gives; you can write like this.	8.792658530121962
Now , i will give a proper structure , so that you get.	8.263281180551346
Only difference is that between the bulk and the surface where the reaction is taking place there is concentration gradient and ideally if the diffusion control has to be out of picture in that case the concentration gradient should not be large and this concentration can be reached if you assume that there is no substrate consumption at the surface.	9.618408702494905
So , if you choose 2 sets monomer from 2 different sets , then they will form alternate copolymer.	7.242743048945155
So , you know that there are three states possible for a matter.	7.479673045309951
So , i write n 0 by n , n 0; i can rearrange this to get n 0 by n as 1 by 1 minus p.	6.77647706766158
In such cases when all the catalytic sites on the enzyme molecule , even look at its different subunits , if they are identical and non - interacting or non - cooperative , they have no interaction among each other.	9.686289795144349
The reason that we cannot get the calibration curve made for all the polymers , because we cannot get narrow dispersed polymer for all types of polymers; specially , for coordination polymers , for polycarbonate polyesters , polyamides that is very difficult to synthesize narrow dispersed polymers which spi is 1.1 or less than that it is very difficult; and unless we have a narrow dispersed or mono dispersed samples which can be retry standards we cannot use this for calibration.	10.79486845425242
So , these are the mechanism by which they work.	6.523736367523191
We should consider sh + because that is the form of substrate concentration which is the total substrate concentration for all practical purposes.	11.39739136859389
I will try to explain the same points with a particular example of oxidation of a d - amino acid , using d - amino acid oxidase where you have this amino group which undergoes reaction.	9.910728868025808
That is what we mean by identical binding sites.	6.932817446973533
So , we are not writing the first step , first addition.	6.658226612872873
So basically in the instrument , we try to detect the scatterings only from the solute molecule in this case the polymer molecule in a dilute solution so that there are not much intermolecular interactions and we deduct the scattering which we detect for or determine from a solute solution from the solvent so that we can get the information of on scattering from only from the solute molecules.	9.111258744044179
If the rate of diffusion or molecular diffusivity is very high also.	10.90496835353669
So , how many chains they have.	6.375654699478007
Either the product can inhibit competitively or non - competitively.	11.83238603444071
If the e - is the active form , not the neutral enzyme in that case although.	11.168521071144593
Because of , presences of pdms , it migrate to the surface and because of , hydrophilic nature of polycapton electron , it basically form a domains of hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.	9.677617110365334
Termination reactions , now let us consider the true termination reaction , which is the combination of the cationic propagating species with the counter ion.	9.498986279853566
So , u x is square 1 minus p square p x minus 1 and if you solve this , you will get , we get x bar is 1 plus p 1 minus p.	8.503295822955302
It is a dithio ester.	10.4123180471503
Now , you can always go through any detailed publications or in a detailed text book where you will find out the detail you know detail method of making this polymers.	9.347863732728543
That means there will be some condensate remaining in the system , polymerization system.	9.209973679472784
One of the essential features for study of enzyme kinetics is the experimental data.	7.47407103346548
A similar concept has to be developed for co - enzyme retention in the reactor.	10.354369214568456
So , let us go through and look this basic.	7.189788367517202
Resulting polymers is have much higher strain compared to if there was no such bulky groups.	10.14883802053478
That means you assume that the substrate diffuses into the particle in the form of a cylindrical pore.	8.116033370408019
That means enzyme activity to carrier ratio is varied and at different combinations you allow equilibrium to be formed and under equilibrium condition you measure the concentration of the enzyme in the liquid phase and also in the solid phase.	9.351212624468092
Each segment s intermediate actually has z minus 2, one this side and one this side.	9.844118171022668
And , this 2 can be added together , sometimes to have a synergistic benefit for engineering plastics.	9.746811176016225
So , if you can find out theoretically , what will be the extent of reflection , then we can find out , what will be maximum transparency , of any material or a plastic material , and that is theoretically given by fractional equation.	8.607391363832194
If this happens , the reactions become very complicated and we call that sometimes isomerization polymerization as well.	8.548601620998673
The hydrie initiator you should choose such a way that the reactions happened in the model rate , so that the temperature which you are planning to reaction or rather you choose your polymerization reaction temperature such a way that the half life of your initiator is somewhat between , say your reaction time frame.	9.777032414257823
So , we know almost everything; what we need to know to construct a zimm plot.	8.377892753579003
Ss is the substrate concentration of the surface and m is the order of reaction whatever the order of reaction and de is the effective diffusivity.	13.218653103636518
You can imagine that it is it is a 3d lattice.	8.968409206538544
That is a definition of immobilized enzymes.	7.468098785072161
Let us compare another set of polyamides; same class of polymers.	7.011571092487635
So , the termination reaction becomes diffusion control the higher is the diffusion higher is the termination reaction , but because the medium viscosity is quit high , so diffusion rate is low.	8.515805095830553
So , as more and more reaction is happening , more and more get , heat get generated , but fortunately the exothermicity or the amount of heat generated for in a step growth polymerization is not high.	9.791708784076338
So , the modulus of glass is high because , the strain rate or the the stresses are applied is not in a higher rate you know , very fast rate.	9.113059169648992
So , now , this can be we can put this value of r p here , so we can get k p m by twice k t r p at steady state , so if you know tau s we know k p by r p.	9.219409016214993
So , you can create in this way macromonomer , which you can utilize for further polymerization.	7.38338558112893
It makes no difference if you go to the carrier bulk of the cost is already paid and and this is another example where immobilized enzymes are used commercially and in very large quantities.	11.920925498585552
Typical values of e d for thermal initiation process come about 120 to 150 kilo joule per mol , e p comes on 20 to 40 kilo joule per mol and e t is 2 to 20 kilo joule per mol , these are the experimental values.	9.109162743713748
It is only the loss of activity because of the conformational changes.	8.690215828863492
We have already made the polymer.	7.125116930398985
And from either this or this radical both of the , which her resitable radical.	9.978487598335427
So with this , we conclude the discussion on determination of molecular weight by viscosity method.	10.268100895838145
How do you get a high value of x n.	8.027002883596758
Now , most cases as we learned by now that for a high molecular weight polymer , p is close to .	7.496804607418899
So from that point of view , understanding their interaction is quite important.	9.783901313078726
The other acrylitic families are poly methyl acrylitic acids , polyacrolomite poly acrylic acid and poly acronitral.	10.263862644035258
So , this one example where chemical engineers is restricted by the limitation of the reactor design , where the condensate can be taken out to a limited level , but still that will be not be sufficient to build up the molecular weight , enough molecular weight.	9.445461419604406
That is they can be non - porous.	13.150997668629188
So , in a general , in case of semi crystalline thermo plastic material , you have; first you have heat distortion temperature , the softening temperature.	7.962250035350735
So , k t multiplied by m dot square.	7.6993895238946495
Two factors which contribute to the reduction in activation energy or the efficiency of the enzymatic catalyst are : one is binding of the substrate and other is complementary of the enzyme molecule to that of the transition state.	9.003380524627222
The next stage which is again very important is to look at the ionization of substrates because it is not only important that the enzyme may ionize it may also be very commonly feasible that when you are handling the charged substrate molecules and very often the protein itself is a substrate which is a poly electrolyte and it will have many functional groups which will be ionisable.	11.697902539131206
So , basically if i want to compare , differentiate where you have a stabilized radical and a not stabilized monomer , stabilized radical plus a stabilized monomer , a not stabilized radical and not stabilized monomer , not stabilized radical and a stabilized monomer.	8.714772908210218
Enzyme does not pass through but substrate or product must be able to pass through the membrane in the system.	9.1096867599713
That situation will not apply here , if you analyze.	15.120414059114806
All those functions are a key part of the living cell and all these functions are attributed to the function of enzymes and that is where we get to understand enzymes in a more detail fashion.	11.902757396407006
There could be some peroxides or hydro peroxides , which also when act as a initiator , they participated in chain transfer reaction and resulting decrease of molecular weight , example of x a is monomer methyl methacrylate dot , it is not the methyl methacrylate.	10.23983271176554
Similarly here this imino carbonic acid complex instead of reacting with the enzyme molecule can react with hexamethylene diamine which provides you free amino groups and the hexamethylene diamine will attach here or instead of giving an immobilized enzyme , you will be getting - chohch - o - conh - ( ch2 ) 6nh.	11.582398817313488
Now , as you have seen we discussed the radical polymerization is done mostly for the double bond containing monomers , but not all the monomers which contain the double bond can be polymerized radically , and that depends on both the thermo dynamic and kinetic factor.	9.416952573663469
The product formation with es will be e + p.	10.286390931465029
All the reagents , which are using monomers and initiator must be extremely pure , there should not be any other impurities because anionic , anionic , carboanions are very reactive , so they can , they can actually get react , they can actually react with the impurities and get terminated.	10.758135721166793
Now we said , that when we talk about homo polymers , now we can have only limited , number of homo polymers you know , we always using , if you have noticed same names basically coming , every time polystyrene , polyaclonoidal , polygon acetate , polymethyl like.	10.90970445531686
Natural resource derived monomers.	14.128856415295584
And the more the shielding , more is the effective; less is the effective external magnetic field the nuclei experience.	10.378699376189205
Why is it.	14.867480444818645
Now , if you get the value for this form this equilibrium , we can write ki i yz m.	9.061839115104783
So , with these we will move to we will basically completed our discussion on radical copolymerization , we will move and discuss very briefly about ionic copolymerization.	8.495680808970484
It is assumed that any given protein contains approximately 16 % of nitrogen.	10.292070439959467
Now , this is for thermal initiator; it is given by , r p is given by k t , k p , m , r i; r i is twice f k d i , twice k t to the power half.	6.429839065946112
Now in this case also , this can get stabilized by resonance , and this will form this.	9.343322894505416
So , they can act as inhibitor or retarder in case of cationic chain polymerization , like we talked about different retarder or inhibitor , like in case of radical chain polymerization.	7.690431967372467
Typically we can go up to 10 to the power difference of temperature between the two thermistor as low as 10 to the power 4 kelvin which translate to upper limit of the upper limit of the molecular weight m n , upper limit of m n approximately 10 to the power 4 order gram per mol.	8.853522754722402
You can calculate degree of polymerization from the number of tetramer and dimers present divided by total number of total molecules present in the system.	9.381098024488393
That means at the saturation level you are assuming that the entire enzyme is bound to the substrate.	6.859380258130936
It will land up in a , demerit will land up in a diametric state.	8.290014677447285
Usually we take a protein , hydrolyze it by using some enzymes or chemical means by acid or alkali and monitor the different amino acids that are produced.	10.09469086924691
So , this is viscosity average molecular weight.	4.067841858773635
The third approach of analyzing the diffusional limitation is on the basis of activation energy.	8.35476789348158
In the case of non - competitive inhibition it can bind to either e or es and the dissociation constant is identical.	6.923915935575759
The effect of ph is linked to the ionization state of the enzyme active site.	7.31708824052401
The entrapment of cells is much more because of their larger size than the enzyme molecule.	9.647691830728895
And if you know also , that if it is in high temperature and if there is a presence of oxygen , then thermo duration is a , is a very feasible way of degrading any organic molecules.	10.370507227087078
This can also be written as vi = vm s / km + s + s2 / ks if you plot such profile the rate expression will pass through maxima and if you differentiate that dv over ds and equate it to zero you will end up in maxima and the maximum reaction velocity will be obtained at substrate concentration which is sm = vkm.	9.541788855572607
Now , that basically says , now what the effect of temperature on rate of polymerization and , and molecular weight for different radical processes means , different radical processes is initiated by different initiation reaction as and also , in case of the radical reaction where you have chain transfer reactions.	10.04518500599313
This is s.	8.124725487082781
So it is approach from this carbon is , preferred , both electronically and satirically.	10.031893773718638
Similarly , you can get the other side of examples.	7.82391967654898
Initially the stability is very high; suddenly there is a bacterial contamination action and the decay becomes very fast or some fault in the operation takes place.	10.995822722033955
So , it could be radical , it could be cation or it could be an anion.	7.754031931117078
Now , we can so if you know these values , when we know that if the two monomers which are having very electrostatic charge , having very positive charges like acrylonitrle and maleic anhydride.	11.050189132723562
This can be written for variety of cases and solved within boundary conditions so as to give you the reactor performance.	9.404052787817063
The net result will be that you are handling something like if you consider that let us say one nano mole of an enzyme substrate concentration of n binding sites per mole will be equal to n pico mole of one binding site molecule.	10.367887402339539
So , you pour that pre - polymer into the sheet and then without starting you do the reaction.	7.215543752593287
And if you want to find out the colligative properties of that sample , then we know that this is m n which we need to know , rather than m w.	9.027201201958855
Now from thermodynamics we can write the mu 1 as mu 1 by mu 1 0 by rt; you know this is 40 i.	10.255652905415408
So , you have to divide by n 2 factorial by the total number of arrangements; these are the total number of distinguishable arrangements.	8.405902341388353
I can write this as another constant oh.	9.297340630890197
Now , this happens to vinyl acetate as well , but look at the comparison between vinyl acetatestyrene , vinyl acetates are the numbers for vinyl acetate are r , so higher.	9.528376504962916
For example form of the enzyme; the nature of the substrate is also fixed.	9.408668626547257
And depending upon this nature of this reacting species r splash , you can classify these chain polymerization reactions in different types; for example if the r star is , reactive species in this case , is a free radical , then we name this reaction or polymerization as a free radical polymerization.	10.721771214600777
For example here you are not putting continuously you are putting only in one shot.	9.538362189160088
Cornish bowden plot gives you a possibility not only to get the range of km and vm values but also makes a check on the validity or accuracy of your experimental data and which is probably one of the very basic features in the case of enzyme kinetics that your experimental data must be pretty accurate to be able to analyze the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reaction.	9.952016861150186
Now , if you have this along with plus if you have say terephthalic acid in the other side.	7.731120770376432
Do we the we described in last lecture that , the elastic that the resistance to deformation , is due to the chain entanglement , because of presence , because of chain entanglement , the chains are presence other , may be intra molecularly , or other chain , the intra molecular chains segments are present in the vicinity of a particular polymer chain , which basically resist the deformation.	11.423829293452576
So therefore this simplistic way as we were also talking yesterday was to linearize the michaelis menten equation and one of the simplest ways to linearize was double reciprocal plot.	9.485881732796162
So , you get a positive value and acrylonitrle is more strong electron withdrawing group.	6.7663148420886525
Multisite enzymes have identical , independent subunits.	15.612012220053058
There is no asymmetry in this.	7.146180912641939
In the case here by the participation of the functional groups or the acids or basis we are weakening the bonds which are involved in catalysis.	9.00686956460045
That means either the pore diameter is large or the particle size is reduced.	8.21071108182243
That means the kind of reactants we have used in immobilization , the kind of matrix we have used in immobilization and whatever the interaction between the matrix and the enzyme under the conditions of immobilization , whatever conformational changes have taken place , whatever kinetic parameters have been modified as a result of this interaction are considered in the inherent parameters and we define them as v = k2e0s / km + s the parameters are just given prime and the inherent parameters have no role to play or not much can be done during the reactor design or reactor operation.	9.289277042190006
So , the slope would give you r 1 and the intercept should give you r .	9.559038748180704
So , objective of flame integration , which to suppress , suppression of smoke , and toxic gas , it is actually is a known fact that , when something burns , it is a , if the causality or fertility of the people is mostly , because of the toxic gases , at first few minutes.	11.110566238563333
So , basically you are plotting a different temperature , the composition of the solution so at any point in this region , you get a single phase which is polymer soluble in the solvent.	8.677221006967944
So , this is again not directly related to chemistry but , you must know the basic nomenclatures and basic techniques , how which how by which the polymer is converted from a resin to a product for final applications.	8.624418209944386
This is the living body and the blood passes through the dialysis membrane , a dialysis device in which the blood is dialyzed against a dialysate , usually a buffer.	10.215759849582351
Whether it is chemical catalysis or enzymatic catalysis the primary function or the primary route by which a catalyst functions is by reduction in this activation energy.	9.945833702654411
So , what is done industrially , you make a rubbery , rubberic code , so you make a rubberic code of poly butadiene.	9.501745862736664
And subsequently , they have lots of others steps which happens following the absorption process.	10.899024912403563
So , we will start from this today and then move on to composition drift in a copolymer as we go on increasing the conversion in the copolymerization reaction.	8.054883292346211
If you make a secondary plot of 1 / km verses i , 1 / km = 1 / km + i / km . ki you will get the value of ki.	9.757599536596237
Now , this butyl rubber has remained flexible at low temperature , like minus 50 degree.	7.891025611548787
This enzyme substrate complex then breaks irreversibly to form the product and enzyme is released back.	9.53704908390321
The three types of living radical polymerization.	7.50048320759626
It is not that every polymer has or every monomer has a single ceiling temperature.	7.80075407056112
We discussed two cases of enzyme deactivations during continuous operation of the reactor one was substrate independent where in the earlier case of aminoacylase substrate concentration plays no role and the deactivation constant is predominant but in the case of the aspartase , it is substrate dependent deactivation and higher the concentration of the substrate the operational life is comparatively better.	10.836148749272565
None of the amino acids are good electron acceptors and many reactions which are primarily based on electron acceptors require additional input in the form of cofactors.	10.895107457645514
Major contaminant in biological samples are nucleic acids which also have absorbance at about 260 nm and therefore sometime how to make an account of protein concentration taking in view the absorbance as a result of nucleic acid and very often the.	11.052835604095478
Now , to do that , let us first look at the principle of the separation in gel permeation chromatography.	10.162051437436997
Now you can always argue , that why not just mix , and blend the homopolymers.	8.693737293855644
Now , if by any means if you can know what is the rate of termination reaction.	8.161802094771387
Almost all the reactions when we want to carry out in organic solvent we also need a very small quantity of water which plays a key role in the catalytic function of the enzyme.	8.671827199714194
Similarly , the t m is little less sharp , compare to a small molecular melting point , because the polymer chain has many molecular weight; basically consist of chains having many molecular weights.	9.899913790705053
That means as i mentioned some time earlier that the thickness of the film can be controlled by either increased linear flow velocity in the case of packed bed reactor or by increasing the agitation speed in the case of cstr.	7.501614563419514
Then there is a possibility that there is h mixing would be negative and that as it approach the solubility parameter approach , does not predict any value any negative value of delta h mixing.	10.05221845812688
This is the rate constant for radical monomer reactions for different monomers and different polymer radical.	7.896484331684543
First , let us talk about different types of initiation reactions , different types of initiation reaction and first one is , which is more common is , by reaction of monomer with an electrophile , say r plus and this electophile could be h plus , which you get it from protonic acids.	9.934334008757983
Basically there this two arrangement of replacing one solvent molecule or interchanging one solvent molecules with another or one solute molecule with another solute molecules will not give you any indistinguishable arrangement.	9.944951753014603
And if they are well separated , obviously , there will not be any possibility of such type of intermediate formation and hence as usual the trans product will be predominant.	7.979937914230699
It is basically the sphere which i showed in last one; the polymer chain plus the solvent molecules which moves along with the polymer coil and you can imagine an equivalent sphere.	11.105940539892966
So , we can monitor the amount of conversion of monomer into polymer with time , so basically we can do a kinetic study of kinetic study of the polymerization process.	9.152165468940595
Now the diffusivity of the gas depends upon chemical structures , so it does not.	9.939097803915459
Briggs and haldane s parameter of rate constant ( k - 1 + k2 / k1 ) was named as michaelis and menten constant which is analogous to dissociation constant.	7.2064066223381555
W is the possible distinguish; all the arrangement you are doing by changing the position of the molecules has to be distinguished and they have to be of the same energy because in this case of ideal solution because interaction energies are same between like and unlike molecules so , once if you do interchange between solute and solvent molecules , they will produce degenerate arrangements.	12.358189820327619
Now , these molecules , in normal case , where supposed to generate 2 radicals , but in this case on reacting with a chain , propagating chain , it is only producing 1 radicals.	10.056048997521785
For example in solution water molecule will be present as the ligand and will complex with water and chloride ions.	9.156463032599422
So , polymers are both ideal elastic and viscous behavior , depending on the time and the temperature , so we call polymers are viscoelastic.	11.124760674527066
If we compare between m a and m m a they are very close.	8.630916822719726
Similarly , phosphorous containing flame retardant act as a flame retardant by forming insulating char , the other flame mechanism by which , fire retardants works is by interfering with the chemical reactions , that maintain the fire and promotes the state of the fire.	10.027476152203942
So , that it will get clear little bit more , if it is not clear already.	9.8976433864242
The only constrain or the assumption here to be considered from the quantitative point of view as the batch reactor or as a perfect mixed batch reactor will be that the cycle time of the substrate must be very , very small compared to the total batch time.	9.899161546107589
So if the thiele modulus is high , the reaction rate is faster.	8.746491103247076
So , if you have polyethylene molecule with 10000 repeating units , each carbon - carbon length is 1.54 armstrong.	8.291746428564963
The next simple form of reactor system which is commonly employed is a continuous stirred tank reactor.	8.558579255022439
The chances of forming cyclics are much more , because cyclics are not reacting with the byproduct and forming the linear product once again , which means once cyclics forms it will remain in the final product.	10.350904904443604
For example 2 2 dash azo bis isobutyronitrile , which is most commonly named as , or called as a i b n , which is having this following structure.	10.895557498538489
Two , they can be tight ion - pair; these are very tight , no solvent molecule in between.	10.546528221953551
Finally , degradation of carrier itself.	11.161875767420032
We have two points.	9.005116036135718
So , we are not considering the rate for chain transfer in polymers case , so if i can write 1 over x bar , i can write r t by b by r p , similarly r transfer mono by r p and so on , other terms.	9.602786329305985
Typical molecular for the commercial polymers are 20000 to 100000 pdi , 3 to 10 and t g of these polymers are about 120 degree of centigrade.	11.340706928239468
If we want to compare the performance of both cstr and pfr as i mentioned in the case of zero order regime there is no change and the performance remains identical.	9.225989540277567
Now let us look at some data.	5.963832123154662
Fourth one again z minus 1; so that is you have to remember , so z minus 1 p.	12.35942373455631
We take an isotropic scatterer and because we know isotropic scatterer the delta r theta is the angle independent.	9.663467305260113
The enzyme is complementary to enzyme substrate complex , the enzyme active site and not to the substrate itself.	9.879786299528982
In many cases we will also notice that the actual inhibitor does not follow a very typical pattern and very often we end up with a profile that intersects neither on the y - axis nor on the x - axis and intersects somewhere in the middle point.	8.901597062831577
Now , if you think about the polymer wrap , a transparent polymer wrap which are used in a grocery stores , which we use for wrapping this fruits or food materials , and they are kept in a refrigerator and a freezer.	9.693670527809951
In fact the fischers lock and key arrangement was not based on any of the analytical probes.	9.528325589879081
The two effects the partitioning effect and the mass transfer of the diffusional effect can be visualized here if you notice here for example in the right hand side diagram we have assumed a hypothetical carrier preparation which is poly anionic in nature.	9.614706193064837
The challenge is to unfold and link these non - natural reactions for the enzyme available in bulk quantities.	10.001498161382044
Now you should look at these molecules , this is not very regular.	14.150282550125775
So , you i hope you understand all this stage i , stage ii , and stage iii , one more time stage i is completed when all this inactive size surfactant micelles gets broken , into for supplying surfactants to the active micelles.	9.306783615354108
So , in that sense , this anionic and cationic polymerization at very and only if the monomer has , monomer with , monomers with , with inductive effect and ability to stabilize the propagating species by resonance in the , both for cationic and anionic , then this monomers can be polymerized by both cationic and anionic.	9.115100231293177
Typical , common reaction is about the 10 to the power of 2 transesterification reaction of the order of 1 to 1.	11.148794194973576
So these are some of the major mechanisms that have been proposed for explaining the specificity of the enzyme action.	9.28540652228591
Now in the case of 1, 2, 3 and 4 addition , this polymer chain also can have three possible tacticities.	10.523216193827027
Enzyme is coupled here.	10.805754456599706
So , incase of poor solvent , a single polymer chain is tried to , because of excluded volume effect tried to expand whereas , polymer solvent interaction , because they are unfavorable to compact.	10.005375712651324
Don t consider this dot.	13.938969119126718
The only enzyme which is known to act on both the stereoisomers or the enzymes whose function is to interconvert l and d isomers are usually called as racemases.	10.388170975382433
The creation of active site on the surface of an enzyme molecule is brought about by tertiary folding of the enzyme protein.	8.773073687051454
That is soluble , fibrous or particulate.	10.55798040456468
Looking at activators from the mechanistic point of view , the role of activators can be considered as binding to the enzyme molecule to give you an activated enzyme.	10.435459348398227
They participate by forming transient covalent bond.	9.67446157638584
Now i continue further simplification you will get.	9.980246725540884
So , how can we achieve that.	7.624180973572046
Now , what about del s.	7.146166823165157
If you look at the industrial applications until sixties there was not a very significant application of enzymes in industrial processing.	8.473515608833683
Now , with this i think we have discussed the ring opening polymerization , now let s talk about few examples of commercial reopening polymerization , this are the typical this are the polymers which are available commercially which are made by ring opening polymerization.	9.028273286967535
This reaction is not available in the human beings but since microbial systems are totally dependent on synthesis of folic acids it can easily inhibit the growth of microorganism and sulfanilamide is a very potent antibacterial agent in the case of human systems.	10.813407728712738
You can add basically the same way; it is basically the same way you have added the second one , you have to add third , fourth , fifth , sixth , etc , the same way you have to arrange.	10.725968180869225
So , that is the time when the quick decision is reached.	7.906157998827969
So , at if you consider these expressions with time goes molecular concentration the monomer drops so as the concentration of the initiator.	8.817427797940828
Now k and a are constant as we just discussed while deriving the expression and t s; that is same that is constant for a given polymer solvent temperature system.	9.236760326125653
So , new researcher a researcher should focus on to make efficient base management of the polymers , which are used for different application.	9.181877256418794
You know they are having a definite order.	7.6742619388061115
Now this cannot be this two configurations cannot be interchanged by simple rotation of around the single bond.	8.082206695546198
Therefore when the substrate and the enzyme active sites are brought in proximity and the binding takes place between the substrate and the enzyme active site it brings in a strain.	8.400148587001027
In the fourth reaction 1 into star is getting consumed , and 1 into star is getting produced , so they also do not change , this reaction also do not change the concentration of m 2 star.	9.382519302686966
In this case , what do you see here.	6.529582830410992
In this case what happened heat is supplied , at a particular rate in the system , and difference in the temperature , between the sample , and the reference is observed.	9.905674083800262
So , they are the value of delta the solubility parameter of polymer are typically determined indirectly and it is basically following the approach , we took delta h becomes 0 as delta 1, delta 2 becomes same.	9.742891734253593
You conduct the enzyme catalyzed reaction in a buffered medium with different ph values and get the reaction rate and use the one which has the maximum value.	10.843980855771605
If it befits the experimental data , if it predicts or gives you a close relationship with experimental data it is acceptable , both the rate equation as well as mechanistic hypothesis we have assumed are acceptable.	11.764676459503614
So , if i want to join them at different temperature , i will get a line for the binodal points.	6.8979972029286
Obviously one tribu butyne has much more stabilization.	11.513430511365627
Big one cannot go inside the pore so , will come out fast and the smaller one can go inside the pores , and which will take more time to come out; obviously , polymers chains are also having a distribution.	10.54076554540456
So , they would be polymeric or polymeric additives as well for example , this ptfe polytetraflurideethylene are added to the polymer to improve the wear resistances or coefficient of friction.	10.102861577615052
Twenty different amino acids that are linked through peptide bonds and the size of the chain may extend some where from 100 amino acids to 300 amino acids in different enzymes.	10.282309002839757
If you carry out the steady state reactor performance as a function of flow rate and determine the overall reaction rate constant based on the reactor performance , then you can determine by intercept 1 /.	8.54462919826473
In certain cases if it is so , the heat transfer characteristics also must be taken into account.	11.497654652355061
So , what is a gel point.	6.732693331328548
I would like to mention here that most continuous enzyme reactors are usually operated little below their optimum temperatures just to increase or reduce the kd values and increase the operational half life.	9.4446786411057
Before i begin , just let us recap the discussion we had on radical chain polymerization in last two lectures , lecture 9 and 1.	10.431781771633286
In this whole process the major problem is that one has to discard the enzyme , one has to deactivate the enzyme and the enzyme is usually not possible to be recovered at the end of the process.	9.221630774010979
So you can just write e.	8.257775858820086
So , this two points should match and this is the intercept k c by delta r theta as c is equal to 0 and theta equals to .	7.716340020682953
One of the major constraints of operational parameters is for many processes the operational parameters required for an enzymatic catalysis should not induce any side reactions.	8.332430508874086
The delta is e value will be higher in the robbery state , correspondence to corresponding to , or compare to a glassy state.	10.802671112773215
There have been efforts in which this has been successfully proven , of course in very specific cases.	9.211394689508976
At the end of this stage i , the surfactant are consumed , so you have fixed number of particles , particles i mean polymer particles plus free monomer surround by the surfactant molecules , so they have now fixed in number.	8.620781416799025
Their effect on the kinetic parameters of the enzyme reaction is just to increase the apparent michaelis menten constant.	9.688399742331672
Trade names width , this is known commonly known in the market and the problem in case of because as i said in earlier classes that in earlier lectures that you , when you use the final a polymer material , you do not use the polymer as such from the synthesis and after it coming out synthesize you add with some other additives and then make compounding and finally , form a product out of that so that the final use of that polymer is not as such 100 percent polymer , there will be some other ingredient has to help and that that plastic or that final use of that polymer , that is no , you said the company so sell this as trade name , where the problem is in trade name that somebody who is know learning polymer chemistry or it is very difficult to remember because same polymer will have different trade names coming from different companies.	11.036610312708937
A will determine the magnitude of the degree of inhibition.	7.8811564074759275
So , that is why you would like to avoid this gel effect and and branching and and so on.	6.6113698002873535
In this case we cannot simply do the polymerization reaction with diamine and diacids you require much reactive component functional group.	8.268453596309678
The antibodies and enzyme molecules in terms of their dissociation constant for their counter part in the case of enzymes it is substrate in case of anti bodies , they are antigens.	14.101889727399291
The other important polymers in this family is poly chloride.	9.044025710795987
The frequency required is very high that means initially he starts a dialysis once in a month and he may end up in daily dialysis.	11.376983834655865
Another way again an empirical way to look at the film diffusion has been proposed by satterfield.	10.804245440376693
So , even if you stopped at the very beginning with a very low conversation at say 5 percent , you see high molecular weight , polymers , monomers and the initiator in the medium.	9.118419630862148
Now , this case p is probability that the propagating radical will continue to propagate and build polymer.	7.278514987077652
So , they can undergo polymerization reaction , say the live you can add a second monomer and form block polymer at the end of the polymerization.	6.56345927278273
Now , let us move just have a deep discussion of the , just now we talked about whatever discussion we have about the dimension is mainly or mostly all about linear polymer , which is shown here this; now you can have branches also , you can have short branches , and you can also have long branches.	10.447171102018741
And at the end we discussed the complete list of conditions or the criteria , which one must be maintaining during the polymerization or at the beginning of the polymerization to have a successful step polymerization.	9.392671399973459
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
If you compare semi crystalline material , semi crystalline polymer at same temperature , and same rate.	8.770170044793607
That means the rate increases initially and reaches to a saturation level.	7.366450975923561
Now , once they start the polymers reaction , the monomer concentration will be lower because monomer is getting converted into polymer.	9.485392219019113
Welcome back to this portion of polymer chemistry and into this 19th lecture , i am going to cover rest of the discussion on anionic chain polymerization , and then i will start our discussion on chain copolymerization.	7.6433378200357875
Now , if we increase , say , around this 25 degree centigrade , say 50 degree or say 100 degree , it will come down little bit , go up little bit even though the numbers will be very low , which means , if you do it at 100 centigrade , you almost quantitatively convert the monomers.	9.658353012419175
The magnitude of kl then gives you at steady state , the reaction rate.	8.07754293539549
So , there is a let me draw that.	6.547837683092318
So , electron density t goes down and electron density goes up and the value is negative e is negative , when the double bond in say this monomer the double bond it is electronic rich compared to a ethylene molecule it is a simple double bond.	10.285647748874906
I was just trying to define the term what i introduced here as epsilon.	11.352378458352293
The involvement of certain amino acids at the active site is a result of the whole folding process in which all amino acids are involved.	9.707047774476449
You also studied the molecular weight distribution and we found that , we found that in , in case of number fraction of the different molecular weight chains , the lower molecular weight chains , the the chains , which are having lower molecular weights , they represent in maximum number.	10.34892278394723
So , if you can from the weight loss , we can get some idea about whether that this type of reaction is happening.	8.241055072812285
What is done is that this thin film of the enzyme containing enzyme is bound spirally on to central core.	10.875498407919762
Now , this knowing , what are polymers , what are plastics and what brings the good properties in polymers.	9.641904062659759
In case of a pure liquid or a pure solvent or pure solution , the molecules are very regular , you know , quite regular , so that , we can use such a 3d lattice.	10.541704554023065
So , because there is a interaction between this counter ion and the chain end and the monomer , they will form a predominantly cis product now , if you increase the polarity of the medium then obviously , then the counter ion and the lithium will be well - separated.	9.133706929071524
We have to find n 0 and n.	7.83989449606429
We assume in most of the analysis that s0 is much , much greater than enzyme concentration.	7.324271739475569
So , what is light scattering.	7.387213627442104
So , the polymer because of the increase in the size , the polymer chain goes , the polymer stiffness goes up and hence the t g goes up.	8.535882600063294
I think one of the very basic issues which come to mind is that why do we study enzymes as a separate class.	10.577665678259875
There will be a fall in the oxygen concentration , dissolved oxygen concentration which will be monitored by the electrode and this fall in dissolved oxygen concentration under steady state will be proportional to the substrate concentration.	9.25351214594441
The carrier loading capacity also depends on the bulk density of the immobilized enzyme preparation and things like that.	8.29678925831439
But the cstr provides an ideal tool and in many cases of immobilized enzyme reactions ph control is a requisite.	10.192910382227304
And there are different models available like regular adjacent folds , irregular adjacent folds and nonadjacent switchbacks.	9.600866505888439
That means a very dilute solution of gluteraldehyde is required and at a ratio of about 1 : 1.	10.072527097027393
World over the production of a glucose fructose syrup is mediated through corn.	13.448677571471633
This term rt / nh x k * is the second order rate constant.	7.545500217693328
Polymerization is slight like vinyl carbozole and in vinyl phirilidin phirilidone.	12.85884440527139
Their order of complexity increases on the basis of the number of parameters considered.	10.962546283330182
The rate of diffusion is fast enough.	9.178409266698983
This is the operational profile.	8.100523315853279
During storage it develops a haze and this haze is as a result of reaction between polyphenolics and polypeptides because both these molecules comes from the basic raw materials.	10.391772047559202
When i talk of ternary complex formation i am referring to a ternary complex formation before the product is formed.	8.12534089131403
You cannot have the reaction progressing further.	9.945405162657261
For example t - butyl phenyl benzoate , it can break from here , and form two different radicals.	9.810028587645988
These ionic polymerizations can be easily employed to tailor - made copolymers , like block copolymers , anionic polymers , which have a very niche applications where you do not need any larger quantity , but in small.	11.03294259144276
In fact even one can have an altered km for an immobilized enzyme as compared to soluble enzyme which again depending upon the same feature as optimum ph that is the matrix is charged and the substrate is also charged where the partitioning effects , the apparent km might also change.	9.562800486708577
Now , once you isolate the pure monomer first block , and then add to the , and then reacted with the styrene molecule we get this block copolymer; obviously , from the ratio.	10.307455125025339
The cost is also of a very high order but the quantity required is of less than micro gram quantities but in a very highly purified state.	9.647940376691814
The net charge in the protein will depend on ionization state at a given ph of all the contributing proteins in the system.	9.697610705112025
So , you do not need any calibration.	4.410630193034952
Now this case arises; the osmotic pressure difference between the two sides and the solvent because of the chemical potential difference.	11.56581034454492
For example consider glucose.	7.965415044661551
Therefore there the shift from the soluble enzyme to immobilized enzyme became a very great incentive to bring down various facets of cost and having a much cleaner process this can give a better quality product , much higher yield , ease of purification and all those advantages.	10.786362629870856
Now , we have seen that the disc scheme what we have been talking till now is valid for radical initiation or ionic initiation , but this values , the set of values for r 1 and r 2, they are almost independent for a radical initiated chain copolymerization , but the values of individual r 1 and r 2 could dramatically change if the mode of initiation is changed.	8.390650003559086
There are certain general patterns which we follow in studying reversible inhibition and before we go to the individual cases i like to highlight that.	9.236716110777095
So , this is like elastomer.	6.711541640092777
That means if you take a differential element of the fluid stream which passes through time dt , whatever the concentration of substrate in that stream which is passing through time dt multiplied by the fraction of the exit stream which is of age between t and dt and t + dt , and sum it over the all the elements.	8.032126131353419
Now , a company which makes polycarbonate , which sells polycarbonate like say bayer or sabic.	10.15153998035117
The rate constant here as you notice is k1, k - 1 and k.	9.179567282834558
So , here we are already showing for three concentration , but in practically there should be more concentration and we are only showing data for three angels.	10.407124700391455
Second parameter , which is responsible for permeability is the solubility , and solubility of a gas in a polymer depend upon , the chemically affinity between gas , and the polymer we are talking about; that depends upon the solubility parameter of the gas , and the polymer metals , we discussed earlier , when we discussed the polymer solutions , we talked about the solubility parameter.	10.866459211565905
So , this , you can also write from our previous knowledge that this is the enthalpy parameter , this is the entropic parameter and theta is kappa t psi.	11.090925765829665
The value of this t g is given by the two expressions i just wrote in it.	10.689946753419706
Relative decrease of productivity , the tau and productivity are related inversely.	13.158347900176354
You see that the energy of activation from here is reduced to this level.	8.103448403552166
The third category of the reversible inhibitor is un - competitive inhibition.	6.7327128569612915
The low temperature was always understood phenomena that at low temperatures the enzymes will have a much better stability.	10.9713060506313
This is just to illustrate the point so that the system does not become complex immediately and we will be able to appreciate.	10.464789329166951
So , you get a gel is very high viscous material , so it is a gel effect this called gel effect , this is gel effect or is called effect , this is steady state.	10.49119422941792
Almost similar functional groups on the ligands are used for making the matrices there.	10.879857435149775
However , there are many disadvantages for this conventional calibration.	10.804435604928951
In this case , we are doing or we are carrying out the reaction in a close system which means none of the reactants or the products are taken out from the system , and reaction is allowed to reach a equilibrium and from this reaction , we now can say that this is the formula which relates an average degree of polymerization with the equilibrium constant.	9.041616292445859
So , from one radical you have be discussing that , we had one kinetic chain , in this case from one radical , we have 1 dead polymer plus 1 another kinetic chain.	10.08442229949853
That means in so much of protein what activity can be carried out.	9.430033053626946
The reaction system will have to face all the problems like concentration polarization of an ultra filtration system and unless those are taken care the reaction performance will be adversely affected.	10.367781504030091
What is , it would look like , for a redox initiator.	12.454650734204721
Let us take one more time.	6.6294888225859
Sk1 does not form e.	12.9791279636005
So to increase t m , you prefer to have a stiffer chain , because if you have stiffer chain , then the entropies increase and melting is less , so t m goes up.	9.11070244439574
So , entropy of the polymerization is combination of propagation initiation , as well as , termination.	9.454421800762907
So , again this is meaning , this means that if you want to build a high molecular weight , always better to take out the condensate out from the system.	6.822848582763588
It arises situation where the rate of initiation is faster compared to rate of propagation and also the reactions which were responsible for terminating a reactive species , reactive chain were absent in this case.	9.791718262676527
If you want to make a transparent polymer , then; obviously , for a given thickness , and for given wavelength , it s always preferable to use a polymer , having lower refractive index , then a polymer with having a higher effective index.	9.827962753673077
I like you to see the sensitivity of the measurement which is probably much higher than any physical or chemical measurement system at this concentration level.	9.442723935900494
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and today we will continue our discussion on radical chain polymerization.	3.4311761641831326
We shall be clear with few example , let us talk about two molecules decane and substitute methyl substitute decane like 2 4 6 8 10 pentamethyldodecane.	10.29944659221882
Now basically what happened , this is not a ideal viscoelastic material to demonstrate , but i can show it , so that you can understand what do i mean by viscocity.	12.03875457961849
The elastic properties of linear thermo plastic polymers , are due to chain entangle.	11.733614358011152
And when the load is removed at t is equal to t , it will recover some part , and then stay somewhere , so it does not come back to the original so on.	9.07781213804079
This cupric ions after reduction forms a co - ordination complex with the nh group present in the peptide bond.	9.928587067292632
So , by this way , if you have all the chains are capped with a long functional entity , not reactive group , then will these molecules will not take part in further reactions.	8.880578017328872
Now you also know , second , this is , this shows that the critical composition at which the polymer becomes one phase system to the two phase system is highly dependent on the molecular weight because this is also proportional to molecular weight.	10.192693170443654
Now , how to get these delta value , the value of the solubility parameter.	8.556097135886485
We have so far seen that the performance of idealized continuous flow immobilized enzyme reactors depends primarily on the reaction kinetics and the basic assumption for idealized reactors was that the immobilized enzyme preparation does not experience any mass transfer or partitioning effects.	9.998723774050239
Now , in this case , if you can if you want to make a foamed polymer , you can add some inner gases here.	7.508684041290344
Now , to have r is close to 1, you first have to know the purity of the monomer and if there is an impurity , you do not know what you are putting in the reaction.	8.387513127809687
Now , why why people use polymer compared to this conventional materials or traditional materials.	9.523727186733634
Flexible backbone , obviously t g goes down , if you have the steric hindrance , because of presence of bulky side groups or side bulky pendant groups , then the rotation around single bond becomes difficult , as a result stiffness goes up and t g goes up.	10.28506774744028
When you call long chain , long or short how it distinguish between whether the branch is long or short , if the branch , length of the branch is more than the entanglement chain length of the entangled molecular weight for entanglement chain length they , what is the entanglement chain length is the length between two entangled portions.	10.819238511562634
So , monomers with polar groups in the substituent will help in coordinating with the counter ion and the monomer; the incoming monomer.	8.016335858425357
So , this is a block of tertiary , butyl , acolyte there should be two ends here to represent this is unit , now from this what we can do , we can get the molecular weight of the first block , and then when we react with a another monomer this case styrene , then we can make a block copolymer , this is also present in this side.	8.72146253224103
Then there will be blocky nature , in the copolymer resulting copolymers , if there is no reactivity difference then there is no.	12.550675711337753
What will be the relation between the degrees or average degrees of polymerization with nu.	10.048036745080525
The principle interactions that are present in the case of any given protein or that applies to an enzyme are peptide bonds.	10.575119483507649
Such a synthetic reaction route although takes place in microbial systems does not take place in the human beings.	9.180042615001248
Now , utilizing this concept you can actually synthesize functionalized polymers , which are also called telechelic polymers , which we discussed in the last class.	9.048252301771491
They form complexes with enzyme molecule , enzyme substrate molecule , both or one of them.	9.367394842792681
For example , whatever we commonly talked about , say polyethenes , these bags , pouches , food wraps or cloth wraps and all these things , they are made up of polyethylene.	9.210666779739094
Then these fibers can be used in a variety of modes in a reactor.	9.967221517517439
So , the free volume because of this long chain is much more compared to the free volume produced by bulky groups having a spherical type shape or coil type shape.	9.929632515672072
This comes from petroleum products , which is eventually coming from crude oil.	13.37370757075389
So , that is the fundamental one fundamental difference between chain polymers and step polymers , how do we calculate or how do you understand , what the average degrees of polymerization is or the average molecular weight average number average molecular weight is.	9.114119278853629
But that vm value is at a particular enzyme concentration.	8.335773220796616
So , if this is higher means the m 1 will have a longer sequence in the copolymer , and m 2 you have a shorter sequence in the co monomer.	9.217590130919225
So , it will react with b , other side will be a , again this will react with b , so other side will be a.	6.8580438272857345
To have a high molecular weight polymer you need to have high value of x n , is the number one monomer unit or structure unit present in the system.	8.248359234629755
But just to consider two simple model cases let us consider a substrate which in its unionized form is not catalytically active but is able to bind to the enzyme for catalytic function.	9.351012752892736
Now , this both cases the polymer radical is the same so this will get cancelled.	9.62640670350029
It basically , let me show here strain.	9.881203943076496
You are familiar with number of biomolecules like carbohydrates , lipids , proteins.	9.190371300968648
Now , you can even functionalize this by such reagent and here you can make a polymer with a functional group at the end , so it can be utilized.	9.82010304188064
Obviously , this is the negative term and there is a negative sign here , so this is a positive term.	10.327078066225427
Now , what we are going to do , we are going to plot this binodal and spinodal points with respect to temperature.	8.095404871797154
So therefore at any constant value of b you can consider that the apparent value of km for a ka is k a . kb + ka . b kaapp = kb + b this is the apparent km with respect to a by rearranging this general equation.	9.548960854617778
So , you must make some polymer , some molecular weight we should be able to pass through the processing step , so that you can get the final product.	8.214405081083818
Is that right.	13.350829867081602
Basically , with increase the soft disperse phase , the modulus increases.	10.374036870846117
So , theta solvent again , so theta solvent and if your amorphous polymer , the dimension of a real polymer chain is same as the dimension of unperturbed chain.	9.246660684291573
If you assume that then the boundary conditions will change.	7.251064580280231
So , these calibration curve between log m log of molecular weight and this elution volume is applicable only for a particular polymer whose k and a are constant.	8.595969510217563
So , again on average , we have 2 chains or 2 moles of chains with nu degrees of polymerization , 2 into 2 nu divided total number of chains is .	9.838809914522304
So , that is the advantage of a polymer.	4.996250366614551
Now , each a group will react with one b group.	7.903162736684551
So , impact testing is a dynamical load of short duration and very high strain and at high very high strain rate.	9.567013641402218
Now of course , sometimes is very difficult to remove the solvent quantitatively from the polymer no matter how much vacuum you applied it is very difficult some times because solvents stick to the polymer.	9.639112473129485
And , in this lecture , we will discuss about polymer additives.	6.866290383726384
I am just moving it fast , because this just information i my aim is to just give you the generic synthetic procedure for this class of step polymers.	9.729163880686315
So , lewis acidity of these defined metals increases with atomic number.	8.480857646675316
So , now , r will prefer to be at down and hydrogen will prefer avoid the steric hindrance.	7.566265826081864
Now , in this case you make a copolymer , which have this poly ethylene terephthalic unit and also have a polybutylene terephthalate unit.	8.405776408131896
You actually , gel effect is a beneficial for this thing.	10.87369299862669
For examples i talked about the ethylene molecule in or say simple example of say polystyrene molecule.	10.509565527813203
How did you define the degree of polymerization is the number of structure unit.	9.371686662130951
So , when you have copolymer from the ratio of the three , these three peaks , the amount of this type of carbonate present in the system , so if you these are the example for this copolymer made from this two processes.	9.451209999203735
So , this is what is observed experimentally in this axis.	6.897616431709855
And this waved lines means that it is applicable for any size; no , we are talking about general reaction , it could be a end of the dimmer or in dimmer and so on.	8.996895962538167
So , what happen now , now this will continue the reaction till you have the monomer present in this reaction , so the monomer concentration inside this polymerization reactor comes down.	9.48383671923962
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
If they is a endothermic process goes on , in the sample , then you have to supply energy from outside.	11.071511361759768
You know we not want somebody working in the lab with the huge amount of organic solvent that is health hazardous well as the environmental hazardous.	10.515386500848452
Then the reflectivity compare to this , for a material would be given by , will give the value of gloss.	10.617797768972899
And of course , the similar type of advantages are there as in the case of suspension polymers , the heat removal is not a problem , viscosity build up is also not a problem in this case.	9.304088514184878
Just like peptide bond , the nitrogen content is also intrinsic component of any protein.	9.274364296813138
If you take care of the reaction medium very well so that there is no impurities in these polymers that are leaving.	10.769254818985234
And , you must know the interaction of the additives with the plastics; what is the , how they interact with plastics , interacts with other additives; as i said , the multiple additives are used; same times interaction with other additives are also be important.	9.931456315259812
So , intrinsic viscosity of this will be higher than the intrinsic viscosity of the branched polymer chain have the same molecular and if you divide branch by the linear , the value of the branch intrinsic viscosity of linear one you can get the extent of branching in this polymer coil.	9.834113474337379
That is what is the ultimate limit and the internal pore diffusion effects are described by effectiveness factor.	8.552972290787935
In that case you get solvent separated anions , initiator molecules.	6.752995326826402
Now , how do you get or create a condition where this thing , this coordination , strong coordination between the active chain end , the monomer and counter ion happen.	7.564082972187412
So , what happen your rate of polymerization it become slower , so this is retardation and the molecule called retardence.	9.539982592104828
I have told you two kinds of effect of diffusion.	8.784300610783037
Most of the entrapment methods very commonly have been used to entrap the microbial cells and as you will notice that entrapment within calcium alginate beads , polyacrylamide gel and cellulose acetate fibers have been commonly used methods for immobilizing.	9.710547637296582
Enzyme k2 change is solely attributed to conformational changes.	10.172697851660805
As i was talking about the synthesis of the macromolecule the basic backbone of the protein chain in the case of a protein lies in the condensation of two different amino acids.	9.284346959791593
The peculiar feature of this is that the cyclic molecules make a cavity of definite size in which you can retain the definite molecules and this cyclodextrins are being used to attach by covalent coupling some of the chemical groups which can catalyse the reaction.	11.228165147814218
So while we say that these are amino acids that are present on the active site and they participate in the catalysis does not mean that the other amino acids which are playing a role in the folding process have no relevance.	10.047875152156847
Even if you use in a batch mode by physically filtering off the enzyme preparation , the reaction is stopped.	10.46533252601589
In propagating chain , which are expressed as , m n dot , can also react with these , a radical primary radical , and form a dead molecule.	10.4074084225584
The fraction of this , the total enzyme concentration will be proportional to sum of the product of the kappa factors.	10.120746893563178
Directly a polymerization doesn t take place as it is.	10.94351623642799
As the polymer chemistry may not be very much interested in this that the morphology of the crystalline polymers , but we to understand the polymer properties and the structure properties relation , we must know the crystalline behaviour and different types of models in polymer material.	10.197703824957475
The last two steps are irreversible in nature.	8.13663211545709
Unless you subject it to chemical treatments you cannot really remove it by conventional drying methods the bound water present in the enzyme molecule.	10.065957833833599
So , if you take polymer and dissolve in the soluble at in the solvent it will be soluble for that particular temperature in this case t 5 for any at any composition , it will not face separate to any two composition i mean polymer rich and solvent rich , phases as that is thermodynamically not feasible.	10.12159220052708
That means , low number of consol group , it has intermediate conversion.	9.261761594271002
We have discussed earlier , that the solvent plays a very important role in , in terms of rate of polymerization of this ionic polymerization , especially in case of anionic polymerization.	7.725505374292217
I must give you an example of glucose isomerase.	10.527879964933414
We are writing this as a vacant d - orbital.	6.754059093519774
So , that is a head and head to head polymers.	5.644855143637066
Here we are talking about homoliticalic leaving one bond , and making two radical.	10.25738025212894
So in fact even the conformational aspects are important for the applications.	8.57731988393122
So having the relative concentration of each of the enzyme species then you can always write the rate expression that is your v as equal to v = k4.e b = k2.ea it can be either k4.e b or it can be k2.ea.	10.945710737622282
So , what , what is to do.	7.914413589853023
The slope increases but the magnitude of 1 / vm remains unaltered.	11.800345020890012
Then in the case of cstr even colloidal or insoluble substrates can be processed which is not feasible in the case of plug flow behavior and then easy replacement of catalyst.	9.096837249624835
When we look at bisubstrate reactions we notice that this inhibition pattern gives you lot of information about the sequence of binding of the substrate in the case of a bisubstrate reaction.	8.403663522011243
So , r ts plus r transfer monomer plus r transfer solvent and so on.	6.808218135462347
In that sense , from the trade names by which polystyrene is sold is mentioned here styrofoam , cellofoam , dytene and so on.	8.494250105109344
These two binding brings the catalytic sites in close vicinity of the amino group which is available for reaction and the catalytic reaction can take place.	9.473158837439037
There are few advantages like this is a simple setup , only one detector is required whether it is a refractive index detector or only one concentration detector and we can do this calibration without knowing exact concentration; concentration can be variable little bit without no problem and this calibration is very precise and repeatable.	11.216226766982308
So in those cases the analytical procedures can be automated by combining the immobilized enzymes , instead of soluble enzyme , with a standard analytical device.	10.342331094532007
So , it happens , so the higher spectra , higher absorption happen only for the vibrations or bending vibrations for polar bonds.	8.391456265153824
So , i can write log eta m is log k plus 1 plus a log m.	6.608121574989434
So , you are considering one volume , you need volume at a distance r and you are finding out what is the probability of that volume have the other end.	8.517609220041212
And you can rotate the , you are looking from front side , so this is 1, this is 2, this circle is 3, and this is 4 these are the four carbon atoms , so you are looking from front side if you rotate the c 2, c 3 single bond then you will get all this from other conformation.	10.3555102941213
K2 / km considered as a specificity constant will determine the relative specificity of an enzyme to different substrate.	11.169463186935655
The higher is the crystallinity , normally the resistance to the chemical is higher.	8.613149359053898
Now , rate of this polyesterification reaction is again , it become independent on the value of x as well as the n.	9.833515558865264
So , number of bb group will react , will be same as number of a group.	7.7914878037670885
Now , as long , as long as m is less than 1, molar cyclization will be preferred.	8.908027548508084
As soon as the binary complex forms a product is released and the modified enzyme then interacts with the second substrate and the second product is formed.	8.75784264874119
Now flory - huggins equation we can write mu i by mu 0 as earlier case we have seen from the osmotic pressure experiment we can simply write this.	9.37248862806796
The reaction product ends up in hydrogen ions; there will be a ph change and that ph change enhances the enzyme activity.	9.205030360884631
So that is what happens in such cases and a large number of transferases , most of the bulk of tranferases fall in the category of ping pong reaction mechanism excepting those of the yeast source and most of the mammalian hexokinases form under the category of ping pong.	9.746445351676048
In this case , if you can recollect that polymer molecules , because their size was quite different from the solvent molecules , each polymer molecules were divided into x segments , where each segment was having same size with the size of a solvent.	8.772323323911415
It could be a spectrophotometer , it could be a fluorospectrophotometer , it could be as simple as ph meter.	8.103263627628866
Based on the binding pattern , we develop a rate expression compare it to the michaelis menten equation and see how the km and vm of the native enzyme are influenced by the presence of inhibitors.	10.604856941402186
Mind it the reaction binding of b from e is not possible in the ordered mechanism.	10.670228660181518
He also studied the same enzyme and probably concluded in a very broad fashion that the enzyme reaction rates are influenced by acidity and enzyme concentration.	10.797420442449493
You know , growing chain , cannot react with this only react with the monomer.	9.164257193333858
There have been certain exceptions.	9.871368831101124
So , in x minus 1 x mar , a probability of x minus 1 a group reacted is p to the power x minus .	7.239180274217718
Now , once the h o thermic reaction happen , if we do not have arrangements to take out that heat which his evolve chain the reaction , then there will be change in temperature.	9.238040455123532
So , again to form , again write the; now if you go back to this expression , besides this term , this is called as concentration term monomers; and , the concentration of monomer and concentration of initiator , these are also determine your rate of polymerization.	10.129311284422165
For example , again take the example , we can take the example of benzyl peroxide; it get dissociated to case; now , 2 of these can react and form c o 2; this can react with monomer , and there are several side reaction possible with these; and , by this sort of side reaction; these all can undergo phi dot plus c o .	10.35141075557996
In the case of cstr kd . t = ln s0x0 + km ( x0 / 1 - x0 ) / s0xt + km ( xt / 1 - xt ) here the x0 and xt are the fractional conversion in the case of cstr with a time zero and t.	8.938549437408943
So almost similar chemistry is applied excepting that in those cases ligand is a thermally stable molecule.	10.738542450917423
The kind of kinetics the reaction follows dictates very often the choice of reactor types , the design parameters for the reactor and they all involve enzyme kinetics and that becomes quite important tool for reactor design.	10.819068229274787
There will be some enzyme which will be deactivated or lost during the immobilization and the loss of enzyme activity has to be kept minimum for all practical purposes.	8.552617842166072
That means the system behaves almost like diffusional limited even at high substrate concentration which it should not.	8.912575775912723
Therefore they thought that coupling of an enzyme to an insoluble matrix would be a desirable feature to study enzymes or immobilized enzymes as a model system for natural enzymes and then one can really look into the various properties in terms of their operational properties , in terms of their kinetic properties and also in terms of their substrate specificity and other aspects.	10.492980109623371
Kf . kf is known to you depending on the kinetic parameters of the immobilized enzyme.	9.844953454629458
How does it look.	9.076900193628045
So , what is the effect of formation of cyclics in the molecular weight or the degree of polymerization of the final polymers , which can be arrived from carother s equation and without going into derivation we can write , that x n is 1 by 1 minus p , where x is a constant , depends on concentration of the reactants and a is rate of linear polymerization by rate of cyclization.	8.86444206697561
So , number of initiator residues per chain , per polymer chain is 6 by 4 is 1..	8.81010474880912
In the lab the testing which is done is , call limiting oxygen index , it is most versatile small scale test.	11.43045458552943
You can only know the concentration of each other , the moles of each of the monomers and the functional groups if they are pure enough.	11.577528147986289
The catalyst might be able to perform the catalytic function by any other mechanism : by acid base catalysis or covalent catalysis which we will discuss later but the contribution made by stabilizing the transition state of the substrate will not be possible to be provided by the chemical catalyst which enzyme is able to provide and there by it increases the stability of eab * and thereby reduces the energy of activation and leads to the formation of the product.	10.737226370415664
This two are heated , and the temperatures are maintained same.	12.011335608170999
And for the same reason , the purity of , purity of monomers are very important.	8.905762941593041
As a matter of fact i think one can take a clue again here from a living cell.	7.503511953539754
So making a material balance across the reactor you cannot choose any concentration term because the concentration term for substrate changes with the length of the reactor and the concentration of the substrate or product is not constant throughout the reactor.	9.06338068240651
And those are the same types of initiators will be used to basically polymerize the cyclic rings and make a ring opening polymerization.	9.154347937018407
Now , once this is formed which is electron deficient , what happened.	6.139176086875795
When the ph is increased to a level where both the negative ions are ionized and the amino group is not ionized and ultimately you will also meet here a situation where you have zwitterions where one amino group and one carboxylic group are ionized , the other carboxylic group is non - ionized and that is a status.	11.060061293832662
So we will stop at this point today.	5.398159318801904
Now , other types of initiators we talked about the catalyst and co catalyst like b f 3 and h 2 o catalyst and other types can be also used in this cationic ring opening polymerization also.	10.155743020239752
So if these are the t half numbers , for commonly used initiator a i b n and b p o.	9.930238154091919
Because of the high of in the molecular when it build up , there are high molecular weight.	9.082643769763981
So , if one requires to terminate the chain , you can add externally this h 2 o or alcohol to terminate the chain.	8.466922314341398
So , at any moment of time , the concentration of this is very small which means the termination reaction is very less because this is a part of the equilibrium.	9.800907832201261
Although by various other manipulations like adsorption , coupling with cross linking the operational stability can be improved but intrinsically adsorption based methods are usually operationally high.	10.749101764493743
So , if i want to plot; say f 1 versus f 1; that is the , 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1, this is correspondence to the 20 percent composition of monomer aim in the , free monomer in the reactions mixture.	8.904427810792942
We will discuss we will basically continue our discussion having polymers in solution and the topics , we plan to cover today this lecture is now cohesive energy density and solubility parameter.	8.725086699862027
These are the modern detectors available in the market.	6.81492697489116
So , on effect , this two are rarifying each other , and so , final collision frequencies between the functional groups present in a smaller chain compared to a larger chain are equal; and , as the collision frequency , the final functional groups are equal , the reactivity or the rate of reactions also equal.	10.510495676084192
So , we from that , we can know or experiment the determine b and if we know b , we can find out a or number of fractional chain , which are undergoing termination by coupling.	10.180674305834463
Now , let us begin with , let us see what is a process.	7.664586159942374
In fact a large number of hydrolytic enzymes follow such a behavior including proteases , particularly.	9.650925122932511
This is applicable to again to low molecular weights because when the polymer chains becomes very high , the number of end groups the contribution from number of end groups becomes very small.	8.614012642515236
Now , what is the typical values of this what are the typical values for radical polymerization r i is twice f k d i k d is 10 to the power minus 6 10 to the power 4 second typically used.	7.544361113567391
That is one minimum requirement for explaining the specificity of enzyme action that there must be minimum three sites which interact between the enzyme and substrate.	8.979398063702563
Now at the time , when this stress is released it will come back to the original state , and this stress and strain is related by hooks law , they are linear and is related by elastic modulus in between , as a proportionality constant.	9.654380249993382
The simplest and the primary structure is the sequence and the content of different amino acids present in an enzyme sample.	9.40294126071631
Now as i said that before that this box will for polymers of or for a non - polar solvent the non - polar amorphous polymer.	8.46015783227232
So , basically the type of cocatalyst also influence the polymerization because the acidity of this , this complex , the activity of this complex depends on how readily it can supply this cationic species , where i say proton or in this case it is a proton or a carbocation to the monomer , and for a proton or protogen or a proton supplier , it depends on the acidity of the cocatalyst.	9.925744319400962
So , that is your theta 1, this is theta 2 and this is theta .	9.953087749579733
So , the absolute value in this graph will change , if we consider now a cyclic ring hetero atom or the teams remains more or less same.	8.562802433268386
If you look at a very general system where i am assuming that all the r s that are mentioned here are non - ionisable.	9.344449558380292
So , by these are , these are the few ways , where the radicals which got generated by the initiator molecules , they get destroyed and form non reactive molecules.	9.80642344691755
And they are dead basically they are weekly donating all the withdrawing groups so values are very low either positive or negative depending up on what is the electron with drawing effect or electron donating effect.	11.089387214700425
A very large number of studies have been carried out on immobilization of glucoamylase.	10.22965934868512
Why ? it should decrease.	12.27103715146194
So , this is example of that photo stabilizer in normal ground state; and , with absorption of uv light they go to a first exited state , where a proton transfer happen; and , finally , a radiation less process bring them back to a new ground state.	8.452986594731584
Now , often this product of emulsion polymerization are termed as latex , and this latex can be directly used in several applications like paint , coatings and many other applications where you can directly take the you can directly take the polymer product at the end of the emulsion , and apply is as a as a painting or coatings.	10.066750634206757
This sel is element concentration of substrate remaining in the element which is of age t +.	10.159379495926656
The top profile , the first profile indicates a very low value of s0 / km which means a first order regime.	10.191844349761789
So , let us write this.	5.2437352967651565
In today's lecture we will just cover this treat of care we will talk about q e scheme and then briefly about ionic copolymerization how that is different from radical copolymerization.	9.919999659980805
So , you can remain maintain all the advantages of the high polymer bulk polymerization and you can get the polymers by filtration as a beads.	8.764459783098646
Therefore in such cases enzymes provide a kind of organic or highly micro environment within the aqueous bulk environment.	10.645204668852493
On the other hand if the immobilization method is not able to produce or you are not able to get a good method which can recover a good yield of enzyme or the final activity in high amounts in that case also immobilized cells may be an easy or a suitable answer.	8.665236212053438
Now , there are plenty of example of such surface active additives , what i am going to do in this next few minutes is , give examples of or give generic examples of this additives , how they work and give few examples of such additives.	9.059785532065343
So , which means , if the kinetic chain length; there are kinetic chain length which basically , a number of radicals , number of monomers which consumed per radicals.	10.026849165721046
So , you have a reversible , addition reversible fragmentation and this is a transfer reaction because the original radical is getting transferred and getting terminated in forming in a new radical which is a transferred reaction.	10.236872169572562
The substrate concentration profile in such a thick membrane needs to be evaluated based on the second order differential equation.	9.565786334073284
Very commonly encountered proteins are glycoproteins , many of the enzymes , particularly those which are isolated from eukaryotes , a glycoproteins which means that in addition to the amino acids the protein molecule is associated with an oligosaccharide , monosaccharide or an oligosaccharide , they could lipo proteins a lipid molecule , they could be nucleoproteins and a large number of proteins which are metalloproteins containing metal enzymes where the metal ions acts as a cofactor are known.	9.93244153859109
Okay . then we can write probably this is 1 - f2 the total of the active volume and this becomes f2.v.	13.211417819882014
It can also get transferred to a monomer; a monomer forming or forming this combination.	9.915228142802558
Today it has become impossible probably for a bio technologist to leave aside an enzyme molecule , understanding of enzyme molecule in detail before he can call himself to be a professional in the area.	11.28129242934319
So the typical range of bond energy , which are used for a initiator , to be applicable has a thermal initiator is , around 100 to 170 kilo joule per mol.	8.587326177151628
So , it contribute negatively it favors the mixing process , so in theta conditions still the mixing is possible favorable and you get a soluble mixture of polymer and solvent.	9.396489632914447
As i said that you have to keep your reaction temperature above of melting temperature in this case , so that the polymers have mobility , so that they can undergo further propagation reaction.	9.337617255081362
That is e + s e - s he also proposed that this interaction is reversible in nature and he was the first person to propose a mechanistic hypothesis which is followed by enzyme catalyzed reactions.	8.970153337335926
Then enzyme leakage which depends on the method of immobilization you are following.	8.97932541895731
If the reaction is very strongly inhibited by products or strongly inhibited by substrates the profile might undergo a change.	8.502364202521207
Now , let us move to the other properties of polymeric materials , what we discuss , we just completed discussion of mechanical properties.	8.201878855592009
The significance of michaelis menten equation is that it assumes one substrate binding site per enzyme molecule.	7.864297787597323
How the weight fraction of this individual chain varies with x , which is the number of monomer present.	9.658779211246427
This is what happened for acetone and acetonitrile is a theta solvent for the temperature where this temperature for pmma which means the pi by c will be independent of the concentration of the solution.	9.257377468088267
At the electrode is measured dissolved oxygen but the consumption of dissolved oxygen in the fluid is a result of enzymatic reaction.	9.268384619537311
Now , we are not going to details about the living cationic polymerization in this course , but there are , though it is very difficult in case of cationic polymerization , in , in a very careful manner if you can do reactions where you reduce or minimize the chain transfer reaction and the side reactions , then there is a possibility , that you can get a living chain polymerization.	8.888081191713248
So if i have a simple monomer like this , if i can have y as c o r , then we know its can be polymerized by , both radical and anionic , it cannot be polymerized by cationic.	9.110868484498793
So we have now know , that what are the molecules are typically used for thermal initiation , and what are the criteria in that initiator molecule should be , and looking at the t half values at different temperature , we should choose a temperature , and a initiator combination , for a particular reaction if you want to do a reaction for a particular temperature , then if you choose a initiator molecule accordingly.	10.922184456483576
That effect of temperature is much more significant.	13.205908248218606
You can never approach it practically.	10.143949117871905
So these are the two non - ideal flow patterns and these are the two for plug flow as well for well mixed conditions the exit age distribution in terms of f curve.	9.414066863510733
What is the biological view there.	8.98987329636247
Remember , we have only calculated this entropy and the number of ways you can arrange the polymer in the three lattice.	9.145167553522917
While alanine racemase can act on either side of the reaction , it is a reversible reaction and therefore it can act on both l - alanine as well d - alanine.	10.960806208044293
No other excess sugar is acted upon by such an enzyme.	9.177901555895279
There will be a definite strength , this strain and stress are related by hooks law , will come back to that.	7.99076822182299
And if your angle of incident is higher , the reflectivity is higher , and this reflectivity is given by this expression , where alpha is your angle of incident , and beta is your angle of refraction.	10.195664453047712
So , i can write this is the reaction of isobutylene catalysed by this reaction.	7.055073370741849
In both the cases the equilibrium constant of the reaction is approximately equal to one.	6.779123331030408
V0 = vm . s / km ( 1 + k / h + ) s we have seen so for that this ph effects are quite complex and all the parameter that are influenced by ph cannot be considered in one go.	8.806764585536296
So , n 0 minus i x is the number of vacant cell where in the next one , i plus 1 polymer chain we can place.	7.59933537656092
Now , in a normal case , in general case , the formation of this active species , they are much lower compared to this step which basically is the propagation step of the polymers by which the chain is formed which means as soon this active species initiates , this is formed , it initiates and the chain formation is completed.	11.299603404493837
Carrier properties , depending on the property like surface property of the carrier particles which were used as matrix , will also play a role on the adsorption behaviour depending on the nature may be sometime even the carriers are pre - conditioned , swollen to improve the property.	11.261439985131302
So as long as styrene is present , vinyl acetate will only form copolymer , and after styrene is over , consume from the reaction medium , then only it actually form homopolymerization.	10.120881795591396
So that is one limitation that while most of the reactions can be catalyzed by the amino acids present on the active site , certain reactions which are not possible to be catalyzed by this can be carried out by cofactors and that provides a key role for catalytic function.	8.895876842257739
Whereas m 1 star can react with m 1 star in some extent , so what will happen , you will get a something like this.	8.631679550481097
Now , in the beginning we said that we can also use the light scattering technique as dynamic light scattering which is also known as quasi elastic light scattering or sometime photo correlation spectroscopy.	9.52454795357053
We are considering that only a can bind to free enzyme and then this goes to ey with the release of the product x and this goes to e with the release of the product y.	9.72935024248674
So , we have , we will discuss specifically for the requirement of solvent.	8.189263940834936
We will take from this , from this and continue in the next lecture , the quantification.	9.483451054076458
There will be another pore on this side of the same dimension so whatever dimension of the particle we are considering let us say if it is a pallet of thickness twelve we consider l as the thickness because the substrate will be accessible on both the sides.	9.760929677184105
Now , to have a steady flow , you might have a pulse dampener which gives the flow at a steady flow rate and you can have a filter which will filter the solvent.	8.839562293140755
And then , we start today with more options of redox initiator.	7.315712201345131
You put o rings so that the dialysis bed which contains the enzyme is in proximity of the enzyme and it can be used for measurement systems.	11.495180007941906
Now , how can cyclization product if you consider molecules , they are both functional in both the sides.	8.737246277782608
So , if the polarisability is less , the refractive index will be also lower.	8.343738977343316
So , your reaction stops there.	7.707100866913942
But very often for practical purposes we try to look at our reaction conditions and consider if they are closer to zero order or first order depending upon the percentage error that is involved in calculating the space time under the given set of conditions which are the inlet substrate concentration and outlet substrate concentration in the reactor and with in that regime that means fractional conversion and initial substrate concentration in that regimes if the reaction is more close to zero order we very conveniently consider our system as zero order and make the design calculations or in case if it is more closer the percentage error is less in the case of first order kinetics we go for a first order design calculations.	11.012777757919679
Now , it is similar to cationic , but there are some significant differences as well.	7.522127924643852
So , anionic , in anionic chain polymerization you actually consider , that this polymerization happen without any practical termination steps.	10.382420169757827
L is less than one or smaller value then the magnitude of f is approximately one; no diffusional limitations.	8.579237985559297
So , instead of p equilibrium , in last case we are writing p as the conversion.	8.062603703814275
In the case of cstr , you have the reactor performance as k m ( x / 1 - x ) = k 2e.	7.444119475878713
What we happened in typically , how do you write polymer.	9.175000331481305
One and probably in its simplest form is on the basis of sequential interaction model.	10.164660267278181
As i mentioned that the first step in any reaction mechanism would be to express a mechanism in cyclic form so that each of the enzyme species that are present , here as you see there are three enzyme species , e , es and et they must form the vertices of the polygon that represents the reaction mechanism.	8.48711819355247
When we say enzyme substrate complex is formed we are talking of only one enzyme substrate complex that is formed.	9.662818398185578
During this interaction of the enzyme active site with the substrate , the strain produced onto the reactive group as a result of binding process is responsible for specificity as well as part catalytic function.	11.058175972502413
That means the quantity of ligand adsorbed per unit weight of the carrier for low molecular weight ligands will be less as you increase the temperature and the reason attributed to this is because of the movement of the particles as the temperature increases.	9.56345485157393
And as this emphasizes the fact that the final crystallinity in the polymer with extend and the nature will depend upon several processes.	10.647749154807856
Let us talk about , next , light stabilizer.	7.969180673952466
This is individual colors; individual chains represent a individual molecules in this case as well.	8.489126204649299
So , you have a higher rate of reaction or an eventually higher molecular build up.	7.443728236310485
Just to summarize what we have covered so far in the kinetics we have initially looked at single substrate single intermediate reactions leading to hyperbolic kinetics and the validity of this kinetic pattern to a whole range of reactions under different conditions.	9.893322413617845
Out of fire retardants work and they basically , prevent this ignition or combustion process , by whatever means or some means.	10.313192681279068
So , the conversion of polymer , conversion of monomers will be very high , even at the beginning forming dimer , tetramer or these small oligomers.	9.798507752232307
When you do the kappm , partitioning is fixed , the value of f can be noticed and f can give you a value of.	9.819139746222598
Let us take example of cumyl peroxide , it can dissociate into two such radicals.	8.284329208942971
Then what are the possibilities it could happen if it does not build molecular weight; that means , and you know that from the monomer structure that it is it is polymerizable by say radical polymerization root.	12.463371340701926
Hydrophobic monomer , in this case is sebacoyl chloride.	12.85085935059783
But in the case of a reaction that undergoes product inhibition the performance still becomes more superior.	8.621904425379668
If this reacts with other side , then it forms , as species like this.	8.418438317073363
Second method is based on precipitation.	12.844931218869423
And you know by then this car others equation and you also should appreciate that the fact to make high polymer high molecular weight polymer you should have p value close to one.	9.028545049969942
So , they come out fast and the polymers which have lower size they can go inside the pores which makes their path length which are longer compared to a higher sized polymer molecules; and as a results they elute or come out column at a later time.	9.544816866602348
Depending upon the target application , you choose the type of impact test should be done on that sample.	10.4202216022383
Or in another words n will be equal to n = log81 / log s0.9 / s0.1 therefore n is the number of binding sites.	7.422617776652715
We have been able to isolate and characterize only about three thousand.	9.338213504647168
Therefore the yield will be the activity which is recovered in the immobilized form divided by e0 - ei in the residue.	9.963885965488368
The important parameters for the enzyme reactions in organic solvents are the source and presentation of the enzyme.	9.81658336604185
Now , this is this is a very two very strong electron withdrawing group , so basically the electrostatic charge will be much more positive compared to a ethylene group.	8.580577070404107
Now , look at this number of polycarbonate , this stiffness is even lower , now what is the use of this stiffness , now when you have a polymer coil or a polymer substance , now if you impact , if you have a substance if you impact on that matrix or on the polymer substance; obviously , the chains are flexible , then it can absorb the energy applying , so it will not break.	10.910875883505504
If it fulfills any of the conditions , it is synthesized by condensation reaction or it has a function group in the backbone or you can imagine that it has been synthesized from monomers by elimination of small molecules , and if any of polymers which does not fulfill any of these criteria , we classify that as addition polymers.	9.439822561952264
It is also presumed that this binding energy is not totally a wasteful energy for the enzyme reactions.	9.14181881105292
In this case , you require initiator to be in the solvent and free radical kinetic normal can be applied.	8.39518547234229
Let us consider examples like benzene , we are talking about solvent.	8.251158688741137
By the exchange of ions the sodium gets exchanged with the calcium , you get water insoluble beads.	11.528144178668095
These two terms indicate the concentration term as well as the age term in the reactor.	9.111107000698379
You take a simple value of 0.5 and if you make calculation for x = 0.90, the erel required will be equal to 4..	12.55161210437962
So , if you design you can design highly reactive monomers , then they will have naturally high equilibrium constant.	7.183194487955237
So , that is for the first solution theta c .	8.88874686393827
That if you take a small block , then t g will be lower compared to the homopolymer , which have a higher molecular weight.	9.315023523548586
Now the look that sticks of the material , or the parts , depends upon several optical properties.	9.597200755288757
Both the binding sites can dissociate independently and lead to formation of a single enzyme substrate complex plus product.	9.806580442643142
You know all of us know about colligative properties you know from our physical chemistry knowledge s.	8.97695113258657
In those days the alcoholic fermentation enzyme was called as zymase although that kind of nomenclature is no longer valid.	10.030370644634901
By conjugated proteins we mean in addition to the amino acids the proteins chain will also be associated with some other non - amino acid molecules.	10.364532835774925
Now , if i change some other temperatures the solution will , you can draw some other lines.	10.217737878407675
So , what will be the combinatorial entropy for this mixture.	6.398131465584817
So , this polymers actually undergo molecular degradation in process , presence of moisture.	9.201503199942975
So , these are the so we can , what we can do.	6.938468903249248
The best way to ensure such clarity is that instead of taking one sample we take at least two or three dilutions of the same sample which are let us say two fold , four fold , six fold , known dilutions and the final reaction rate which has been obtained must be proportional to the dilution.	11.265825875845769
If the enzyme is stable at 70c , 70c is acceptable and can be considered as mild.	9.339651457767161
So , you should just remember that the , the structure of the cocatalyst also determines the rate of polymerization and also affect the rate of polymerization , and we will now see that.	9.215034932428464
So , it is , it is always preferred , that thermally stable polymers , the thermally stable polymers should be utilized in the polymerization.	6.561484252242394
So , what we are writing this as , this is interaction energy psi 1 1 epsilon 2 2 and this is epsilon 1 .	10.238374338330376
At higher substrate concentration the profile is more or less linear.	11.113660812314343
Now , what is the problem in that if you stop reaction as a level of say , 0.99 or 90 percent conversion.	8.34290311976776
Each of the reaction mechanism involves particularly the random ternary complex formation will involve nine rate constants four reversible and one irreversible step , nine rate constant and the expression will be quite complex.	10.44417995067057
So there is a partitioning effect.	8.220114816605388
We are not measuring ei in terms of protein contents.	11.384958775873068
And it has been used in making polymers by interfacial polymerization.	9.349416028708553
So , this is actually this carbon is having a planar structure irrespective of s p 2 whether it is radical , carbocation or carbon ion.	9.295505920006436
The basic concept is you have to choose an appropriate combination of biological and transducing elements that means choose a biological agents; we are emphasizing on immobilized enzymes which will recognize the anylate.	9.15860083674263
Now we have , and typical this values of kd s are.	9.87246425269825
Here also , because you have , for given molecular weight you have less number of c o n h group , the t m goes down.	8.021821924743323
Only thing is instead of packing the column with the particulate material what you are doing is the film is being wrapped along a core spaced by another sheet and then the whole core is inserted into a column.	10.859310435654454
Now , it can clearly be shown , the these value where the writing f a which is angle restriction from one angle is coming , we are writing these , it can be shown that 1 minus cos theta , it can be shown that now , in most cases the carbon - carbon bond are the bonds , theta is between 90 degree and 180 degree , so cos theta is less than 0; so obviously , r square f a would be greater than r square absolute.	9.752679219056631
You can introduce crystallinity by evaporating a polymer solutions slowly , and the another way we can introduce crystallite by drawing , which basically means stretching the polymer strain , so polymer chains at a particular temperature about t g , by which they can align , and then crystallize with each other.	10.758815545747419
Now if i have a react , if i have a monomer like styrene , you can see that in each of these cases anionic , cationic , and radical , the reactive species which is forming , because of the reaction of the monomer , with the previous reactive species , can be easily stabilized by a resonation structure in all the three cases.	10.173082879233458
If there are no restriction on one rotation obviously , it would have been somewhere in between in middle , exactly in middle , but because this gives when you go from middle towards the planar trans conformation , you get lower energy , lower potential energy whereas , you can go towards cis conformation you get higher energy.	10.44822780315339
This is typically done.	6.817172087319872
A is more informative in polymer; you will find that a is more probably more important than between these two constant.	9.949875799502797
So , k light scattering is proportional to d n by d c square; whereas , for x - ray scattering , it is due to difference in the scattering is due to difference in electron density.	9.172934682905463
This radical is not under if it do not undergo any termination reaction.	9.730354086720016
The quantity of enzyme immobilized on the surface is in fact very , very small compared to total surface area in which the whole enzyme is distributed inside the pores of the reactor.	8.757528955254267
Let us start with membrane osmometry.	6.218483889545757
So this gives you the reactor performance for a plug flow reactor following michaelis menten kinetics.	7.076147966325807
Now as we discussing that this side the solvent chemical potential is higher for a pure solvent than in polymer solution.	8.735720469121258
So , basically this region will be completely insoluble they face separate out.	7.276063903852771
Now , because the reaction is happening in the interface and at interface one one reactant is reacting with one of the other reactant.	11.173508101968263
Typically , what is done you start the reaction and keep it at low conversion so that build up is not too high not unmanageable.	11.712895633924154
Now , this at the interface react with phosgene forming this come out which again with reaction with this phenolate salt will form a dimer in this case and reaction will proceed further in this way.	9.685513281671279
So , eta s p by c is written as plus k h eta square c.	8.191586412887254
X at the inlet x is equal to zero at the outlet x has some value.	10.795738464724192
So , anything you do to stabilize the double bond it will lower the magnitude of the del h p.	8.643797279870125
So , with the different pore size available and we always know that it is the polymers are not that distinct as this they are also having different size or different molecular weights.	9.737433301350709
Now , if i want to measure the light scattering from a polymer solution; as you know , the light scattering is dominated by the molecules having larger sizes or larger molecular weight.	7.772838521591823
The t g is minus 63 degree , whereas if i replace this with a rigid phenyl backbone keeping everything else same , then the t g goes up.	8.534525610273077
Now , how to get more information with we can deduce from this.	6.716255790745649
The concentration of eab * is increased by significant amount and at lower energy level this equilibrium can be achieved.	10.57092526255296
So , now i move to a a new topic nomenclature.	8.898959672801023
Only certain molecules which have sufficient energy to undergo reaction will result into the product formation and it will be only a fraction of the total molecules that participate in the collisions process are able to yield the product.	10.185052299402063
In all these cases by following a typical pattern that is by understanding the reaction mechanism , the binding of the inhibitor and substrate to the enzyme and their interaction between each other one can really arrive at a rate expression.	8.986594821044536
Under steady state condition , the rate of mass transfer can be equated to the rate of biochemical reaction and then by analysis one can come under two extreme conditions; one under high substrate concentrations we get a lineweaver burk profile which is analogous to ordinary soluble enzyme kinetics and in the case of low substrate concentration that is in this case; low substrate concentration and high substrate concentration you get differences in slopes and the measurement of slope at two distinct stages of lineweaver burk plot gives you an estimate of the value of mass transfer coefficient.	10.144164819693039
So , just all this benefits , but the only disadvantage is that the price of maldi tof is very high.	8.680358906374398
On the other hand when we talk about enzymes these functions are highly specific.	6.62767546184657
And these , these are basically similar as in the case of transfer to monomers , so i am just going through quickly these different types of chain transfer.	9.313533748587677
There are a large number of such examples in the chemical literature or the bio chemical literature.	8.258042291829764
We see that except this initial part , the entire region for the entire conversional region , you have a linear relationship of degrees , average degrees of polymerization with time which is predicted by your reaction mechanism.	9.651151132033291
Now what is the difference between these two; this is cis arrangement of the repeat units whereas this is a trans arrangement of the repeat unit.	10.019292183395223
You understand that a low conversion it is , it was between 1.52 to 2, but at the temperature as the time goes up the polymer molecular weights increases increases.	10.876316583609537
The second point also builts in a number of phrases.	10.478574317113145
A typical profile; it can change from reaction to reaction.	8.797827660367528
When they are placed in a reactor how do they influence the performance of the system.	11.790587850634221
Then they is other way you can build them monomer molecular weight , because you have use the monomers to meet the polymer.	10.177962761404842
We plot as c bar is equal to c / q , the fraction of the total tracer which has been put in which emerges at any time given t and that is equal to c / q . dt will be equal to one or q is equal to zero to infinity c bar dt.	8.63355676234033
Now , this can further undergo several side reactions.	5.836757810740943
So , delta s m which is mixture minus s 1 minus s 2 would be given by minus k.	9.233308269783828
First , the monomer formation of complex between , formation of pi complex between the , with the nucleophilic olefin so , they and this is electro deficient.	12.63831158711932
If we cannot take out that heat which his generated by the exothermic reaction giving the polymerization process why effectively , then the temperature is raise and once the temperature we raise all this red constant will also vary.	10.018099904454528
And as a result what happened , you there is a local heat generation which actually can degrade your polymers which actually can degrade the polymer molecules and can generate coloration in your polymers.	9.987029363749896
What we will do now with the polymer.	7.933931914210303
So , what is what we will do this.	7.1081558753308665
With nineteen different amino acids probably the possibility of , variety of , diversity of proteins that are feasible is enormous almost approaching infinity.	11.072990397774236
So you can make different enzyme preparations starting from initial ph in the water medium which have different functional capabilities and by changing the enzyme memory with respect to ph.	10.01902333711226
So , if you just compare a simple example of polyethylene , c h 2 c h 3 polypropylene , polystyrene and four vinyl anthrosin.	8.810941806626818
Such a kind of a system where although the second substrate b reacts with ea to give you the first product and the ternary complex is not a very stable entity is classified into the thorell and chance mechanism.	9.609693897076623
In last lecture , we started lattice theory of solutions of small molecules and then , we introduced the thermodynamic probability and boltzmann equation , how to get this combinatorial entropy from number of distinguishable this degenerate arrangements of a system.	8.8264205222961
There is another point besides the fractional conversion; the enzyme quantity required and the space time required.	8.894861767558677
So , it is similar to the ideal composition copolymerization.	6.206929341845142
So by getting the inhibition data on the bi - substrate reaction kinetics either by choosing one product or the other product one can get a set of data and from which one can conclude by the ordered ternary complex formation or a random ternary complex formation identifying ping - pong bi - bi or the ping pong mechanism directly from the effect of substrate concentration on the reaction rate itself can lead you to that kind of scenario.	9.34803508884708
You need to make analysis of the enzyme reaction at the ph enzyme rate profile , detailed analysis to get the pk values of the amino acid residues involved and thereby make deduction.	11.072961794781845
Obviously , the reactivity of the ions , end ions are higher , so the r p will be higher compared to if the ion - pairs are in contact , or will be tight in case of , if you have considered same solvent , same say , non - polar solvent.	10.087407710535212
In the final article , final application , the molecular rate will vary from your target molecular rate.	9.71454567602249
All those cases , variety of cases will come under the category of competitive inhibition and the purpose is that the presence of inhibitor must reduce because reversible inhibition depends on the concentrations of the two species , inhibitor and substrate and they will affect the binding mechanism.	10.518293882813815
They will be of different molecular size and i will talk about the molecular weight; why you need more definition of molecular weight and so on.	8.419720370936261
A very classical example , where at a substrate concentration of greater than 0.1m , 0.1m is not a very high substrate concentration , is about say 3.4 or 3.5 %.	10.899384031542757
This will be equal to p = s0 - s = xs0 therefore you can also write in terms of product concentration kmlns0 / s0 + p = k 2e0t if you look at these equations you can use the reactor performance data of a batch reactor.	9.833078219735418
See if you have given m n has 10000 and a polymer is supplied to you , given you know the structure and from the structure you know that this is made by step polymers , then you even is 1000.	12.806229635722618
Then the cationic propagating species will react immediately with the water molecule and terminate the polymerization or propagating chain.	8.849601018204455
So , now we have know where from a polymer is made.	6.790376867373741
Once the steady state has been achieved at time t equal to zero , the fractional conversion is x0 and after the elapse of time t fractional conversion declines as a result of enzyme deactivation and that is the fractional conversion xt.	10.343992847509407
It gives you 1 plus root k.	9.396129741396978
If we consider . . . enzyme reactor we can safely say that michaelis menten kinetics provides us a basis for carrying out a universally accepted kinetics for enzyme catalyzed reactions and so therefore we will assume in most cases v is equal to v = k2e0s / km + s wherever we are talking of immobilized enzyme we must also clearly understand that these two terms k2 and km are denoted by prime indicating only that they are immobilized enzyme parameters and not the soluble parameters.	10.661141636496412
For example if the ph control is required cstr is preferable and then the nature of the substrate , the nature of the enzyme and the form of the enzyme.	8.31946952644554
So , this is the expression which now we got from the angle restriction; what we will be the next lecture.	8.507247708026592
In fact the immobilized enzyme preparation can be tailored so as to have at least minor adjustment of the operational parameters.	9.383719792820164
This indicates that in the case of thorell and chance mechanism k3 term from the reaction mechanism is much , much greater than k - .	8.283653926415138
Similarly the same time you lose the processibility to the way difficult to process.	9.55322759077389
And you should be knowing the polymers , which i have covered in today s lecture.	9.128052217720677
So basically in this case , every monomer unit has a trans arrangement.	8.58381140711288
So , it gives you the option of choosing a definite polymer or particular polymers for your choice of applications and of course , you know not more often and not it comes with a lower cost.	9.062118267054647
Now , once you form this , again react with the monomer and form the initiating species , which let us write in next page.	7.523360241853376
Hence , this calibration is mostly done with a mono dispersed synthesized with a precise mono dispersed molecular weight like living anionic polymerization.	9.502185277127976
Now what mean by chain dimension.	10.856660900006492
If you require a very strong binding force use covalent coupling.	8.175190947607238
While in the case of pfr or the plug flow reactor the regeneration of the carrier is simple because after the immobilized enzyme is exhausted one can stop for a while regenerate the carrier , reimmobilize the system and reuse.	9.433966271952977
Also if sometimes happens , in the most cases it happens; that one single homopolymers do not posses , the required or the desired property we are looking for.	10.368191872607905
Now , there could be other points which are also having the same distance r; you can have other values r across this three d coordinate.	9.630428937958838
Now this three thousand , just to understand and bring it into a systematic feature , have been classified into six different classes.	9.457057116055678
But , most likely the increase is in t g.	8.33997562971065
So , we can get in x by x n x total.	7.700576509478984
Now in the case of enzymatic catalysis we must bear clearly in our mind that one of the characteristic features is that enzymes has a certain ligand binding sites and more specifically substrate binding sites.	8.564814075466211
So , they may changing one parameter may also change the effect on the other parameter.	9.327689720038439
So , the weight , if you take all the chains and plot the weight fraction in five maximum , where x is equals to or to the average degrees of polymerization.	8.58493763774247
So in a very simplistic way if you can take a double reciprocal plot one can analyze the experimental data that are obtained on the rate of reaction as a function of substrate concentration and verify the hypothesis.	9.975062614453584
Then we went on and studied how the degrees of polymerization would vary with equilibrium constant in a closed system , and we found that the importance of equilibrium constant.	8.771576618131565
So , though this is a natural polymer , but if we imagine monomers like this from which they are formed and in this case because you imagine or you hypothesized that these are formed to a condensation reaction , most of this natural polymers are classified as a condensation polymer.	10.037020001574357
So , in this case , below this point before this point , m 1 is getting incorporated in the chain faster.	6.362587662196594
Now , in this case you have another possibility where you have a meso dyad; another is a racimic dyad.	7.744515532305348
They contain certain polyphenolics and polypeptides and they react during storage to give you a haze and hazy beer nobody likes.	11.513619327067788
So , which actually have in , being the surface biocompatible or hemocompatible.	9.651761494740946
It is a comparatively simplistic situation.	8.882096415717298
But this is a very loaded statement in the sense particularly a deviation from the original michaelis menten hypothesis which states of equilibrium of e - s.	10.083061796907195
Two of the definitely undesirable features of an enzyme as catalyst is they are relatively fragile in nature and with very mild deviations from their normal operating conditions they can be deactivated.	11.227271288753343
It could be acceptance of electron giving rise to a radical anion or removal of an electron , which gives to radical cation , which two of which might combine to give you a dianion or a dication which can further initiate the chain reactions from both the sides.	9.22542059972928
They consist of many repeating structural units , the term polymers derived from greek words poly and meros , poly means many and meros means part.	10.667581672390435
The next monomer comes and get inserted here same mechanism and you get a linear poly olefins in this case.	9.682676170745564
What do we mean by shape.	9.497756014332461
On the other side the same performance can also be judged by purely kinetic analysis.	8.356185487046071
This is the volume of a polymer coil one polymer coil and this is the molecular weight; that means mass of one polymer coil; that means intrinsic viscosity relates inversely to the density; it is inverse to the density of the random coil.	9.915141490473257
With the background in the biochemical metabolics you will appreciate that most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions in practice in the living cells are not single substrate reactions.	8.566810940038133
So , strain percentage is given by d l by l into 100 so , that is the strain percentage.	10.855317499524993
So , maintaining in a large scale industrial set up is quite difficult.	9.002507117887538
But it can influence the catalytic capacity of the enzyme molecule in total.	11.234131521609372
The factors which are responsible for their deactivation , the approaches that are available for stabilizing the enzymes , the role of active sites or ligand binding sites on the enzymes will be dealt in functional nature.	10.129012394514472
Crystallization is being used as the method which is a very favorable method for purity of the product.	11.953029853663688
Secondly convert the recognition process into a physico - chemical change which either directly or indirectly generates the current.	11.141904096041076
So , naturally its reaction is done such a way that phenol is taking out from the system and reaction is done at very high temperature.	8.670096994213004
That is only the advantage in this case , but in this advantage , you have two , have an extra molecule in the reaction.	9.87056068520645
One is the relative quantity of substrate to km.	7.686069783627652
The numerator in the thiele modulus which gives you the reaction rate constant is increasing because the concentration is high.	10.300833276880905
By taking a buffered reaction mixture at a higher ph the concentration of hydrogen ions in the reaction mixture can be maintained at a very low level and the reaction can be driven in the forward direction.	9.550425227871278
And they also basically act as electron donating group so increase the electron density in the double bond.	9.275225539971489
Two of the reactions which have been carried in such a reactor is one is continuous oxidation of ethanol using permeabilized yeast cells.	10.417342768270633
So , this is known as zimm plot; this is very unique way of plotting this three dimension 3 d data into two dimensional using the help of a arbitrarily chosen constant and we can get this information from this zimm plot.	8.856751998651825
Then in such case we would like very high fractional conversion.	8.757744413427876
Now you can seen this viscoelasticity behavior if you have a silly putty , the toy material silly putty in home , but i do not have that material with him.	11.00350659670117
So , r 1 has 0.5 and r 2 is 0.4.	11.241121967280389
These 3 peaks , 1, 2, 3 for this o methoxy protons , for this o methoxy group , and they also not same depending upon whether , they are syndiotatctic or hydrostatic or a isotactic , they are chemical shift value will defer.	11.815265571055665
Basically you cannot say just your polymer is weather able or not.	9.643593990045638
So a change in the activation energy over a range of temperature also indicates the diffusional limitation behavior.	9.564935702156756
We see that in most cases the enzyme undergoes loss of activity during immobilization.	8.973104649668663
One more time we want to discuss in optical properties; birefringence.	11.654494079666275
If this is the distance x on either sides that means the distance of the surface from the center is x on either sides.	10.035467814745155
We have seen in last page that pdi is 1 plus p which is always close to 2, or if the molecular weight is lower , it would be less than .	9.234848491101511
Most important non covalent interaction which involves in the conformation of the protein molecule is hydrogen bonds , very large number of hydrogen bonds.	10.135874457640448
We have got this earlier.	8.846304429881913
So , these are some of the examples of uv visible spectroscopy in polymers.	6.577563950523547
He proposed that at least there must be three sites of different points of interaction on an enzyme active site.	9.051664652984824
So , as we know that there are a different types of vibrations possible like stretching and bending , and this is important that interaction of matter with ir radiation offers only when this vibrations produces a change in hyper movement.	9.776992414653316
The two enzyme catalyzed reactions are coupled in a cell in such a way that the cofactor which is used in one direction is recycled back through another reaction with which it is linked and the total equilibrium is in favor of the desired intermediate the direct part to be synthesized by the cell.	9.239937589556623
I should say that , welcome to the 15th lecture of this polymer chemistry course , and in this course in this lecture today , we will continue our discussion on polymer polymerization processes , different processes we start discussing in the last lecture.	8.795574293460806
As a matter of fact almost all drugs which are required to be given for action at brain as the site the concentrations are very high almost 4 to eight times more that of the same drug if it is used at some other site in the body.	9.505390768285901
This has been one of the attributes in the case of immobilized enzyme preparation where many times we require a particular operational ph for certain other conditions.	9.887933543322072
Now , what is the chance that each of this vacant cells is a solvent molecule or each of this contacts is giving a polymer solvent contact , which is again given by the volume fraction of the solvent molecule because , its segment size and the size of a solvent molecule is same.	8.419720343214212
In the case of a cstr , you can use a soluble enzyme or along with a soluble or insoluble substrate by carrying out in a cstr and coupling the cstr with the ultra filtration module.	8.808341311961634
Particularly in the case of multisubstrate reactions which we will be dealing subsequently where more than one substrate molecule takes part in the enzyme catalyzed reaction their kinetic mechanism is also understood by the role of certain external effector molecules.	10.877554627622168
E can be formed by all the possible pathway involving n - 1 steps.	8.443365048096872
So , if your molecular weight goes up then your critical temperature also will go down.	7.092689134467585
The high performance polymers are having the highest performance and so does the price.	11.355874052128664
Here in the case of a batch reactor the accumulation is volume multiplied by rate of change of substrate concentration that is v . ds / dt.	8.616333765315362
It has to be removed because these l amino acids which were produced were useful either for food applications or animal feed or sometime pharmaceuticals and therefore you cannot leave unconverted or unused proteins in the feed stream and the number of stages involved in purifications will lead to loss of yield for the amino acid as high as fifty to sixty percent.	10.594633276088741
So , it is basically these value depends the cut off value where this angular dependence starts depends upon the wavelength of the incident light which we are using.	8.054130067326215
Ultimately a major portion of enzyme activity must be retained.	10.729865413385973
There are some polymers or few polymers which comes from natural sources like polysaccharide cellulose and more often not these natural polymers , the polymers which comes from natural source are very useful.	9.451109415449633
As a matter of fact the urease , this system is usually not very effective and the first four ones are considered to be very effective and the system is not commercialized but in many laboratories they have been tested , used and reported.	9.312310617708578
How it will react.	12.010268474275467
Now the key issue is that all these functions in the living cell , may it be a microbial cell , may it be a plant cell or it might be an animal cell , they are mediated by the catalyst known as enzymes.	9.391157131537952
So overall klam will have unit of per second.	9.885995791031663
Most cases you get from petroleum resources , ultimately from a crude oil or in some cases you also get a monomers from renewable resources or bio resources.	10.582062145873426
And this reduction of t g from original 100 degree for polymethyl methyl acryculate we be lower reduction means the t g value will becoming down more and more if you have more and more monomer in the medium.	10.323136303092983
Then obviously there will be attraction between the two polar polarities and there will be possibilities for the copolymerization will be much easier.	12.029132155446803
The effect of mass transfer is demonstrated in the performance of immobilized enzyme reactor by virtue of the effect of linear feed velocity in the case of plug flow reactors or the effect of agitation speed in the case of a stirred tank reactor or the effect of particle dimensions or particle size on the performance of enzyme reactor and these parameters influences the rate of enzyme reaction or the performance of the immobilized enzyme reactor demonstrate the role of mass transfer in the performance of the enzymatic catalysis.	9.8734969341451
The other is in the proximity of the cavity there must be some functional groups which can do catalyses and we know that the enzymes also follow the same kind of reaction mechanisms as chemical catalysts do or acid base catalysis , covalent catalysis , or proximity effects; all those there are experienced in the enzymatic reactions and the similar concepts are being used to synthesize large molecules to mimic the catalytic functions.	9.866352677001617
Rate of mass transfer , rate of reaction are identical.	11.23919667877537
So if let us say the error involved is less than 10 % , i think there is no harm in making an assumption of zero order or first order.	9.732053573328264
The double reciprocal plot in the presence of non - competitive inhibitor is given as 1 / v = km / vm ( 1 + i / ki ) . 1 / s + 1 / vm ( 1 + i / ki ) in the case of a non - competitive inhibitor both the slope as well as intercept will undergo a change and both this slope and intercept has increased by a magnitude 1 + i / ki and therefore if you look at the pattern of the lineweaver burk plot you get an increasing concentration of i.	6.304130888759439
So , you can consider these , reactions of this with isobutylene and you get propagating chain like this , which can again react with alkyl halide.	9.448984716989736
The mechanism and the kinetics in case of emulsion polymerization do not follow a normal chain reaction polymerization kinetics or mechanism , as was the case for the earlier 4, 5 process , we just talked about this mechanism and kinetics for emulsion process are quiet different and complex , and still not completely understood.	10.275254712824172
The conformation is neither the same what was available in the case of enzyme molecule.	9.600451558258014
And in , like in monomer case , the resulting species out of or as a result of chain transfer reaction is same as the initiating species.	10.113186221212542
As the time goes , you can take a monomer and do a reaction like this , r n x a polymer and then , you can add a second monomer.	10.055284935328032
So , if you start from this expression we can write rt ln this side the left hand side.	6.369091960835775
So these three phenomena are intrinsically someway related because they end up in a similar kind of a kinetic expression.	9.499576957284663
So , i can write q for m 1 q for m 2 for 1, 1, 1 e m 2, you can get the expression from k 1 1 for k 1 1 k 2 and so the ratio you get these two , this because is the same radical 1 and .	9.761425581862856
Smaller thiele modulus means the rate of diffusion is smaller.	11.499046618191112
Now , this double bond is free to undergo chain polymerization.	6.475133061468251
The carrier should also have a large number of sites for binding of enzyme.	7.220055864669185
So , you essentially get copolymer at the beginning.	5.84000582384824
Oh plus h , it gives you 1.	17.90922316693642
Langmuir isotherm is based on a theoretical development.	17.069225879340088
In case of chain growth polymerization , our chain grows only by addition of reactive species , or the monomer at the end.	9.097787427392822
So , more monomer is undergoing polymerization reaction , so higher is the conversation.	10.829052076766626
No . net charge is zero.	8.333112542863539
Whereas , in this case , case of polyethylene terephthalate individual monomers which are coming here and making the polymer they are called structural units.	8.91089845808592
This is just a summary of the whole thing.	8.108916472901601
And if the glass transition temperature also depend on the t g , sorry , tacticity of the homopolymers , and for example if you look at the t g of syndiotactic of poly methyl methacrylate is different than isotactic , whereas copolystyrene is not different.	9.676411037112272
Also a major factor in the limitations of the application of soluble enzymes in industry has also been the soluble nature of enzymes that means they have to be used in water soluble form.	10.292493076641719
Now , if we go back and look at this or compare this initiation reaction which we wrote earlier , and you can argue that we are not , we are not talking about , or we are taking , not taking this reaction in the consideration , when we are determining r i.	9.029045708956662
We are considering this parameter the.	8.880964826895168
In such a situation for a cstr you can very easily write the reactor performance.	7.422049165252965
There is point to consider reaction kinetics; you design your reactor system based on mass transfer diffusional requirements.	9.578149668865295
In this case , polyamides can be synthesized by different set of monomers or self condensation of amino acids.	7.682581899699561
Now , this radical is get generated from a initiator species , now if i want to find out how fast this radical generation happen , we can write this rate equation , which is basically dissociation constant , multiplied by the , this follows fast order kinetic , so its multiplied by initiator concentration , which will give you , this on interrogation , where i 0 is the concentration of unity initiator at t is equal to 0, and this is some other t.	10.280707244182803
It could be oxygen , ether , it could be ester , it could be amide or it would be any of these things , ok.	9.896186910098955
So , this is not valid for polymer long polar a polar polymer and polar solvent as usually , which is usually valid for non polar solvent and non polar and non polar amorphous and non polar solvent.	9.082438321812258
But one of the characteristic features is that all the parameters at the exit stream are same as in the reactor itself.	10.385755039110954
It has only elongation from 1 to 3 percent.	9.388475312062754
Unless the reactant molecules cross the barrier they cannot get converted to the product.	9.999461325528964
That means enzyme concentration in the solid phase and not the e0 because as a result of conformational changes the enzyme concentration interms of activity can get altered.	9.064747413348163
So , weak scattering happened because of the minute fluctuation in the solvent density and because of the solute molecule itself , the concentration of solute molecules fluctuate; either because of the translational motion brownian motion of the solute molecules or if it is a polymer large molecule there will be conformational changes.	11.907437287742349
That is because this monomer is appearing in the rate expression of the initiation reaction , as well in ionic polymerization , whether in the case of radical polymerization this monomer was absent in the initiation reaction.	8.52691994608362
Vm v0 = km ( 1 + i / ki ) + s ( 1 + i / ki ) to simplify , to look at the effect on km and vm values , if we divide both the numerator and denominator by ( 1 + i / ki ) s.	5.6434224866820895
This magnitude will depend on two factors one is turn over number and as we already know that turn over number of these reactions is pretty high , orders of magnitude of few thousand.	10.805316682972208
Our total enzyme concentration e0 will be equal to e0 = e + eh + eh2 + ehs the total enzyme is present in four different species : the free enzyme , the partially reduced , fully reduced and the substrate bound which is involved in binding only with the eh.	10.347394340669746
So , at the end , you get a dead polymer.	5.572676328661477
T and such an analysis is erroneous in nature.	9.138728457904254
Then you cannot say that the break down of e - s into product is a very slow step and a reasonable rate of break down will disturb the equilibrium.	8.462455922955487
At t 2, you have again , this is the binodal points and these are two are the spinodal points.	9.784804419953717
Whereas , below t g , it is glassy , which have higher elastic modulus and more it is more of a elastic behavior is like a elastic behavior then , immediately after the t g it is becomes soft but , because of high viscosity thus , the polymer chains steel cannot move fast each other very easily.	11.402685191548063
It should be too low.	8.772605668815254
The conversion as a result of biochemical reaction is v ( 2pr ) dx.	10.09658526028311
So , at theta goes up , p theta goes down in value.	8.861610416335605
If suppose you want to adsorb by ionic binding , you need a carrier which possesses charges.	9.759483560063536
And , average of that , so , this is 86; not the molecular rate or the repeating rate.	10.769505570324121
This is the term same term.	7.730395732698333
Now , these are the points to minima , who have the , which has the , which have the common tangent , they are called binodal points or bimodal composition , and the inflection point which is the boundary between metastable unstable region.	10.687601084475077
So , just recap last 2 lectures , we discussed in detail effect of temperature on the rate of polymerization and molecular weight.	7.061226007202035
Also this hydro peroxides; for example t - butyl hydro peroxide , it can also undergo homiletic cleavage forming two radicals.	10.288701151107155
One of the most important motivating factors for looking at immobilized enzyme was the operational stability.	7.196853970819399
So the surface , the titanium which is present at the surface is that is five coordinated titanium three plus and that has a vacant d - orbital.	8.27547562054761
The second group of entrapment method is on microencapsulation and in the case of micro encapsulation , as i mentioned earlier , the enzyme is enclosed within a semi permeable membrane; polymeric membrane permeable to substrate and product.	10.144673078132342
Define degree of polymers , its , it is the number of structural units present in a polymer molecule.	10.592012726970934
So , you can also write this as 6 amino caproic acid.	6.160793307713053
So , obviously , the intramolecular long range interactions , steric interactions try to expand the chain , whereas intermolecular long range interactions are basically try to contract , the chain and to bring in to the unperturbed dimension.	8.592069759623222
So , you have to do actually stop starts stop start stop reaction where you start the reactions stop at low conversion and then you stop and take the polymer out.	8.678924611798372
Now , talked about how the polymers are done you know.	8.552109779087322
These three interacting sites let us consider that they are the interaction sites.	11.470611659656923
So , they are amine , secondary arylamines function by hydrogen donation , and they act has chain terminators of peroxide decomposition , decomposer.	9.610150211377613
So , this is 0 angle , and this is 180 angle , this is 90 degree.	10.173243017405811
Now , r i is , this is for thermal initiation.	7.62274126970747
So , obviously , now if the model was considering that this two can be overlapped in a line , obviously if they cannot the chain has to expand a little bit , or in other words the conformations which had list number of intersection , will have higher probability than the conformations which has more number of self interactions intersections.	9.532736319178328
The purpose is that the presence of inhibitor makes the binding of the substrate difficult in a competitive mode.	9.113138985252622
Now , these diacid chloride reactions with dial or diamine there are very fast and k r of the order of 10 to the power 4 to 10 to the power of 5 l in term of per second inverse , which means they are much fast reaction compared to the normal step polymerization reactions.	7.671570631481077
In my first presentation i mentioned about the specificity.	9.935898300725016
Some more examples with the names of the polymers this nylon , pvc , hdpe , ldpe now , just to compare the values of the polymers with metals.	11.77840537812925
The reactor performance can be simply considered on the basis of thermal deactivation and if you replace in your idealized reactor performance equation instead of e0, if you just transfer it to e0.e - kdt where t is the operational time , you can get the modified reactor performance of the effect of operational stability on the reactor performance.	10.06675542593248
It can react with any of the dimmers or it can react with the trimer itself making the possibilities more and more.	9.77553198264659
Now you can integrate this; you integrate this , you get c is equal to eta .	11.430643372792359
Now , as i said very beginning that when you make a polymer , polymer molecules and polymer samples always comes with a distribution of molecular weight , not all the chains are of same size , there are not of same sizing , not all the polymers are same size , same.	9.702128067262285
Now , if to slow down this reaction one strategy is used very often is to make a bulk.	8.7225486182831
It is not absolute method; it is a relative method.	10.418340094022684
Another way to look at this kinetic expression is , just like we have been looking under all the cases of single substrate reaction , double reciprocal plots which will also give us the magnitude of all the kinetic parameters that are involved.	10.928800699631315
We have also mentioned last time that if you want to analyze the simultaneous mass transfer and biochemical reaction in immobilized enzyme particle it can be expressed assuming a cylindrical pore model.	9.050424815102973
Km will tend to increase or the slope of the profile will increase without affecting the point of intersection on y - axis which is represented as 1 / vi.	11.906785658936007
Then finally , we get a polymer which has in head tail head tail arrangement.	10.291422181665709
Hence there is tremendous effect of the solvent and the counters ion in case of ring opening polymerization as well , as was in the case of the linear ionic polymerization of the double bond.	10.519140021200702
In fact one can make a hypothetical computation and then we take up an assignment to design an enzyme reactor or for that matter any process equipment.	10.637645808938474
Now , in this lecture i plan to cover discuss the general characteristics of ionic chain polymerization , and while discussing i will compare how this ionic chain polymerization compares with radical chain polymerization.	6.990960016157554
So , this would the mole volume of fraction of the solvent and this would be the volume fraction of the polymer.	7.417967413249921
The other type of possible initiation is the thermally induced self initiation; that means , the monomer itself , on thermal or on heating can gives rise to , or they can generate radical , but this not a very common way of generating radical; this is , has been proved only for , in the case of styrene.	10.576231670501606
Depending upon this value you get the relation between t c and m e.	8.695103032605928
Let us go and try to derive that.	8.011191587869156
And if you decrease the molecular weight; obviously , there will loss of , lot properties including mechanical properties , thermal properties and so on.	7.504604829010018
Obviously , in air the decomposition rate , and the decomposition will be a much lower temperature , compare with situation , where the heating is the temperature is increase under , nitrogen organ.	12.00126320551396
Then they didn t have much understanding of the stability of the enzyme as well.	8.944829817782217
Now what it says , it says that , the reactivity of a propagating species , only depend on the monomer with unit which is present at the growing chain end.	9.267240101892725
The porosity of the gel can be maintained by the concentration of the cross linking agent that is bis.	9.563780845255625
Some of the enzymes which are fairly stable , thermally stable , they can be held at the room temperature and you can carry out the crosslinking say for example in one to two hours , where as certain other enzymes which are very sensitive to heat , they require to be reacted at 4c and then the reaction requires a time interval of at least twenty four hours.	10.383762913232271
Now , anti oxidants are added or designed , which cannot attack or prevent all these steps , but it might prevent some step in between.	9.75385927980323
These examples prove that the assumption we made earlier , in terms of equal reactivity of function group , is valid.	10.010813057434149
So , the combination of per sulfate plus diamine gives the radical.	7.120302025425723
Now , if i write generic way , h plus plus a , generic structure of a monomer , it gives you ch 3 ch y , cationic species , and a minus.	9.50090532196282
So , they are very you know high performing polymers this poly sulfonesor polyether sulfones , they are amorphous in nature the t g is around one they are also very high t g 180 to 230 and they have continuous use temperature is between 150 to 20.	10.765628089674342
Now , entropy , sorry , enthalpy of mixing.	7.114033037221126
We have not started discussion on molecular weight determination.	7.922395977088362
I must stress again that at least these two applications have lesser implication as for the economic systems.	10.034352331772304
The whole computation becomes based on biological molecules.	9.031877520120682
H and.	10.295898126586875
But the spiral wound module operates some where closer to only closer to plug flow behavior reactor and not exactly as a plug flow reactor.	8.271415910063826
So , we know value of r i we also can find out the value of i.	8.302071495223265
So , whatever at the end of your processing steps , you will get the same polymer in the property which was related to the molecular weight , of your target molecular weight.	8.398922018340976
The catalytic behavior of enzymes can be probably best illustrated by chemical reaction rate theory.	10.338942507744
Then , if a gas has to pass through this medium , then it has to take longer path , like this , compare to a path where , you do not have this clay materials.	10.564761452929057
When you say when you are immobilizing on the walls of the tube then they don t operate really on the hollow fiber reactor.	9.707555445883447
Cross - linking is when you have a branch or you have a connection between two chains.	13.325107833858503
If you can write down the rate constant k1, k2 and k - 1 for the three reaction steps that are involved in this case , one can write down the rate expression using equilibrium hypothesis.	9.880996085024492
Another major advantage is the hydrolysis can catalyse synthetic reactions.	8.825187792287137
And , this happens , as i mentioned this , for linear polyesters , polyamides , polyurethanes , polyureas , polycarbonates , where their functional groups have , groups which are prone to hydrolyze.	9.364618378961541
For example , if i take , i will just give you a write a general way.	6.551560968245175
I will talk about glass transition later in more detail but at present , just glass transition means temperature at which they becomes flexible , ok.	9.765880862075168
You can actually use these coordination polymers to make high molecular weight , high density polyethylene or ultra - high molecular polyethylene.	8.536270544480482
Now , this translational entropy does not depend too much on the monomers structure.	7.389296626515553
Now , x - ray is very small in compared to a visible light which is having 400 nanometer to 800 nanometer , it is about only 0.1 nanometer whereas , the neutron is about 0.1 nanometer to 2 nanometer.	11.632031613746364
If you notice the half life of an enzyme in a living cell you can make certain indirect calculations.	9.903858547261153
So , when we talking about polymer distribution , it contains the monomer , dimmer , trimmer sample as well.	7.76482066107881
To this emulsion we add the hydrophobic monomer dissolved in the same solvent.	8.560486346868693
For example we have the products of kappa factor for e we will have for es and also for et.	9.84373744830962
You can write then with the assumption of ( dx / dt ) = 0 ( e0 ) = ( e ) + ( x ) x is enzyme substrate complex.	8.904898853632572
Here in the case the effect is almost very similar to what we call as strain effect but while the substrate enzyme binding takes place at the active site there are still some unfavorable interactions at the active site of the substrate that means the substrate molecule in the vicinity of the active site is not very comfortable in terms of its interactions.	10.12009919543744
So , that they can move towards the detector.	7.449681696659521
If the conformational changes are more favorable to the factors that are responsible for reduction in activation energy either by strain or any other mechanism that we discussed earlier by entropic or enthalpic changes which reduce the energy of activation for the enzyme catalyzed reaction , it might also lead to favorable conformational change.	9.2014210383319
And precipitating the polymer and then waying the polymer to find out the healed , which means waste is the monomer , so by which you can know what is the monomer present or how much monomer is reacted directly do at from a solution.	11.354526341973676
Now , in case of dilute polymer solvent , there is unlikely that two polymer chains should be so close , so polymer polymer interaction would be this exclusion will be will be less in low probability.	9.704635067588145
Even at a smaller internal energy level the product formation can take place.	9.039035790737426
The other parameter which is temperature also influences in a multiple fashion.	9.17722578314342
Km becomes k and s gets cancelled and then degree of inhibition will be i / ki . ( 1 + i / ki ).	7.5388112369969456
Fourthly we also assumed that the substrate concentration is much , much larger than enzyme concentration which is in most cases a very true assumption and the enzyme concentration being a catalyst is very , very small compared to the reactant as is also the case in most of the catalytic reactions.	9.524723854500806
That will always be in comparable concentration and therefore it will be always useful to have understanding of the mechanism.	11.406476086426355
Now their ratio will determine which product gets dominated and that will get determined by the difference in the activation gives few energy between the two molecule where we can write like this , where this del del l star and del del h star is the difference in the activation energy different activation entropy and this is the difference in the activation energy between the two routes.	10.243561953734591
You do your reaction best possible way and that is your limitation.	9.547521937368106
Now , if we do reaction such a way that all the raft regions or did take part in the polymerization reaction , we choose the raft region such as , such a way that every raft reagent is participating in the transfer reaction.	7.886552530007051
So , what is the value if i.	5.455960197648629
Second thing is that only those patterns which end up in synthesis of that species and not the patterns that lead to the break down or which go away from the species will be considered.	10.025342675150828
Now , how do you get the values of t c.	6.606906819424224
L where.	16.036648135789942
So , they do not flow.	6.561422130160294
So , basically because of surface scattering and reflection your transmission comes down.	6.981115440646425
Then the fuel cost; it makes no difference.	8.12401903923751
So , because m 1 is more reactivity , you will get in the chain much faster , so you will get eco polymer , which reach in m 1 compare to m .	9.8217164359516
So , can you make a polymer like this , this will form secondary oxomium ion this is , now we have been talking that we need a very a very strong acid because if you counter ion have sufficient acid is not that strong then this counter ion will have sufficient necleophillicity to either set up the oxonium ion or a proton and stop the reaction there itself.	10.109676821345339
This x is where the maximum comes.	11.765293710617549
So , that is one example of fr additive , which basically act as a fire retardant additives by absorbing heat , by releasing water.	8.318632292420178
Now , out of this x number of a groups , one is at the end unreacted , and x minus 1 have reacted to form linkages.	10.145634249664164
If a is one which we just we discussed it is for highly elongated rod like molecule , then m v would be same as m w.	9.404707763649428
That is the upcoming feature of biotechnology and among these groups of biocatalyst enzymes play a very significant role.	9.046735792177714
So , let us continue this redox initiator discussion.	6.972795122414427
This acts on not only on d - glucose , but it accepts only - d - glucose and a - d - glucose is just not accepted.	10.718465021410445
The km is not altered as a result of mass transfer , diffusion.	10.391498479426756
It is in chiral , the chiral center as well.	7.985259909405857
You are generating more chains at the end of the polymerization , which means that you are breaking a chain and as a result the molecular weight or the number average degrees of a polymers , polymerization is lower than , if there was no transfer reaction present.	8.816207348594409
That means in the case of plug flow reactor tow is equal to s0 0 to x dx / k . s; classical balance equation which gives you the performance of a plug flow reactor and from this one can write s = s0e - kt.	9.043015655998671
Part of the substrate which got protonated by binding with the hydrogen ions becomes a dead end complex as happened in the case of a competitive inhibitor and therefore you get a similar profile which gives you a km value.	10.31020847904018
What happened , homopolymerization become very low , as long as styrene is present , because the copolymerization rate of vinyl acetate with styrene , it is much faster than the homopolymerization.	11.677276593401835
So , for mono dispersed gaussian current this is the equation where s square is the radius of gyration; sometimes , it also written as r g square which is basically radius of gyration.	9.32975191474638
So , i can write the degree of polymerization , like r p by r t , which gives k p m by k t.	8.253612233235433
Then we can make this polymer surface hemocompatible or anti - thrombogenity , whatever we called that of anti - fogging to protein , whatever name we can give.	10.096532092157394
We also looked at the relative quantity of enzyme required in cstr to pfr which is given by this ratio and here you will notice that as we increase the fractional conversion the relative quantity of enzyme required for a first order regime significantly increases in the case of cstr.	7.687769763299783
Now , if we write two pair; two asymmetric pair of carbon atom , now this is the horizontal line.	9.373525273051081
One of the most typical examples of enzyme catalyzed reaction which was responsible for the elucidation of induced fit model was the hexose kinase.	9.250563435109
Then , what happens there is some time , there is a possibility that one of the monomers will preferably partition in the core for say emulsion polymerization.	9.389441743934723
There are hardly any unimolecular reactions as far as an enzyme is concerned expecting certain isomerases because most of the reactions are bi or trimolecular.	10.50140377699276
But in this case , the each step the polymer can take or the bond can take is the length of the bond.	8.008801196128747
So , you cannot stress.	6.864449173417591
From the two forms it gives you two different kinds of cross linked enzyme preparation.	10.150466503130128
So , you can get x n multiplied by the molecular unit of structural unit , plus , the molecular unit of , molecular unit of the groups of the end.	8.76545791711683
The yield can vary depending on the method of immobilization , depending on the carrier and the stability of the enzyme itself with respect to the conditions of immobilization.	8.718164722667156
So , the reaction is very fast , so you can do it at low temperature in room temperature and it is usually done at a temperature between 0 to 50 degree centigrade.	7.7092641720901485
You can actually take advantage if you can do this chain transfer or chain termination by reversible way , where you can utilize this reversible chain transfer termination reaction and carryout leaving reaction and carryout a leaving radical polymerization , where your poly dispersity index is much lower compared to the normal polymer radical.	9.90988939926218
So , that is the original flammability of polymer materials.	6.682826755677912
Now , you have incident radiation coming and it is getting scattered from here , and it is going to the detector at 0 angle.	9.617895790520745
For example , if i have compare two symmetric substitution like two substitutes , a f verses 1 and substitutes a f; the unsymmetrical have the higher t g.	7.456919822589937
The physical reason which attributes to both the effects is identical.	9.086918163752735
So , that we can get a molecular distribution; similarly , if we have ri plus viscosity then viscosity real time gives the eta value and then we can use the inverse of calibration curve to find out this molecular weight distribution.	8.91454522927806
So , how to get a highly isotactic polymers.	6.9522346052039214
So , once the polymer material has taken the shape of the container where we are doing the curing process , what happen is you cannot remelt it because they are cross linked.	9.505083065971183
This is your mole fraction.	7.0736351254531264
What you have done is initially you have taken a hydrophilic monomer and the enzyme solution in a buffer , in an aqueous buffer , mixed it into an organic solvent.	9.804744476430198
As i mentioned to you that i have seen myself the analysis in atleast one of the hospitals in sweden almost about thousand samples in a day done by an auto analyzer using immobilized enzyme and which would have required at least ten persons and you are aware that the hiring of the person is the last thing , at least in the western world.	10.38489316795349
The kind of system we will take for simplicity will be a two enzyme substrate complex formation es going to et going to e plus p.	9.963133443967967
So , this is a highly branched polymer and mostly , ldpl is low density polyethylenes are produced in this case and because this is the branched structure , it is low crystalline because the polymers cannot align each other parallely.	10.479567372251871
What is the t g for invisible blend , if you mix; say component one and component two , and then mix with each other or you make a block co polymer of one and two , which becomes invisible , then what is the t g.	10.759086391874787
You can do it in a disperse dispersed resulting polymer the produced polymer could be dispersed in organic solvent and you can continue the polymerization as the polymers remain in disperse.	10.320639257899398
We have talked about general features of anionic polymerization.	5.3093625792218795
We have also seen the fractional conversion and productivity.	7.639216283461205
So , obviously , the polymer chain or in butane will have in this case n - butane will more likely to be somewhere here , which will have higher distance between c 1, and c 4 ends.	10.392666253254994
And here it is , it is the additional factor that , you have a group.	11.570913973767706
Another factor of stereospecificity is that prediction of stereospecificity by any ground rule is difficult.	9.484932778631471
So , what is the outcome that molecular build up is much easier , because the as soon as the monomers defuse from the bulk to interface it reacts with the chain end and the chain grows one after one.	8.24059221567219
Now , what are the different stages of polymers and then how the polymers are transformed from one stage to another and ultimately where how the polymer industry works and then we talked about finally about what are the important research areas in currently researcher focusing in polymer chemistry.	8.678906885344139
In a destructive way you can also break the peptide bond but then you will be destroying the protein itself.	11.057549872092277
So , finally , this becomes the raft agent concentration.	7.321298775881544
Adsorption takes place without any hesitation.	16.48168701285661
On the left hand side the profile c indicates a ph shift to the acidic side when the enzyme is immobilized on polyorthanine which is a positively charged matrix.	8.965871379688071
So , you have binodal points here and you have spinodal points here , like that you plot t 3, and t 4, and t 5, and t 6 and so on.	7.737964287340901
That for self catalyzed reaction x n bar is 1 plus 2 n square k t , where n 0 is the concentration of the monomeric species at beginning , whereas for external catalyzed reaction , we got x n is 1 plus n 0 k dash t.	9.646023760555263
Take poly a , which is homopolymer , and mix poly b , which is another homopolymer.	15.46436191624553
You cannot account for any loss of protein in the system.	7.602068092280697
Now we can also have other types of examples; for example we know polyamide.	9.976951666699751
Why does it happen.	12.309724877351503
Today we shall consider various reactor configurations for carrying out enzyme catalyzed reactions you will appreciate from the previous discussion that among the various applications of enzymes and particularly the immobilized enzyme , their utilization for carrying out various chemical transformations is perhaps one of the most important sectors of industrial processing.	10.584716791183123
We know that in case of thermal polymerization r p is given by k p m f k d i k t half.	7.901683603539702
So , you can add those and this is molar volume so you can also write this as density and molecular width , f can be on f value of f so given by a small an hoy and this looks at one example we take p m m a poly method calculate the structure of which is as you know this is the structure.	10.367633087723437
We just need to discuss that this techniques are quite good , but this light scattering techniques or the equipments are very costly.	10.378912252574334
Okay , coming to the more definitions relevant to our course of polymer chemistry as such.	10.948427734272743
A single chain is not functionally active.	11.779187258622787
We were talking about other methods of chain initiation radical generation , and we started a discussion on redox initiator.	9.617943435894714
If you make a double reciprocal lineweaver - burk plot between one upon substrate concentration verses one upon reaction velocity , 1 / s vs 1 / v , at different inhibitor concentrations , you will notice that with increasing inhibitor concentration the value of km will undergo change.	9.712428974491939
Now , if i consider this then how this rate will look like.	6.115685929328471
Galactose and glucose are assimilable or the monosaccharides which can be assimilated and without loosing any of the nutritive value the milk can be made free from lactose and are available for consumption in some of the countries.	12.503505961170838
So , what is the experiment is done , oxygen and nitrogen are mixed , and basically starts with pure nitrogen , and oxygen is increased slowly , to find out that the minimum oxygen required in terms of volume percentage in this mixture , to sustain this flame for a specified time said for three minutes.	9.69125930551935
Only difference you must notice is vm term will correspond to vm = 2k2. e0 rather than es.	10.046982044985395
It also serves as a link between experimentally observed data and the possible reaction sequence steps.	9.899489276197704
I must mark here particularly the phrase specifically functionalized for covalent coupling.	8.338820383080906
So the cell membrane should be able to transport the substrate and the product across the boundary otherwise you cannot make the reaction feasible.	8.753056656386
You know the range of km and vm values not the absolute value and you also know the limitations of your experimental methods that you are following.	9.257947938739802
And the nature of polymer crystalline in the semi crystal material depends on how fast your cooling , what is the condition of you that the crystallization generalization.	10.606658946928247
So , if you consider this as a one bond then the other bond , you can place anywhere without having any restriction of bond angle or the rotational restriction between them.	8.26316218164623
Now , as i said that it is not possible always to take out the entire amount of condensate through the system.	6.361423783985194
More than one enzyme reactions is involved usually with a co factor regeneration that means a metabolic path way is involved with a metabolite to be produced or else if a single enzyme is desirable then it is always desirable to use non - viable cells.	10.053774234121919
And if there is less detoriation in the values of those property , then the polymer will be resistant to chemical , so this is as simply.	10.268206985425804
So that also gives us a clue about the enzymes which are more expensive.	9.752632934290304
Because , there is no distinct no boundary between , you know in this case chain we have monomers and high molecular polymers , there is nothing intermediate.	12.994898776335578
When ? l magnitude is greater than two you can safely take that the reaction is diffusional limited and kappm equal to kappm = km.	9.922966773761795
This gradient it might so happen that it comes down to zero.	7.907352759470024
And it can participate in the chain transfer reaction and giving away new catalyst , cocatalyst complex , which again can reinitiate a cationic chain polymerization.	8.562327325391754
If you have mixture of two networks , then this network will penetrate with each other and then , we call this as interpenetrating network.	8.828885542810363
It is not adsorbed; some adhering along with the liquid and so fresh wash of the buffer at a particular ph should be given so that all the adhering enzyme is washed out and only that which is physically bound by adsorption is retained by the carrier.	9.712355293980437
Because the binding site will bind two of the functional group , the third functional group which has to undergo reaction will be only recognized by the catalytic site and no other functional group will be recognized and so reaction cannot take place.	9.113985156210607
This ketone loop complex form complex with this ionic species and then once they form complex , the reactivity of this ionic species are lost.	9.444895079501958
And olefin industrial polymers was synthesized by this catalyst combination , zeigler - natta catalyst , till the discovery of metallocene catalyzed coordination polymerization.	9.844750297072125
Cellulosic materials are insoluble and the enzyme has to be reacted with this insoluble substrate to hydrolyze into glucose.	12.452518834410027
The resulting highly reacting enzyme substrate complex is then attacked by water in the normal cases if it is a hydrolytic reaction.	11.144826608050693
And that is robbery here , leathery state and on further reading , it reaches the viscosity comes down and polymer chains can move fast each other quite easily and that state is robbery.	10.273980862395122
In many cases the immobilization process might involve the reduction in the access of the substrate molecule to the enzyme active site.	7.393926180549013
The repeat unit we talked about that means if you write a polymer structure and the bracket you have put n that means you have to find the the portion thus unit which is repeating.	11.839536524462499
But fraction of collisions which can work on the activation minutes will give you a pester.	11.9108359972054
In the second case you assume that it is the protonated form which is catalytically acceptable to the enzyme function.	9.297621733582307
And , these are the one example of the hydrolysis happening during the processing condition at higher temperature , at higher shear rate.	9.222986490245269
Condensation reaction means a reaction between two molecules and subsequent elimination of small molecules.	9.794577102575534
So , heat dispersion heat dissipation is easy , viscosity is does not build up its not a problem.	8.825069327402469
There is another case where polymer is made from two different monomers , but in this case we do not call this as a copolymers , because the constituents monomer usually cannot be homo polymerized independently by the same process.	8.83196447964278
Then you can determine the viscosity average molecule rate of the unknown sample which k and a is not known in the literature.	10.2406196759926
Now , what will happen this 6 moles of , there are 6 moles of chains before termination before termination or otherwise 6 moles of kinetic chains.	8.795979117476922
So , for example , here the effect of this chlorine and methyl group on the rotation , basically if the steric effect caused by this two or more similar.	10.100010058131033
And of course , like a the homopolymerization we have discussed the reactivity of a ionic polymerization , which will depend up on the initiator you are choosing and the medium polarity solvent polarity and the temperature.	8.845927992164269
Now if this is a 1, 2 addition , then we will get a polymer like this.	8.857114256025248
So , if i can write this is ddddd or say rrrr , whatever way you write , then this will be the dl dl dl or rs rs rs type of configuration.	8.844777913097982
This is a dormant form.	7.28582714196975
Till now what we have done.	10.170022244013945
This is a dielectric , resulting dilating constant and this is your kp liter mole inverse second inverse.	9.166612248083496
From either way under equilibrium conditions , it is possible to arrive at this complex and if you consider the two routes then your ks.	11.828293804200307
This is i and which then react with a monomer forming the chain initiating spices.	9.786806362520748
So , if you do a co - polymerization starting for a composition monomer composition here , then the corresponding copolymerization will be termed as azeotropic co - polymerization.	8.316699015870611
If you remember that discussion we had just few few minutes.	8.343260056981425
We talk more about polymer crystallinity.	8.994995506623821
One is that there is some kind of a non - mixing or part of the stream which is being fed here , q is going unmixed.	9.775372577863966
That means z is the height of the length of the packed bed required to transfer the substrate concentration across the film as a function of renault number and semite number purely on the basis of mass transfer control; no biochemical reaction is assumed here.	9.849720310120937
Second substrate could be even water and thereby they will break down.	10.782147820034266
If they are different , then the most react in a more reactive group would react faster forming a block , then the second monomer would react forming a another block.	10.894234951194917
Another important feature is that the product needs to be separated to drive the coupled reaction and the separation of product is mediated by use of membrane reactor in which the high molecular weight enzyme as well as the coenzyme , which is now made to be high molecular weight , is retained in the reactor and thereby the product can be separated from the reaction mixture and the reaction can be driven in the desired direction.	10.66766838726775
Are you clear.	19.036265098444105
I will begin with classification of polymers.	6.6906413922661745
H / rt.	13.42345863897373
We have been discussing steady state analysis of mass transfer and biochemical reaction in immobilized enzyme reactors.	5.472378593495603
So basically the whole range of each of the class here oxidoreductases a bulk of the oxidases , reductases and the hydrolases fall under this category.	9.581692869034136
Another covalent bond , disulphide bonds which have an importance in the case of stability of these conformation are the oxidation of cystein residues.	11.077989141905753
If there is acidic ph , for example , ph 2, then acrylic acid remain as coh and if it is a basic ph like ph 9, then we have a coo minus group.	10.103110258045236
In the top figure different shapes indicate different amino acids and the linear chain of that is termed as primary structure.	9.428102086282474
As you increase r , if you go close to tri - symmetric , you will increase the molecular weight.	9.322391008558345
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistr y.	4.461032373395555
So that brings in a distinction between the two parameters that we are talking about.	8.136702915728087
Now , what we trying here is to find out if there is , to define the size of polymers , which will have more solubility for a given solvent or if there are , if it is not a solvent , it is two polymers or two different size molecules , then how the entropy of mixing varies with the size of the molecules.	10.213089740544413
Different inhibitor molecules bind differently to the enzyme molecule or enzyme substrate complex such that the catalytic properties are altered and thereby the rate of reaction is altered.	11.946946497463948
These polymers after synthesized are added in some formulations along with the other components like in detergent , paint , ink , emulsions; where polymers are added with some other compounds.	10.994681508231213
Again , this is a case of reversible termination like atip.	9.794770103041254
So , in comparison to cationic polymerization and anionic polymerization , anionic polymerization , anionic chain ends are much more stable compared to a cationic chain end.	9.529775992576418
If i go from a ring size to 3 to 4, strain comes down.	7.754503029450673
Therefore it could be either by change of solvent , it could be change of by certain ions , it could be by temperature; the usual parameters which can induce insolubility or it can affect the solubility of the polymer.	9.808840774743064
So , that it becomes complicated.	7.800520224443443
So on mixing , the only change in the entropy would be the combinatorial entropy and what is the combinatorial entropy or configurational entropy is the number of ways you can arrange a different molecules.	9.544367052624656
That is the basic backbone of the peptide bond.	7.1194078092899895
One is that the e can synthesized in this route that is your k - 1, k - 2 and k.	9.358206233028136
Now , let us first understand , why we need to add additives in polymers.	7.425216643998866
So , reactivities of those functional is not very high and it is it is a equilibrium process , and and during the reaction you have to make sure that your equilibrium goes towards right by taking out the bi product formation from the system.	10.0802158641954
So , that is the number of functional group present at t is equal to .	4.497935277665041
Anything like diffusional limitations , partitioning effects and non - ideal fluid flow behaviour which we will consider subsequently one by one to arrive at the final reactor performance.	10.903962323809191
L . l is the characteristic dimension of the immobilized particle.	10.913099727271355
When more polymer forms , rate of polymers increases , and because the radical concentration increases , increased with temperature , the termination reaction also increase.	11.08861759005023
So , if the value of k and a changes , and that will change for a different polymer even if we keep the solvent same and temperature same; if we change the polymers the value of k and a will change; value of k and hence the intrinsic viscosity will change.	8.94588492478998
Now , let us say have so this will say talk about now a 4 member ether , now in this case there is a nucleophilic atom of the oxygen to the proton and you get , you actually form secondary oxonium ion , in all this cases you have a counter end associated with that you this will react with another monomer and propagate in the chain.	9.566499047202173
Now , how this will react.	7.390448872995308
In the continuous stirred tank reactor one is a continuous flow reactor.	7.3118609126034935
And the deformation is basically a but , what we discussed , what we talked about mechanical properties.	12.251773114886372
Now , this is any , just this is not .	9.957913365110766
So , the values of reflective index , if it is right , then say pet , we will have a value of 1.64, pc equal 1.594 pmma 1.49, and say ptfe will have even lower reflective index.	10.02582949194176
For such simple system writing by observation will look to be more difficult than solving the steady state equation but if you have let us say more than one enzyme substrate complex it may look to be simpler to write by observation.	12.541149316272838
That means , for most of the polymerization , step polymerization , when you are making high enough molecular weight as we know by this time , that p should be very close to 1, that means , for any given high molecular weight step polymer the polydispersity is expected to be very close to .	10.093330017546448
Now , i have made t del s to compare and put it in the same scale this is from cyclo alkane liquid cyclo alkane to linear crystalline polymers.	9.230655226194644
Last time i was taking we had also considered certain idealized reactor design parameter.	10.853619331840557
Now , next example of polyurethane.	9.720472955074152
So that is your sample s , and you have reference , which is empty.	11.600153865202918
Therefore the ph effects must be looked into all these parameters or all these effects in a comprehensive manner.	9.908727080805704
That means the distance of transport of the substrate into the immobilized enzyme particle is minimized or reduced.	8.12416784217927
But the k a . kb term is missing which implies in the case of pong ping pong reaction mechanism , the term k a is zero and that makes a very big point to discriminate between the different reaction mechanisms.	9.06819287803701
In fact many of the enzyme preparations then could be stored in the presence of substrate and that was another conclusion or observation he gave way back in 189.	11.169284297434308
Now , what is the rate of termination.	6.624873086604631
So , once again at present , you should classify condensation polymers.	8.610958073022209
You notice the relationship between the apparent km for a and k a.	9.29014983998061
That provides us a simple tool , batch reactor for small scale laboratory experiments to determine the kinetic parameters both for soluble enzyme as well as for immobilized enzyme.	9.324121286137249
So , we can write for monomer , we can write rate of transfer monomer given by , k transfer monomer m dot m.	8.188367864155571
So , if you just look at this curve one more time , the melting is a first order transition , where g varies with temperature , the x - axis is the temperature , with g varies continuously with temperature and the first derivative of g , v , h , s , they varies discontinuously.	8.677013062408621
Now , we have talked about different types of copolymers , random copolymers , copolymers , alternate copolymers , block copolymers.	6.435651087387422
So , if you want to have a application practical application of utility of polypropylene molecules , then you should have a regular structures like isotactic or some cases in that atactic also able to crystallize but probably in a lesser extent compared to a isotactic polypropylene.	9.226605014637565
Crystalinity polymer as you know as we discussed many times in this course; that polymer are hardly crystallize up to hundred percent , so most cases if they , the crystality varies from zero hundred polymers , so polymer are generally semi crystalline in nature.	10.513402322261912
So , in more technical sense , it is called a semi - crystalline polymer.	8.696653972942773
So , the more and more active centers , more and more initiator gets generated in a system , more and more chain form , so if i plot conversation , say percentage conversation means the fraction of monomers is reacted or this appeared from the reaction medium with the molecular weight or the size of the chain or a size.	9.45406429494547
Under those conditions it must remain adsorbed and so the final washing in the case of a reactor loading method is provided by the feed substrate itself so that whatever desorption has to take place under feed substrate condition , takes place and the enzyme is in the stable form.	9.843180703100535
So , we are talking about molar mass in this case , total weight you have , if you have i number of molecules you can sum with i and you can sum in the vision.	10.659902170708104
They all take place through a series of chemical reactions.	9.064956306509393
This is the s case for the mixture.	7.734751725857663
When i say per ml i am referring to a parameter which is analogues to use in a packed bed.	7.874081276851633
So , x n will vary with the time.	7.203910000993997
As a result they can crystallize easily and hence the melting point is higher 74 degree centigrade compared to 28 degree c.	9.766574536459549
Now , remember this is i am just following the simple reaction these tetramer can react with dimer , monomer and trimer further reducing the chains.	9.132043171274146
You can also do isothermal t g where weight loss is monitor , with time and constant temperature.	9.102507207826614
Another important significance of the michaelis menten kinetics is its application to assay of the enzymes.	8.620164660070014
The enzyme substrate complex must not be confused with a part in the transition state complex.	8.519012936571857
But if we compare , like compare n - propyl substitution with isopropyl substitution , then the t g goes up little bit; 38 to 50 degree centigrade.	7.964417431010097
So , the functional , the reactivity of more the functional group is independent of the other functional group irrespective of the length in between , which makes this , all the reaction as happens in the step growth polymers , polymerization process , they are same.	9.475339586199384
So , with this i conclude this module on step growth polymers and polymers and polymerization step growth polymerization mechanism.	7.825763160470965
Exactly we will know that , degree average number average degrees of polymerization is equals to b nu , where b is the number of initiator residue average number of initiator residue per polymer chain.	9.022198482790715
To summarize the results of the michaelis menten kinetics and briggs and haldane kinetics , we have two kinetic parameters which can characterize any enzyme catalyzed reactions.	9.68472300073322
If we consider s0 as the concentration term so that it becomes per unit volume also.	9.889937864436554
For immobilized cell although theoretically almost all methods , variety of methods starting from adsorption to entrapment have been used sparingly , the bulk of the methods that had been used rather . . . on industrial scale are based on adsorption or entrapment.	10.990376349409079
This is having t g of minus 120, polyethylene minus 80 and say it is a much rigid backbone; polypropylene oxide p p o , 200 degree centigrade.	9.860914668378443
Now , what do you , what i mean by later stage.	7.035754249370634
Now , this is this ranking does not hold always there are cases where there is a specific interaction or putting a affinity between monomer molecule plus solvent , there is specific affinity between this.	9.458408574091598
Similarly , in this case , the reactivity of this radical does not depend; we are assuming that it does not depend on the size of the molecules.	6.965418275668311
Where in case of del s a one molar solution , it could be either of this two , you have to pure monomer is converted into pure polymer which is either completely crystalline or slightly amorphous , del s you can also consider from pure to pure or a one molar solution of the monomer to a one molar solution of the polymer repeat unit.	10.15107356071698
The stereochemical specificity can extend to the level that enzyme acting on a non assymetric molecule can produce one of the isomers as a product.	10.397919460226808
We call a solution as ideal solution when the ingredients all the components solute and the solvent are having same size; the individual sizes , molecular sizes are same.	9.560129839867203
Now , you may ask me , what is the need for having more than one molecular weight.	8.389176009042645
You can always argue , that ok , i have all those homopolymers , now i can mix them in different proportions to get the composition of what i want , which will finally give the same composition , which you might get in the copolymers.	10.276220948492835
Anylate means that chemical species which is to be analyzed say for example you want to analyze sugar some glucose in blood; glucose is the anylate.	12.163132041936679
So , from this expression also you can predict that the polymer solvent interaction parameter will be lower than 0.5, which means the polymer will promote or it will dissolve in the solvent you are using.	8.473092916103669
So , here again you can have if you have same configuration of this carbons then this is like this.	9.134381934101498
This is this will form and get poly posphogen , if you have a cyclic cyloxin molecule it open up to give you linear poly cyle oxide.	10.539555515267496
Now , this polymerization continue till second radical gets into this reactor , because the size is very small , so if the second radical gets in the effective radical concentration goes high , so the immediately the bimolecular termination reaction happen.	9.640023916017999
Now , if the size of the solute molecule goes up and becomes sufficiently large so that radius is of the order of lambda dash by 2.	8.82750172155112
If r is greater than 0.25 and r r greater than one fourth , then it is towards a syndiotactic.	11.047510132950835
So , so a polymer which is found forms abscisic acid and hexamethylenediamine , abscisic acid and diamine acid and amine which will you have to put name as a amide.	10.064729158895966
You make a p polymer so the viscosity is not high and then that pre - polymer is poured into a mold in this case sheet.	11.698978999545261
Now vinyl acetate , obviously undergo very fissile homopolymerization , but when you have a styrene as a second monomer.	10.752086664136648
So , if you have several detector placed at different angles theta one , theta two , theta three and so on , we need to normalize the signal from this detector.	8.284989903593043
And at some temperature , this deformation happens , and that particular temperature is known as heat deflection temperature.	10.643429874550439
Then you have a fluctuation in the scattering intensity is detected by the detector.	9.45148863736766
If you have no substitution , its work fine in radical , if you have monosubstituted , it works fine , except the case where it is c h 3 propylene , will come back of why it is so.	10.995730187737824
The same process was used in japan using a soluble batch enzyme over a period of about ten years and they were producing l amino acids by using the amino acylase soluble enzyme produced from the microbial resources but in those soluble enzyme batch processes , the problem of purification was very , very severe.	10.002545663668336
For if , say one was solvent , obviously x 1 is your .	11.863057513703481
In fact you will notice that in some of the industrially used immobilized enzyme preparations the low cost carriers has been rejected mainly because of some of the undesirable properties that they cannot get you a very high enzyme loading on them and many of the expensive carriers have been used but only under the condition that they can be regenerated.	10.497793405146792
These are all carbon.	8.538028704906061
So , remember the upper limit of the measurements where about lambda dash by .	8.030627027815537
After the initial period of time , the concentration of radical are small which will ensure the termination reaction is negligible and also because these are equilibrium process , every radical is coming out and going in the dormant form.	9.936087335663842
One cannot really , for any immobilized enzyme reactor , measure the film thickness and then make a design computation.	11.076708842260203
The functional aspect of the enzymes like the kind of chemical reactions they catalyze , the thermodynamic limits , the equilibrium convergence , the free energy change , whether the reaction is feasible , the coupling of reactions so that they become feasible in terms of free energy change and all those aspects of the enzymes protein will come under realm of bio chemistry.	11.50905225589686
As in the very first reaction itself for example hexokinase will act on glucose as a substrate and produce the corresponding phosphorylated sugar.	10.031232411438467
And basically what we get when we heat the polymers.	9.640793160232915
Now , this , these are the examples where you do not have an inherent termination reaction.	6.424912204920375
So , next lecture i will complete that discussion on step polymerization.	7.4808531399145295
So , there will be drop in transparency , but it will not , may not be opaque.	9.20707846181533
I would like to give you a brief about the historical perspectives.	9.528430359773113
It does increase , and then become steady after very high molecular weight.	8.426719891090704
Obviously , the chain will expand you can you can anticipate that if the interactions between polymer solvents is favorable compared to the main interaction between solvent solvent and polymer polymer.	9.955222500571763
Commodity polymers you know the polymers which you see in a real life in all the times , the bottles , buckets , shoes , clothes and all these things , they are having much volume used heavily and so , the prices are low and performance is also not so good compared to the others classes of polymers.	11.3607745096407
So , this will react much more to with the solvent molecule in this case.	6.770422483754185
So , that is this.	4.065930098886321
So , if you have good solvent , where the polymer solvent interaction is favorable compared to a solvent solvent interaction then polymer chain will expand , if you have a poor solvent where solvent solvent you know , solvent polymer interaction are not favorable.	9.437660242413969
So , this is example of alkyl halide , which is used for this cocatalyst or initiator in this reaction.	8.333169614663458
Now what happened.	5.945605833463479
Now you will be surprised to know that so far globally about three thousand enzymes have been isolated , characterized and reported in literature.	9.365651138241263
And the other examples of copolymers which are available commercial like ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer unsaturated polysters and so on.	7.999528111030993
Once the inhibitor is present the e0 will be distributed into free enzyme , e , es , ei and esi.	9.875281493671212
In next class , also i will talk about , continue with the introduction , more talk about the , we will talk about the nomenclature.	9.672324811677182
K h have value between 0.3 for good solvent to 0.5 for poor solvent.	10.63442237645024
Suddenly at any given time t a tracer is inserted into the reactor in the feed stream by short period of time and the concentration is monitored in the exit stream.	9.589641739693185
So , if you want to compare between different polymers , the thermal stability at higher temperature you must compare , at same heating rate.	7.139938348434625
Biuret method is based on the development of a blue color with an alkaline copper sulphate solution containing sodium potassium tartrate.	11.926877046472136
Say , at low conversion that means at the beginning of the reaction low conversion x n bar is given by 1 by 1 minus p x w n given by 1 plus p 1 minus p and x w bar x n bar p d i given by 1 plus p.	8.320032423771462
Then , this follows the ability of these substituent groups to stabilize the radical generated from this monomer.	8.984109895193091
K2.e0.v . e *.	14.117753571204231
Once the enzymatic reaction is defined the nature of substrate is fixed.	10.78305624675408
Salts have a very complex behavior.	15.536178377172664
So , now , you have a water soluble species , again this is water soluble.	8.126944367900338
Now , it can be expressed , we have expressed earlier in two components , it contains two components; one is enthalpic excess and more enthalpy and one excess and more entropy.	9.343710652901581
Now so mu if we write 1 for the solvent molecule and this superscript of 0 having for pure solvent at say , original pressure p will be equal to the chemical potential of the solvent where the pressure is increased from p to p plus pi where pi is the osmotic pressure.	9.534620763051013
What could be the reason , we have found that in case of step polymerization , the polydispersity index is always two.	10.911263153720542
Even if your feed history substrate is impure to some extent you will know that only reaction which can be catalyzed specifically by that enzyme which you are providing will take place and no other reaction will take place.	10.217923668478027
They can be used over a long period of time with very high operational stability but the cost of preparation usually is much higher than all other methods.	8.244035002077853
Unless you.	11.522348888266885
The plate is placed in a source of mass spectrometer and a short pulse of high energy if this is a must sample plate , and this is your sample along with the matrix; and a short pulse of high energy laser is irradiates the target , vaporizing the matrix when a high energy lasers irradiates with the polymer sample along with the matrix gets vaporized and in the vapor phase the polymer actually desorbs from the matrix , and if the polymer is ionized already a charged polymer is fine; if it is not charged , it is a neutral polymer then we have to add some salt to cationise this polymers.	10.858204978182572
Now , let us talk about one more class of additives - anti oxidants.	5.806241931252049
When you mention vm as characteristic it refers to a particular enzyme concentration.	7.924316659962085
This is dissociation constant and kb and ka indicated here are the concentration of the substrates a and b respectively at which the reaction velocity is half the maximum reaction velocity at saturating level of the other substrate.	9.541676190149264
If there are some mities or some which absorb light , then it will absorb light , and it will decrease the intensity of the , out flask of the outgoing transmitted light , this might give you color in the medium.	9.269868281959498
The only thing what i want mention , is the examples of few conducting polymers like; polyanile , ploypyrrole and structures are given here.	9.503686449007427
Here we pass it through a heat exchanger just to maintain the temperature fifty degrees and pass through the immobilized enzyme column.	9.994674577937342
In the example i cited a little ago on the hydrolysis of penicillin to 6 - apa because of simultaneous acid production you need to control the ph otherwise the enzyme gets inactivated and a very precise control of ph is needed and therefore addition of the alkali simultaneously is a must and which can be carried out very easily in a stirred batch reactor and with a control system you can control the ph.	9.828046263754073
If there is , you can make a block copolymer or a two phase system , where the two phases same refractive index , no matter what is the size of the scatterer , it will not scatter , but if there is difference in refractive index , the higher is the size of the scatterer , it will scatter more , and it may turn opaque whereas , if the scatterer size small , it will scatter less.	10.327734975624377
This is the most common way making block copolymer , but we will not discuss this technique of synthesizing block copolymer in this section.	9.776141797045334
Even if the diffusional rate is very slow the substrate can reach to all parts of the enzyme go down to as low as possible and the ratio of the two that means the maximum reaction rate which you can get when you go down in the particle size to that of the reaction rate which is obtained by a particular particle size is defined as the effectiveness factor.	11.260584334157086
Had this reaction not been reversible totally then the term p will become zero , irreversible reaction.	11.110309092696072
Number of distinguishable ways you can arrange different molecules; the more number of such numbers , then the entropy of mixing is higher.	8.965391934994237
So , for simplicity we are just writing , omitting this subscript and writing this m plus.	8.015102714302138
But like the earlier case they cannot , this side of monomers cannot undergo , a chain polymerization initiated by a cationic species , because then if you are a cationic group here , it will not be stabilized by resonance.	10.962553511817429
We talk about of each of this brief.	10.246153642912777
These have to be multiplied by solvent mono - fraction.	11.269357930315653
The enzyme molecule aggregates and comes out in the form of a precipitate , the gelatinous mass and when they are used in the enzyme reactors , they don t offer a good flow property in the reactor and therefore they are not a very desirable kind of a material which can be processed in the enzyme reactor.	10.709000635905475
Lipase from various sources can exhibit specificity , only one of the isomer either l or d isomer.	13.937840624692214
So , polymers must have amenable end groups which can be analyzed by say titrometry or spectophotometrically and concentration must be high enough , so that we can determine the concentration of end group accurately or quantitatively , and the other group presence in the polymer should not interfere in the determination of the end groups of our interest.	10.393855753862915
The ring size determines the stability , and of course guide the tendency of your formation.	10.75807054409748
So this is the molar ratio of monomer m 1 and m 2, in the copolymer , any instance where the corresponding concentration of free monomer , in the reaction medium , given by this m 1 and this m .	9.010321609844343
The r p and x n the molecular weight can be also dependent on the pressure as well , though it is not that significant as temperature.	11.678958256957978
Now , we know again from , of , it gives you phi i a k t to the power half.	6.107149755434681
In the mixture , we have 2 chains or 2 moles of chains , x n bar with nu and 2 moles of chains with x n bar of 2 nu.	9.130215610524568
You can make low density polyethylene as well by copolymerizing with slight amount of one olefin , such as one butylene or one hexylene along very slight amount with ethylene that , we will basically introduce to do branches and reduce the crystallization , increase reduce the density as well.	9.738411855226797
This is only one of probably a large number of relationships that are reported in the literature of heterogeneous catalysis in chemical engineering.	10.033648168943236
E * which was equal to 5.7kcal / mole.	10.215510668372955
So , this are the term sometime used; engineering stress is f force by original a , and true stress is changing , is actually basically the force by the area at given time , by similarly engineering strain is given by dl by this original length.	9.968584164199795
So , the k 5, k 6 and k 4 are very small; k 6, value of k 6 and k 4 are insignificant; we can ignore them , because in most practical scenario , we take out this 2 from the system to make reaction move towards right hand side.	8.018391207186033
H * / rt ) the final conclusion is that for a catalyst or an enzyme in our case as we are talking about to be able to include the value of k2, it must be able to reduce the energy of activation or increases the k * value that is equilibrium constant.	9.38980716802728
As i said we will use this expression mark - houwink expression when we try to determine the molecular weight; we will discuss the determination of molecular weight of polymer chain by viscosity method.	9.518837538250462
So , the curve deviates from linearity at high concentration.	7.469111784039301
So , increasing the solvent concentration , which is taking part in the chain transfer reaction or increasing the monomer concentration or similar , similar thing , we can describe exactly like the chain transfer reactions for radical polymerization.	10.300940796575846
And auto acceleration , because it is a bulk polymerization auto acceleration will also happen , but that is not , in this case this is not that much problematic like the case of pure bulk polymerization.	11.125033918340321
And i also did not i could not include several others.	10.518396434604007
Now , what are the typical values of this e d and e t.	6.457157605127813
You see that when you increase the substrate concentration the weightage to 1 / s concentration is so low that ultimately you end up in a scattering , a cluster of data near the origin and therefore getting the realistic value of km and vm often tends to be difficult even after making a statistical analysis.	9.831754947075792
So , if you if you think about the gibbs energy of mixing which is delta h minus 3 delta s.	6.932847975632145
In the case of bisubstrate reactions we have much more possibilities , much more types of mechanistic approaches that are feasible and they are taken into account.	9.338535351501871
So on storage the concentration of this dimer increases.	10.891784293414974
Now , this configuration , we can put in two types configuration sawhorse projection , and newman projection , and then in this case , this 1 methyl group and 4 methyl group is trans to each other.	9.240090263445998
How do you induce crystalinity in a polymer material.	7.058892494587416
It will stop here same as if your p is low.	8.157498445270475
This is for a a and this is for b b , this is for a a.	8.433556310885395
So , what happen that the radical will go in small number of micelles which will grow , and form particles surrounded by the surfactant.	8.864087747914262
So , if you put further substitution , reaction do not contribute much in the terms of a restriction in bond rotation.	7.785477035849004
So , in a steady state , the rate of initiation is equals to rate of termination.	8.197934609754972
Look at the cost part because it is process economics and this was the data presented by the authors themselves who carried out the commercial operation and if you compare the production cost of l - amino acids by batch which was being operated originally that means prior to 1963 it was a batch soluble enzyme process and a continuous immobilized enzyme process.	10.212871452114316
This is a mixture of dextrins , a small chain length starch molecules; chain length not more than ten , usually six to eight but the dextrins should not have more than ten glucose units linked together and this is the step which is the rate limiting step in the whole process , the dextrins to glucose by amyloglucosidase or glucoamylase; it is called as glucoamylase also.	10.09624433020619
So , basically in this case , low molecular weight chain are not present in that amount and that number if there was no this multifunctional poly - functional group.	7.617358509419483
That means three or four or more enzyme molecules aggregate together through a covalent linkage mediated by a cross linking agent which is usually a multi - functional reagent and therefore the enzyme molecules form an aggregate that are insoluble in water.	9.41031427029635
If you look at the basic definition or a very broad operational definition of biotechnology it deals with the application of scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and services.	9.398381220338141
So , it will not react.	6.027801231428374
Compare another set of polymer polystyrene four poly four vinyl chlorobenzene , the values for the t g are given by 100 degree centigrade , 110 and 14.	13.244145237823046
So the value of the effectiveness factor can be theoretically calculated and also the k , the overall reaction rate constant which takes into account the biochemical reaction and combined film and pore diffusional effects.	8.361946105635033
So , look here because now this , when you have this isobutyl and tertiary butyl group , they are becoming bulky in this way and whereas n - propyl groups , they are becoming bulk or increasing size.	10.422394837890502
In this lecture thirteen , we plan to cover effect of temperature on rate of polymerization and molecular weight , and also we will start our discussion on thermodynamics of chain growth polymerization.	7.535342865834027
This is true for almost every possible ring.	9.036737932317598
There are other chemical treatments but the last resort is to put on a dialysis system.	9.240769804790947
Why should we care at all.	14.264547254454524
In the first characteristic feature of catalysis we saw that the transition state is complementary to enzyme substrate complex and not the substrate.	8.39716708589836
So , n b is n a by r 1 over .	7.079371042093099
So , what is finally , k comes p.	6.71138332639703
Next set of polymers we go is polysulfones and polyketones the generic structure is this its similar to the bisphenol astructure is polycarbonate x is , but in this case x is allied instead of h and y is either a carbonyl or so 2 group.	10.066787835772715
Now we will move and briefly discussed , how we determine , or measure t g and t m in laboratory.	8.368495469536576
On the other hand the effect of product inhibition is more serious particularly when high conversions are required.	7.392980468771299
So both the unfolding of the protein molecule on the surface of the carrier and the diffusional processes involved in the adsorption in the internal pores ultimately leads to give you a phenomenon which represents increase in adsorption with increase in temperature over a narrow range.	9.502474677234943
These are the disadvantage for a solution polymerization , but still use for making polyethylene poly acrylonitrile or polyethylene acetate.	9.666662980886365
Now , as we all know that ir spectroscopy are mainly used in functional group determination , and it is basically , a transition between in different fiber , vibration states of a molecules.	8.648320441224538
So , these are the basic auto oxidation mechanism by which oxidative degradation might happen.	7.196107868610403
See , in this call characteristic ratio , so the higher this value you will the polymer chain you would expect would be much more stiffer , let us compare few numbers , numbers for this steric factor , and characteristic ratio for polymers at different temperature.	10.823246215355
So , the critical concentration at which the phase separation first appears going from a two phase region , from one phase region in to two phase region is thus predicted to occur at low polymer concentration , if we have say polymer having a polymer weight of 1 million 10 to the power 6 gram per mole , and then if you have the repeating this molecule to this is hundred , this is the molecular weight , then x would be close to 10 to the power 4 close to ten to the power 4, then phi 2 c would be 0.0.	10.081786096224294
First this is the reaction scheme this is the monomer tertiary , and it was reacted with this , it is underground radical polymerization by aibn in range of heat , in presence of this gel transformation , and you have this first or first block.	12.604498587234263
So , basically that will give us some idea , if we keep that polymer material at that particular temperature for long time , as especially in elevated temperature , where there is some degradation or decomposing happening or not.	9.491496403557347
So , basically styrene have much higher tendency to homo polymerize compared to copolymerized with vinyl acetate , where as vinyl acetate has very little tendency to homo polymerize.	8.629792359710033
One must look at the deactivation effect , the third effect and the second effect that is on the k2 as opposite forces.	12.172387579499993
If you have more stiffer group , then the t g t m sorry t m goes up even higher.	8.324710234673871
There are many others which can be in list , but these are some of the examples , some of the physical properties , undergo change their value during glass transition , and melting.	9.923526164070394
The most commonly employed cross linking reagent over the years has been glutaraldehyde.	9.515039806575267
So far we have been limited in our mind regarding the application of enzymes that they can work only in aqueous environment.	8.84308494011012
But you will notice that at least the first three parameters are very commonly used parameters for even isolation of an enzyme sample from a crude protein sample.	9.59754772728846
If they are not unimolecular then rates will be different.	7.570402802207364
The expression in the parenthesis is same and you remember we have defined right at the beginning that the reactor performance can be simplified by taking a reaction rate expression which is multiplied by effectiveness factor.	9.920203068751771
If in this case for pvc , there is a significant amount of materials remaining , even after complete bonding.	10.933320464111201
So you have now the relative concentrations or the relative fractions of each of the enzyme species that are present.	7.559165711283451
The enzyme can be immobilized but alternatively in the general fashion it can also be in the form of soluble enzyme.	8.507497526981258
So , if you go back and look at this expression and just plot c is equal to 0 lines and theta equals to 0 line , and see what are the information we can get.	6.6002380843953805
This is very useful method for low molecular weight samples because if we go for high molecular weight then the increase in the temperature is very low.	8.675106889961825
Then the final product from the packed bed column goes to a concentrator where it is concentrated just to take advantage of solubility and crystallization and the l - amino acid gets crystallized and the crystalline l - amino acid is separated.	9.791345822594716
So we have only two groups with net positive charge.	9.34153162175883
And if we can carry out this reaction at low temperature , what happen.	8.758551677545151
The kinetics is basically developed on single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions.	7.583078725407364
However if we use immobilized enzyme preparation , the separation of the enzyme is feasible by filtration or centrifugation and you can reuse it.	12.22343536809263
And also , one single chain can be part of different crystalline regions.	9.101399248892516
These are theoretical situations which are comparatively simpler.	9.595514557932939
Now , that is because that that because the polymers are long chain and you have there is a numerous possible confirmations , because you have a rotational freedom across the backbone and if the polymer chain rotates across the backbone , obviously you will get different chains different confirmations and the backbones are quite flexible in case of polymers.	10.814765291861454
Not that on the terminal side if they are far away from active site they will play a role.	11.135462183921506
So , we must know the behavior of the polymers in solutions to understand how we can utilize these synthesize polymers in those applications.	7.749145192319996
One of the most important features is to test the validity of steady state assumption.	7.437019674775046
M v is given by as a is between 0.5 to 0.8 m v would lie m n and m w and it will be much more closer towards m w if a is higher; if the coil expand , it will be more expansion more closer to m w and for highly stiff rods where a is 1, m v becomes equals to m w.	10.276168573297666
They are used , they can be used because this counter ions are not so strong nucleophile like halide ions , but still this , this , because they are , they are also significantly nucleophilic , this cannot built very high molecular with polymers by cationic chain polymerization.	10.36237308932799
This is the reaction scheme for a polyestrification process.	7.537293089050382
Now , as we have seen that if the delta value of the polymer is closer to the value of solvent that of solvent liquid that of mixing the polymer will be soluble in that solvent.	9.394967170416058
Km and vm is the slope at i = 0 which is already known to us and therefore the magnitude of ki can be easily determined.	12.52516871567679
And i have given few example during my lectures you should be able to calculate the m n there the number average molecular weight from x n the degree number average degrees of polymers.	8.40905437410775
Another very important industrial reactor which has been used is a spiral wound , multipore , biocatalytic module.	9.680241516378883
We are taking out the condensate small molecules h 2 o in this case to make sure that the reaction happened.	10.847876814449394
In the case of analysis of the internal pore diffusion in the case of an immobilized enzyme reactor , the analysis amounts to determination of effectiveness factor for a particular system and that is directly controlled by the value of effective diffusivity , the reaction rate constant and the size of particles what we are considering.	9.881510942652406
See in these cases say , 90 percentage or something and you also know pbi which is close to .	9.811551559373822
If you change the temperature of your polymer solvent mixture , they are , they will change.	9.052906394675878
They have some better properties , but in a cost of something else.	10.693355411448229
Where you can stop the reaction in between and find out the functional group , in case of step polymerization by in case of these is the conservation monomer molecule , so from this you can get the value of r p.	9.554393982069074
Obviously , it depends on the chemical structures; for example , if hydrolysable groups.	8.996724723746446
This is the proportional to the limit and this is the point where , yield happened yield means , sneaking happens in the sample.	8.920516696148301
So , slopes for these two straight line will give other information.	9.553805060978878
If you talk about the case , we just talked about say r 1 less than 1 and r 2 is also less than 1, what will happen.	6.9589479515166115
In all these methods which we are talking about , the final step is washing because very often you will have that some of the enzyme will be adhering to the surface of the particles which is not really immobilized in the proper sense.	10.066397337182213
We will go into functional nature of enzymes , enzymes as the catalyst and what makes them such an efficient catalyst.	9.635013386874883
Some terms related to tensile testing , stiffness usually stiffness related to the product of the modulus and the movement of inertia.	11.30154092202551
So , m m n number of average molecular rate is nothing but the simple arithmetic , it is the simple arithmetic mean , average of your sample.	9.919810102526437
You have studied for last 5 - 6 lectures , what is radical polymerization , radical chain polymerization and have talked about different monomer structures , but finally , it matters or it is useful if some commercial polymers have made using these techniques.	10.562318926236411
What is the structure microstructure of the polymer , and also most important is what is the molecular weight of the polymers which we made , and what are the as you know that polymers seldom have unique; all the polymers chains have same molecular weight.	8.882552111475547
Because during the polymer processing , when you take this polymer and process mix with something compound and then take that compound at granules to make some final product by say , molding process , being low molecular weight this cyclic molecules tend to come up to the surface.	9.951974661091938
For example , they can reduce the or they can absorb the heat release during the combustion process , by releasing water from them.	9.66376706030731
So , this is what you found , freely rotated , freely jointed chain there is no restriction we got rms end - to - end distance for free chain , if as a subscript it is meaning is that it is a free rotating chain , it is given by this expression and when you have bond angle restriction , we get this expression.	8.538580958406124
As i said , that bimolecular termination is not possible , bimolecular termination by the action of two propagating species is not possible and so if you can suppress the other , other reactions , which are chain transfer reaction , if you can suppress those , you can actually keep this chains , this ionic chains as living because you can , because the inherent or intrinsic termination reaction between the propagating species are not there , they are absent.	11.270205951447846
Now , this is interesting in terms of how we apply nmr spectroscopy for polymer science , the discussion about , last few minutes about nmr spectroscopy is about general , which applied to any organic chemistry or any other science nmr , any other course.	10.06441002867674
This expression or scattering equations varied for very dilute solution , we ideally want the scattering intensity from one molecule.	9.651495892426265
Not that there is no charge.	11.537236566263822
L will be small and therefore also there will be no diffusion control.	8.1525622156825
They are brought in proximity by folding of the enzyme protein.	7.336379002587011
So these are all h , v h expansion factor h.	9.102535713125867
When you talk of hydrolysis being used in the reverse direction for synthetic purposes water will be produced and this water needs to be essentially removed.	9.749315527223576
This equation later we will use for determining molecular weight by dilute solution viscometry so , please remember this expression where k is constant and a is also constant.	9.610025284768524
So for this restriction , you will have increase in the root mean square end to end distance.	6.6885972228028825
When the estimation of activation energy was made under different substrate concentration regimes and with immobilized particles , one noticed a profile something like a biphasic profile.	10.182082348144778
You can have stereoisomers or which you call in polymer term , different tacticity.	9.55086772869208
So , if the situation is like this , then you are going to get a polymer like this , which is essentially a homo polymer because it is mostly m 1 with sometime m 2 here and there entering in the copolymer.	8.952190598427876
So , these values also will change.	6.151753696651336
This term is k akb.	12.239526797587406
So , if you are talking about a polar solvent , then small counter ion , counter cation will help in separating those ion - pairs and hence the reaction will be to go up and in the case of non - polar solvent where the ions , the anion , carbanion and the counter ion are tight , then it is , if it is the size is higher , the , the ions are little loose , so the reactions is higher.	9.204237199152509
Bf 3 plus h 2 o makes a complex or we can use other lewis acids and we can use this alkyl halides as a cocatalyst and this case , the complex found is like this.	10.642944178810083
Now we can get the same polyester by ring - opening polymerization of cyclic lactones.	8.888105373097648
So , i can write x 2 delta mu 1 plus x 2 delta mu .	7.4955407412023956
You identify the , you already identified the repeating unit and how do how do i name the repeat unit.	12.058176542275682
Take a typical example of alcohol dehydrogenase.	10.528747325640488
So , obviously , the rate at which m 1 and m 2 getting incorporated in a co polymer chain , are same as their ratio in the monomer field.	8.187930215221304
On the other hand the stabilization of the transition state of the chemical reaction which is the desired reaction which you want to catalyze.	9.363501967243797
So , to avoid confusion sometimes it is written at small r lower case r and sometimes this is written as s.	8.359257743897055
We talked about the koshland s induced fit hypothesis whereby when the substrate molecule binds to one of the binding sites the enzyme undergo a conformational change so as to fit on to the substrate molecule.	8.779373822608125
That means reaction almost becomes diffusion control.	8.130154580796658
So , basically though in true sense it is a stereo center and a chiral molecule but because these are long molecules and first few molecules are same , they basically do not show any optical activity.	9.25904457290229
The fraction f2 of the total volume of the reactor is represented as a dead zone.	8.25428734180416
In the first slide we saw that some of the enzymes which are of industrial value are very specific.	9.264519535886345
And for all analytical purposes , the substrate concentration that is taken is much , much larger than enzyme concentration.	7.065117584489858
So , in this case number of repeating units ru repeating units is same as number of structural units su is structural units.	6.641616073247302
For example in this case since all the steps are reversible there will be three patterns.	11.568926412313274
Now , this term twice is introduced; in some text , this twice is introduced , because that the 1 termination reaction is effective in bringing the termination of 2 radical.	8.858948225065824
What you are getting is the polymer chains are forming in steps , dimer , trimer and tetramer and because these monomers can react this function group , so they will react immediately.	10.28767405098609
So , what is the number of functional group.	4.8012931908673195
So , if you increase the length of the column the resolution goes up.	5.106059670734271
We will also talk briefly , that most often polymer are not used as such , they are basically used with other radiatives , which basically protect some of the , this polymers , this external agent we talk about , or this enhances the property , which can be used from outside.	11.390112102771942
Handling of the additives also concerned.	14.607583458922274
Now as we understand in last lecture that most of the chain most of the polymer chains are flexible , and when they are dissolved in solution and they are moved in solution , they actually carry the solvent molecules which are attached to the polymer coil; they move along with the polymer coil.	10.855619730861381
We will discuss this , effect of this little detailed with examples.	8.641731393679235
When this stable free radical polymerization is done through nitroxide , it is often called nm p nitroxide mediated polymerization.	10.751207026644495
So , reactivity actually comes down very much.	8.595621859972539
No . the comparison will be only when we take the same reaction and in reactor performance equation in addition to internal pore diffusion you also consider partitioning effects.	11.179060510732217
L ? l = l / 2 [ k2es / d . km ] 1 / 2 this is.	10.2346373345726
So , they can be easily released from the polymer mold , the other examples of surface - active agents , which are used for this parsing a solid filler in polymer matrices.	8.679537530501094
Now , look at sum of the final sum of the polymers and solvent common solvent like acetone delta value 20.3 c c l 6, this example of take few polymer like polystyrene , this is some polymer polystyrene 18.5 and bis phenyl poly carbonate its around 19.5 to 2.	10.8680513364152
So , in that case , there is a limitation , there is a limit at which you can take out the condensate from a system.	7.417354957243067
If you simplify this you can write ( sb - ss ) / j = 1 / kl that is the inverse of the film diffusion coefficient and also ss / j = 1 /.	8.950130515476578
For example l - alanine to d - alanine.	9.036429417579662
So , that is one of the very important question for polymer chemist at this movement and obviously now a days , polymers are finding newer and newer applications , not polymers or not only applies for the commodity applications.	8.286376631928869
Radical polymerization , we are talking about the chain polymerization , and different structure and different initiator now we , start solely on radical chain polymerization.	8.642359544634164
And these are two examples where the psi factor is negative and theta has to be lower than theta two to get the mixing possible.	10.14036339212608
L . under what conditions.	10.288106008178719
Similar case for m m a , m m a also a one one substituted and same logic can apply here because these are resulting a strain polymer the del h actually.	11.449483089339907
If the ratio of km / s0 is very , very small you will hardly incur any error if you assume it to be a first order.	8.915516396527646
So , that we do the reaction till all the benzoquinone and hydroquinone gets consume after that normal reaction happens.	7.850319484596445
But analytical solutions may be difficult.	9.898260737790485
The higher value of ks * means the enzyme binds ab * more tightly than the substrate molecules.	9.238245876728277
Now at equilibrium , which is a case of melting , so at melting , delta g m would be zero , t is t m melting point.	9.907578167398881
You have learned that the polymers have larger molecular weight and invariably , either of these synthetic processes you land up in distribution of molecular.	9.594058096294482
Up to quite a large particle size it can be considered almost free of diffusional limitations.	11.078129164419462
So , you require a polar solvent to have these charges separated and ions as free as possible.	8.042127891501154
Now for example , if we assume first that the reactivity of this two monomers is same , then if i take a fifty - fifty ratio of the feed monomer composition by more person , by number , then obviously the chances of that a o h will react with another a o h to form a carbonate; will be given by 0.5 in to 0..	10.396005219540687
So , weight fraction of x mar is the weight of all molecules of x mar divided by total weight of the mixture , if n x is the number of molecules having x structural units.	7.868799441880894
That means that the rate will increase rate of polymerization will be , will increase with increase in temperature.	7.864230418737046
But for small molecules which have all the molecules have same molecular weight fragmentation does not matter , because the highest molecular ion will represents the molecular or will give the molecular weight for the small molecule or the molecules; but in case of polymer , one polymer sample consist of many chains of different lengths or different molecular weight.	10.344233003036459
So , what i mean the case of this allylic monomer.	8.345741265129403
In the presence of enzyme , methane mono oxygenase at 25c and obviously at ambient pressure the turn over number is 2.2 x 103, a much higher value although it is lower than the one which is obtained at 400c and few hundred atmospheres.	9.412470089266172
If it is a thin film it can be thickness of the film; if its a spherical bead it can be diameter of the bead or any characteristics parameter l may be defined as.	11.655284772594925
So , they are perfectly , they are completely amorphous nor crystality.	10.36826846892694
So under those conditions and assuming s0 equal to1m and epsilon of 0.5, the erel in the case of first order regime at 0.8 is 1.2.	11.050199573728651
And then we also , we will understand how the long range steric interactions effect the polymer chain dimension; and then the end we will start the discussion on frictional properties of polymer molecules in dilute solution.	8.887224042925594
In addition to your study of various biomolecules in other courses like biochemistry , we have separate course on enzymes and some of these aspects i will be dealing in today s lecture , which will basically be of introductive nature and also give you the scope of this course.	10.013238471688064
In this case , intra - molecular photon transfer is possible , which actually gives you a dead polymer chain and again initiated to coinitiator complex and if inter - molecular chain transfer happen , chain transfer to polymer happens , then you get a branched , branched chain or you get branched , branched polymer.	10.14241727575455
For large variety of hydrolytic reactions acids or hydrogen ions can act as a catalytic function.	9.661071932689703
Now , as i said that the extent of cyclization in comparison to linear polymerization depends upon both , thermodynamic factor and as well as kinetic factor.	8.131570154022592
And , we are talking about average.	7.473245691516624
And at higher temperature , polymers some time depolymerisation depolymerise , which might lead to some volatile monomers.	9.420546263414497
Now , what happens if you have higher k.	9.615105089010639
From the kinetics of step polymerization you should understand that you know to achieve high conversion and as a result high molecular weight.	9.251304080633016
So , r i which is initiation rate for single particle will be total of initiator rate by the number of particles , so i just putting this r i here to get this , so you get the molecular weight as this.	9.482185845481434
That means per unit weight of the protein its activity is much higher.	8.27830476981861
This is reaction monomer with the initiator molecule itself.	8.881339413214583
If you imagine that , it will be more more towards this region , the minima will be or the least energy would be , for larger polymer molecule , they will be more such conformations; and the lowest energy conformations will be around here , will be around say 0 degree to 90 degree range , so you can imagine that , there is numerous possible conformations for a linear polymer.	10.180994944663366
And just a brief idea about the type of application this copolymers goes.	12.642099821618597
So , we have n 0 number of cells; n 0 is given by n 1 plus x n .	6.304222969566163
A typical case is shown here.	6.922994083322803
On the other hand there is an optimum water concentration which is required but when water is produced water has to be removed rather being added.	9.630447947851893
That means at a very fast rate the reactants must go into the transition state or they must have higher concentration of ab *.	7.971257139361893
Take for example a cofactor like a nad.	10.172483907912408
And now the cis - trans isomer of diene polymer , they have different t g s.	10.282917318399605
If you can start a polymer or you can polymerize alpha methyl styrene at 25 degree centigrade , then the polymerization will take place till the concentration becomes 2.2 moles per liter.	9.394992783889718
In this class , in this lecture , what we will do is we will continue the discussion on kinetics of step polymerization and then , go for predicting the number average degrees of polymerization for a step - polymerization which is happening in a close system , and that will give us the importance of equilibrium constant of a step polymerization reaction.	8.452308369587742
To have a high functional reactivity one need as much of enzyme.	8.789278730326794
Or like we discussed alkyl metal alkyl lithium or aryl metal you can use to initiate the anionic chain polymerization or radical anion also anionic species like sodium , naphthalene they also they are same types of initiator , as we talked about the our discussion on anionic chain polymerization.	10.165040816593736
In earlier stabilization studies we saw that a two stage model is the most accepted model for enzyme which consists of two steps , native protein going into an unfolded form and then irreversible inactivation to in - active enzyme.	10.272858405066536
Tortousity means , is the path , one has to travel to cross that thickness.	13.168045799877529
T and then one can substitute or write down the integration term in terms of s.	14.441942935184596
Then we have to look also the inhibition pattern if any.	8.5201128354537
Hence the actual t g lies between a t g which is somewhere between , predicted by this two expression.	9.794405370326919
Now , we get it once s more time this the expression for k p is just for your reminder that this is this.	9.046572096510186
This is not a single reagent.	8.309951209237203
Now , the feasibility of this polymerization from a ring to linear product linear monomer to polycyclic monomer to a linear product , like all other reactions depends both on thermodynamic and thermo dynamic and last kinetic factor.	9.042151537501885
So a large number of engineering operations including mass transfer , heat transfer , material balance , energy balance , product separation , kinetics , thermodynamics is also involved in understanding of enzyme science and therefore one of the characteristic feature is that the whole enzyme science interfaces with a large number of basic engineering sciences and it is this interface which makes it so attractive to study , exciting to study and important to study.	10.803066701540125
So , as the molecular weight and we call this as retardation , whether is fourth case thus the worst case , where k is lower than k p and k transfer is higher than k p.	7.63968506161397
By changing the bulk environment hydrolysis can be tailored to be used for synthetic reactions as well.	9.795472713652057
If suppose this enzyme was not a bio catalyst.	9.179517796183783
So , what is the relation between repeat unit and structure unit , in this case; and each repeating unit contains 2 structure units.	7.735079276947827
So , if i write this as m n dot , this is a m m dot , then this will be m n plus m.	8.176715922844203
The whole function is dependent upon a very subtle conformation.	9.588731984673709
So , we know that from the raw data of gpc trace we can get the number of distribution and weight average molecular weight , and weight molecular rate , and we can also get the other m z , and from the values of k and we can get k v also.	9.645602327157548
So , proper choice of monomer is also very important.	8.215081319740019
That is possible but again to use it in terms of convenience use of ph electrode is very simple.	9.648972354491066
Now the scattering happen , due to in homogeneities in the refractive index in the medium.	8.041728338651968
Now , each mma each mma munity will have 3 hydrogen , so how many mma munity , if you divided if you divide 12.85 by 3 which is 4 2 8 around 4.28 munity of mma.	10.543233701694394
This v bar is specific volume of polymer and v 1 is molar volume of solvent , then we can write the number of segments like this; and we define the term b as this.	9.843324571162535
Now , in case for high polymers for high molecular weight polymers high molecular weight polymers again the probability is always the probability of propagation is higher because that is why it is propagating p also tends to .	9.608539517666733
In case of polar solvent you can have specific interaction between the polymer and the solvent.	6.919550492967359
That means you donot use a high substrate concentration right at the beginning.	6.990871160806288
So , you get a half here , a additional half.	6.847037723674944
So , what happen if we found those particular vibration bands or ir peaks , then we know the , we can assure the presence of those particular functional groups in the polymer , which help us to characterize the polymer molecules.	9.587498341685478
It can react with a monomer and again go back to the domain form because is equilibration process or reversible process , so that all the radicals , all the propagating radicals we generate from the initial initiation reaction , they will spend more or less same amount of time in as active form and as a domain form which will ensure that all the polymer chains are progressing or reacting during or for a same number , same amount of time or same duration.	9.945636313394106
Obviously , advantage the advantage disadvantage which we had for your bulk polymerization.	8.529774602149118
If you increase the time the polymer molecular weight will be higher and higher.	6.663216884951986
The reason is the basic assumption in the hills equation is that the enzyme at equilibrium will be in the form of esn whereas there will be small concentration of all other enzyme species.	10.058037269852198
If you want to control the molecular weight , if have want some reason you want to target some molecular weight with both the ends having some particular functional group or no functional group.	9.256816247278572
Now , let us take an experimental observation of an external catalyzed system.	6.286646520034983
And r t is twice k t m dot square m dot value is listed here , k t his 10 to the power 6 10 to the power 8 liter whole inverse second inverse.	9.14871577695537
Its structural behavior can be very easily understood with the computer graphics which otherwise doing experimentally probably is a herculean task.	11.051473670988926
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
For you have you have initiator lot of polymers together , all the polymers together and you have continuing all this polymers all this polymers is undergoing polymer propagation reaction , this during the same duration.	11.256581262349787
Then you have hydroxy acids or hydroxy amine and then they can intra molecularly react and cyclize.	9.726234637222998
Now , what is what can be done is basically you do several reactions.	7.624106018571562
The substrate itself is not catalytically active , it is only enzyme which is a catalytically active component and if suppose we assume a simplistic case wherein the substrate can ionize and give you a protonated form of substrate with the ionization constant of k.	10.006485667759023
Polymers can be classified as according to the chain structure.	8.896187056236544
So , blow molding , basically the molding is done by blowing higher through a molten polymers , so that thin flames that can be done easily if you have a good melt flow behavior and polyethylene s are used mostly as films for packaging materials , for house hold and agricultural construction application.	11.152441577615585
Both the reaction rates will be identical and so you can write as k3.eab.	11.337251592073772
There is no water present in the proximity of the enzyme molecule and the hydrophobic matrix and the enzyme is immobilized in a hydrophobic patch and it is suspended then in the organic solvent.	8.761280626965558
The famous jacob - monod model , the lac - operon model was the one earliest study as far as the regulation of proteins are concerned and induction is a very common tool for regulation of the enzyme synthesis.	10.28802340595292
So , it is very important crucial to know you know the repeat units , we may have used a particular monomer , whether that monomer exist in the same form as repeat unit we need to find out; what is the end group of that polymer , what is the molecular microstructure in terms of homopolymer.	11.03185061268219
But the fact is that these catalysts have not found such a wide spread use as far as industry is concerned excepting in some conventional applications in foods or pharmaceuticals which are the natural processing agent in the case of industrial applications.	9.961782391280602
But i said , that in practice , in industry , when one makes a step polymer , seldom the distribution , the pdi value comes to around 2, always it is found to be slightly above 2, say between 2 to 2.5 and so on.	9.545539849940154
Either you start the reaction from a known a feed ratio or stop the reaction at a very low conversion say less than 5 percent , but that is not very practical.	9.908441561607209
That means the factors that are dictated by the immobilization enzyme preparation itself.	8.102454380043026
This is for your alpha ch 3 of the pmma group , and these peaks are these 3 carbon atom from polystyrene backbone , and this took hydrogen from the pmma background.	10.651982711595114
They are presenting the maximum number , but its weight reach matters most , not the number in terms of polymer property is.	10.39439635538714
Just to explain the concept for example you take polyacrylamide , which is a water soluble polymer.	9.4011953509818
Epsilon , while in the case of a stirred bed reactor , is taken to be one.	9.83742968221267
I have r s and s r , giving 2 r s dot , or i have tetrazenes , which breaking and giving 2 r n to r 2 n dot plus nitrogen , or it could be other peroxides; for example you have potassium , it can have these peroxides as well.	9.923709510183993
For example in the case of chemical catalyst raneys nickel , it is the catalyst used for all hydrogenation reactions in the organic chemical field and we can produce them in bulk quantities and the cost of production can be reasonably low.	9.538456102349121
There are additives , which are used in polymer formulations , which basically assist in processing and fabrication , or in assembly , like lubricants , mold release agents which basically help in reducing the mold from after the brat is formed processing head , adhesion promoters , scavenger and acid neutralizer , catalyst quenchers; they are some other examples , general examples of this type of additives.	9.868557723071142
They stay in the solution or in the reaction medium all the time during the reaction and here also , there are some exceptional cases that this equal reactivity or the functional group does not apply , but we are not talking about those cases in this course because they are exceptional cases and most of you know all those common reactions and the reactions we come across always follow this rule of a equal reactivity of the functional group.	10.63214140386987
We can recollect there , which means , that this always preferred to a step polymerization with high monomer concentration , which means , that if you are doing it in a solution , then you do it in a higher concentration and if it is possible to do in a bulk where we have only the monomers and the catalyst , that is the preferred situation.	9.957752806303995
Now , why why you are , you will ask me why you are , why you need to study polymers , why we should be interested in studying polymer or polymer chemistry.	9.399308193967432
So , if you have a 3, 4 addition , then you will get a molecule like this.	5.81777017089956
And then we will talk about ziegler - natta polymerization and then we briefly talk about metallocene polymerization and give some example of commercial coordination polymers.	8.073135556993186
So , that will in effect not allow polymer to expand.	7.857529472651924
Now , if any distributions have more smaller molecules than expected m w and m n , both will come down and as you know that smaller molecules effect more than m n than m w.	8.757280460567996
How to analyze or what are the experimental constraints within which the steady state hypothesis must be considered valid.	11.378182131541005
So , basically you can have three possible arrangements for these same as here.	7.210010179379693
As far as availability is concerned there are two major factors.	9.11059458837292
Now this gives you the temperature; compare between these two isoprene free radical polymerization at 20 degree centigrade and isoprene free radical polymerization at 100 degree centigrade.	9.007796921749058
Therefore this can be integrated to give c / c0 = 1 - exp ( - qt / v ) this is the theoretical output for a step change in a cstr.	11.264364568212734
Some times it may look in the case of living systems that certain reactions that are catalyzed are in totality have a positive free energy change.	11.200281472487712
So , the reaction is slower compared to your normal chain polymerization and as you know that we discussed this most cases this are leaving.	9.134708703384772
And if it is the solvent is such that , the theta solvent where the chain contraction due to unfavorable polymer solvent interaction exactly compensate , the excluded the expansion due to excluded volume effect , and you get that the expansion factor is .	10.35465969033514
Now , obviously they come in case of car also they clients are very important.	9.51239101089234
So , if you consider a polymer solution , where if you consider the polymer solutions , now if you consider its area any area or any particular area from this solution which contain pure solvent another part contain the solute and the solvent.	8.271156828495842
If you lower the temperature; obviously , this isomerization become less and less probable then the most stable structure which is a trans structure will polymerize which will product.	10.460183411779028
It is alkylate; first it is alkylate , the metal and then abstract one halogen and form metal ion and which generates one vacant or vital.	10.158751213004619
What we must appreciate is that the variety of specificity that can occur in the case of enzymatic reaction can be very loosely specific in terms of group specific enzymes , absolute specificity with respect to a single substrate; it can be stereochemically specific with respect to substrate or with respect to product.	11.76436703780122
When we wrote mechanistic expression for enzyme substrate binding , we are taking one substrate molecule which binds towards enzyme molecule thereby assuming that the enzyme possesses only one substrate binding site which is also not true in many cases.	11.279309428232867
For example you look at let us see the approximate pka values.	10.341592253333303
Which is called as effectiveness factor.	9.226465293438485
By determining the end group quantitatively , we can also determine the molecular weight; quantitative determination of end group gives m n number average molecular weight.	9.015535807396153
The reaction performance equation gets modified and as you will notice that in the case of substrate inhibition , the performance of cstr will be far superior.	8.37200495239204
Now , this term copolymers are used generally when you have a polymers which are synthesized from two different monomers where the monomers can be polymerized independently , which means in this case styrene as well as the mma can be polymerized to , individually can aim to polystyrene and poly methyl methacrylate.	10.301118454816356
Hence , the viscosity drop is less.	10.675489850964405
You see lactic acid to acrylic acid.	9.312377497634818
You have to bring down the phenol level in the system to such a low level , but as i said that sometimes , it is limited by the design of the reactor , it is not possible.	10.475065532781896
Let me just summarize one more time the features.	11.38616481834957
What happens if you increase the polar solvent , polarity of the solvent.	11.239130805872879
The potential of 0.5 to 0.8 volts is usually applied across the electrode and the current generated is proportional to the concentration of the substrate in the sample.	7.847975717354515
Part of the energy required for energy of activation is already met by strain onto the substrate molecule.	9.691502006224567
So , you get a polymer for example you have ethylene here and in this side after polymerization you have polyethylene.	8.434320358162466
Similarly , there is another part also can scatter light and it is going to the detector.	9.702423346771395
It gets fluidized; the particles are fluidized in the reactor system almost like as shown here in the reactor but not to the extent that the catalyst particles are driven out of the reactor system.	9.671163718066657
So , that it does not pollute the environment.	6.525341108360264
We will stop at this point.	3.7475559917302608
Many of the reactions can be catalyzed simply by acids or alkalis and the basic mechanism is that by certain transfer of electrons or protons to the reactants the catalyst can reduce the energy of activation.	7.474405743209058
Now , in the second half of that lecture , we will start the rising opening polymerization.	7.560360741087564
So , this is this is short range steric restriction , now we start our discussion with a simple molecule of n butane , and we found out how the conformation , what are the confirmations this normal butane can take , and how the potential energy changes with different conformations.	9.749872857264025
So , it is always likelihood that pure end - to - end distance will be higher , compared to when there was no restriction of potential.	7.168311280034987
A large number of methods are used to determine protein concentration , as you may be familiar with , and all of them are linked or based on the native structure of protein , the constituent amino acids of a protein.	8.806891551041089
This means basically as we know that like the polymers which are a similar structure or similar sort of interaction behavior with a solvent will dissolve in that solvent.	9.62693274825924
The specific volume will go down.	7.376398334337772
So , it can be added in this many ways.	8.005496187149417
That means 10 % of gluteraldehyde on the basis of protein content in the mixture and that is allowed to react for time period ranging from say about one to three hours to twenty four hours.	10.04913052616369
The other part is because of their bulk production the cost has also come down and become reasonable for commercial applications.	9.642483879244972
Hence , the reactivity order of these different radicals towards a monomer will be inverse towards the stability of this radical.	9.213200044716379
So , if there are in homogeneities present , in the polymeric material , there could be , or there will be , bulk scattering; for example , if you have some particles , so small particles which are , there are voids or some have bubbles are there , then in a homo polymer metrics.	10.370535796509717
This is z average molecular weight , but most commonly this two terms are used and those are sufficient for your description of your sample and to quantify the breadth of the distribution this term is used poly dispersive index or simply sometimes dispersive index which is given by this ratio.	9.732945755251174
They get destroyed to form dead molecules.	10.016583424602942
Now how when you do a chain polymerization on these types of monomers , how can you imagine what are the possible polymers these monomers are forming.	10.695544183216548
And this is these are the trade names of this polymers in this trade name they are sold radel and udel.	10.695218566219516
If the system doesn t undergo substrate inhibition that is if it undergoes inhibition , we have no choice other than to using a lower substrate concentration.	9.569671601575957
So , hydrodynamic volume will be lower in this case.	7.3478465779464255
These are the only two patterns which will lead to synthesis of ea and none another because in all other patterns there will be no reversible step.	9.356959926350822
So , after all this exercise we got this entropy of mixing for the polymers; for the polymers in a solution is give by this expression and this expression is same as the ideal solution of small molecules.	8.907224846410223
If you take a combination of enzyme in carrier concentration and at equilibrium measure the concentration in the solid phase and the liquid and you make an isotherm , then you may end up sometime in some cases a linear relationship where q is equal to k . y to make the isotherm , take different ratios of the carrier and the enzyme activity.	9.915655648766391
The rate profile will be vm = k e0 k / h + + k you can again analyze the same way and the profile obtained will be reverse of this and you get pk value.	8.727898265613609
And this do not get dominated if you increase decrease the temperature.	9.088405270676176
These are the different techniques and what i have done is i have just listed the principles and some of these techniques are absolute techniques; that means we do not require any calibration by the polymers of no molecular weight.	8.81338905395369
One mole of product per second is a very large unit.	10.405687522619296
So cstr coupled with an ultra filtration reactor can be easily used for carrying out a reaction with the soluble enzyme or with insoluble substrates.	9.946667669518591
First issue that i want to draw your attention is the bio processing with co - factor linked enzymes.	9.873215966861531
Hence the t g goes up , but if you increase the length of the side chain , as you have seen in case of t g as well; that the chain rotation is mainly determine by first one or two pendent groups.	8.945651432040332
A is a competitive inhibitor and p is a non - competitive inhibitor . you can also arrive at cases we there is substrate inhibition also and life can be very , very complex in such cases.	10.347736847216717
It is significant to note that most of the enzymes that are present in the living cells are bi - substrate reactions.	7.601417895669371
It doesn t take care of that.	7.171419569226797
Therefore one can determine the value of ki as we saw in the case of competitive inhibitor by a secondary plot.	7.130405584042076
You will see from this relationship that maximum effectiveness factor can be one because that means the you have a enzyme reaction rate under the condition when the whole enzyme particle is flooded with the substrate , the same substrate concentration what is present at surface is present across the particle , at all surface at all the pores and under that condition the effectiveness factor will be one.	10.816451962795734
And then start the propagation reaction and which will finally , lead to a polymer molecule.	8.992522181367473
The regenerated enzyme again went down and it can be again regenerated and this cycle is continued over almost about thirty two days period.	11.363489362894903
If you stop here as a 95 percent level , then you see lot of polymer , large chain polymers and the small amount of monomers and the left over initiators , ok.	10.501264608423652
If this is a radical , then obviously this is s p .	11.111848294950038
This is sulfanilamide and this is para amino benzoic acid.	9.432111967101902
One can choose an expensive carrier provided the carrier can be regenerated at the end of the exhaustion of the enzyme.	7.774846014597477
But , obviously , that does not restrict us to use highest technique to polymer characterization , because the functional groups present in a in a molecule , it may be in the polymer as well , they do not change the absorption the absorption in ir whether , it is present in a small molecule or a large polymer molecule.	9.888678286799001
We will determine the pka values and their role.	9.687943115519293
Now as you will see in after few lectures that most of this polymer characterization techniques for example , molecular measurements , chemical characterization , etc are done in solution.	10.405369912564007
You have achieved a good binding but the enzyme active sites are hindered from access to the substrate molecule.	8.071813370646554
So , this is a perfect elastic material , what happened to their perfect viscous material , how the strain will change every time.	8.207911656325136
If we cannot take out the condensate from the reaction medium , such a way , such a high level , so that the residual level of the condensate in the polymerized medium is low , for whatever reason.	8.605007332568942
Now , before i going to this , let us show you some number of just to say these are tabulated from known values.	9.818372261866898
If you compare all the methods based on the initial quantity of amino acylase used , the activity recovered in the immobilized form and the yield level activity , the method based on immobilization of amino acylase by ionic binding to deae sephadex proved to be the best in terms of its enzyme activity; seven thirteen units per gram or what ever unit they have used and with fifty eight point nine percent yield of the recovery of the activity from the soluble enzyme as compared to various methods where the activity recovery as well as the final activity of immobilized preparation was much lower.	9.958563307722782
Now , we have talked about that one one substituted disubstituted monomers also difficult to polymerize.	7.303780284715232
So the enzyme activity loss as a result of diffusional limitations is a totally apparent loss.	10.220645462235344
So , this will be eta reduced plot for eta reduced and the other one will be plot eta inherent.	9.724254034004073
That will entirely depend on the pka value of the two charges.	7.880191008762028
You get a slope of - km and the intercept on the y axis is vm itself.	9.272632730376
Normally when these amino acids are synthesized by chemical route , they are residual mixture of d&amp; l and we get in final stage as dl - acyl amino acid.	10.654519917457167
For polymer molecules for polymer solutions this non - ideality is generally due to both.	10.728688607658826
We are talking about organic solvent , so it is not very environmental friendly and the person scientist finally either.	9.739782838497643
What is the utility , importance.	9.54320863707053
So that kind of a series is based on large number of methods which have been reported by people in the literature and also the average composition of protein.	11.20128450041143
Examples , where x a is solvent , if i take carbon tetrachloride , then it can take up chloride and form ccl 3 dot.	11.74644577509053
An electrophoretically homogeneous protein means it is a perfectly pure enzyme.	12.143366433666476
Diffusional effects , then degree of conversion versus residence time at different initial substrate concentration , the reactor performance profile and finally the operational and storage stability.	11.94492701189684
So , there could be a attractive interaction between the polymer molecule.	6.876245725770774
So , if it is solution you have to take out the polymers from the solution in a powder form and if it is in a bulk or in a melt form you can use as such and if it is in emulsion cases like some cases it is in emulsion.	9.534122389547376
Now , one thing also we should remember in case of step polymerization , that the chains , when the chains are forming during the reactions , the chains can , there is a possibility , that chains can also undergo exchange reaction between them and making the chains reacting with each other.	8.885903643937848
That is why the concept of three interacting sites fairly explains the position of enzymes catalytic action as far as their specificity with respect to stereo isomers is concerned.	9.238919453021888
So , it will be homo polymers of styrene and some alternate of copolymer of vinyl and vinyl acetate and styrene.	8.305919708161074
So , in a general course like this of on polymer chemistry , we are not going in details on this type of specialized polymerization technique.	8.726770553145156
So , this polymer is formed by condensation reaction , but the definition we came up in the last few minutes back where condensation polymers at this represented by this anything else are called addition polymers.	9.042336957176964
Ks is the substrate inhibition constant , dissociation constant and km is the natural km value for the reaction.	10.081685196264194
We will not go into very details into derivation.	8.36045497836294
And what happened at the beginning.	12.863390370096454
Now , so these are the things you can try out , if your reaction goes wrong and of course , if this nothing else work with this you might have to consider changing your reaction monomer , you are changing your monomers all together.	10.282273645358451
So , we will start from this page in the next lecture.	3.7193263749135688
Time would have been 90 degree.	12.864937016055991
It is a dead end complex and then the binding site on the enzyme which is bound by the substrate is not able to give the product.	9.12452738013372
In case of notched izod test , you clamp this specimen upto the notch , this both side and hammer on the top part.	9.613650315981207
The so called ligand binding sites and when we consider ligand binding site along with the catalytic sites what we consider as active sites on the molecule they constitute for the specificity and we will discuss that in our subsequent lecture.	10.608799513164469
And we used gaussian distribution function to get or understand the end - to - end , rms end - to - end distance for that , then if the chain or the backbone , polymer backbone become stiff , then polymer the coil , the random coil becomes more elongated , and it is become worm like; and if it is if the backbone becomes more stiff , then ultimately the chain become like a rod , so these are the possible shapes a polymer chain can take.	9.132228293047685
The ratio of the two was considered as kd , the dissociation constant of es.	9.079838955485393
So if i write the probability as p i , then the number of ways the second segment can be placed is z p; p is the probability that the cell is vacant.	9.562369194506648
So , they will try to find a place to go , are you clear i is forming giving rise to initiator radical say r dot , now r dot will react with m the concentration of m is very small , so r dot will react with m and form oligomeric propagating radical.	9.077349713409854
We will start from this q e scheme , briefly talk about this and briefly talk about the ionic copolymerization and very briefly on the application part of this copolymerization and start.	9.268291347677282
If i just give you a example of real life , say i have taken a bowl of rice and you want to take out rice with a spoon , you can easily take out because each individual rice units behave independently.	10.755717052481478
So , obliviously this will have more tendency for react or undergoing transfer reaction with c c l 4 than trim ethylamine.	9.473248792981828
Other types of uv stabilizer , hindered amine light stabilizer hals , which basically arrest the chemical chain reaction resulting from the free radical , which basically are free radicals scavengers.	11.542923565529538
And in case of huggins this is positive; the slope will be positive.	8.090450279880896
The second parameter is salts.	8.764446145341793
I like you to do this exercise and solve this differential equation under this boundary condition and arrive at two things; one is the substrate concentration profile within the immobilized enzyme particle and interms of surface substrate concentration and second thing is this length from the centre , the value of lc at which the substrate concentration tends to be zero.	10.203270874311684
Now , this is the last slide we had stopped in last lecture.	6.632215564482813
So , basically a propagating chain a chain propagates and the monomers get added and the chain ends.	9.578322343668793
So , this emphasize even for example , at say 94 percent conversion you have only 16 d p which is not a polymer yet , it is a still a oligomer.	11.110925885407662
Or in a very broader sense if you consider the reaction in immobilized enzyme reactor it will imply that in addition to the biochemical reaction there will be four more resistances involved.	10.941048150273692
The fractional conversion becomes constant with time.	8.956697611580998
I donot consider it necessary that a third inhibitor to be added it can be either substrate or product which can cause inhibition which has to be taken into account while making a reacted regime while analyzing the reactor performance.	10.018740647865508
So , heat deflection temperature is a temperature at which , the material flows shows significant amount of the deformation , under a constant load.	9.48484854795983
S / r so a very simple situation arrives that if you determine the km values for an enzyme catalyzed reaction experimentally at a number of temperatures and then make a plot between ln km and 1 / t you end up in a straight line with a slope of.	9.133870437715599
Now , as the name suggest , in this case the initiation is from an anionic species , whether it is a cation or anion.	9.574756105405243
So , to get an average or to improve properties , so what we will do.	7.1727184615960535
So , if you have two blocks , which are not visible , then we are going to get two t gs for the corresponding homopolymer.	7.415539153019767
They are coupled there by producing effect which could be a polymerization reaction.	8.236571850624403
We take advantage of the thermal stability of the enzyme.	7.842851932807032
Many of the kinetic analysis in the early stages when i say early stages i am referring to the late 18th century or early 19th century when people tried to understand the kinetic behavior and i think one of the earliest recorded interpretations or results of the kinetic analysis of enzyme was by o sullivian and tompson as early as 189.	10.437180778788887
Now , we had discussed this , these molecules and their reactivity , now as we are discussing that if the more stable radical will have a tendency to react or undergo transfer reaction compared to the less stable one.	9.466912917552866
We had yesterday also discussed that in the method of metal salt linkage by repeated use you can increase the distance of the enzyme molecule from the support matrix.	10.697883107160143
So , that your side reactions comes down as low as possible , one side reactions we can consider during polyester formations.	9.754806212387171
This two can react and form a connection between two linear chains.	9.861837158165113
So , we had initiation in earlier page.	7.5861206099440475
Take a carboxylic group containing matrix put into enzyme solution it won t make a covalent bond because you need an activated matrix.	10.654088492534013
So , in case of a liquid , or a fluid if i apply as a shear stress to a fluid , energy dissipated in fluid , basically flows and energy is dissipated , energy is not stored.	9.118064239133846
Similarly in the case of first order regime it is again the same thing that the km is usually greater than 10s0 ten fold increase usually gives you a reasonable performance towards a first order regime as you have noticed that in the case of zero order regime the reactor performance is identical in both the cases in cstr and plug flow reactor excepting that the magnitude of the tau is altered by epsilon that is voidage.	9.827614621517736
Let us say you have an immobilized enzyme particle which is non - porous in nature.	9.36849959318798
If you just analyze this steady state hypothesis with respect eac which is acylated enzyme complex you get the reaction velocity as v0 = e0.s.	10.658587860843525
Although it may not always be true if the protein is not in its functional form , it will loose its status of the enzyme.	10.077186803549383
Is that alright.	14.540073960773794
So , we can write d eta s p by c by d c; this is the slope k that is proportional linear.	8.530400106667258
You can have facility for ph control with some inconvenience; may be some more additional equipments has to be added but still that will be better because the quantity of the enzyme required will be much less and that gives us a significant advantage for using immobilized enzyme in pfr and that is one of the reasons why you will notice in the literature that almost about 70 - 80 % of the total reports which appear on the use of the immobilized enzymes are in a plug flow reactors and the advantage lies in the quantity of the enzyme required and this advantage will keep on reducing.	10.387305266234364
So , you can understand that in this case , always the ends will have a functional group of a , which cannot react with each other.	7.440510848229762
Some of the ionisable groups found in proteins are not only aspartic acid and lysine or glutamic acid that contribute to the ionization state of a protein.	9.281750673288322
So we are considering the two extreme conditions either a plug flow behavior or a completely back mix system.	9.238692158997
For example the references as i have listed here by chand and associates , which was reported in 1971 had asparagine in nylon microcapsules.	9.734533378340686
That was a major contribution in the understanding of the enzyme functions made by linus pauling.	12.18725342287622
But , if you have a situation where your initiation is faster compared to the propagation of chain formation rate that means initiation happens quickly at the beginning and as your chain or monomers get added to the reactive chain ends then your polymer chain grows linearly , as you more and more monomers get added to the reactive in chain ends more and more polymer gets added.	10.195875954771731
So , in this case you require a definitive knowledge about polymers which will enable you to develop or innovate new polymer molecules or new polymer applications.	8.07355620168776
Now if , please remember that , if the sign this t g , the t g of the homopolymer in a block co polymer , will depend upon the size or the molecular weight of co polymers , as you we know that the t g also depends on the molecular weight , of the polymers , so if we talk about the small block , then we are going to get slightly less t g , then a large homopolymer , so that part you have to keep it in mind.	10.517604893292884
Now , just look at this transfer once , typically in normal cases , the transfer to monomer and initiator are very negligible.	9.828323081999832
The enzyme active site binds onto the substrate molecule.	6.182341879563097
If they are defined more from a stress strain curve from the mechanical properties , if i plot strain versus stress or a polymer sample , then elastomers are like small strain , the small stress.	10.503910683709265
If you look at some of the aspect of enzymes and the process via catalyst , a very broad picture which refers to the role of enzymes as the bio catalyst , we must be aware that all these enzymes functions at the ambient conditions at the conditions at which living cells are known to live.	10.005775235698355
They have a covalent bond.	8.41104798327757
The only difference will be when ses gives you a product and the rate of product formation will be 2k2 because it will lead to es + p and se + p.	9.184584736076978
Your hand is analogues to substrate.	11.598927849305424
Alternatively there might be some channeling effect.	9.85470880613858
Again like earlier , it is the conversion multiplied by the initial mole of the monomer , and the conversion of the raft reagent plus the conversion of the initiator.	11.82135352466685
Operational stability is defined in terms of half life.	12.52531727162433
They are placed in a sealed thermostated chamber which is saturated with the solvent vapor.	9.863337081127158
In general although the enzymes catalyse very desirable chemical transformations like fumaric acid to malic acid or maleic acid to aspartic acid but often they convert only substrate that have limited commercial interest.	9.381175885340127
Now , that is because this polymer made from this one one substituted alkynes are going to generate when this five one this s p 2 is converted to s p 3 they are going to give lot of strain.	9.86689971930144
Or there would be generation of this mono functional chain stopper , which will which will stop your polymer chains to progress further.	11.21131807492161
And what you have to do to tackle this you will understand what is going on and understand the chemistry behind this side reaction and then do whatever now your best way to minimize this side reaction unwanted reactions.	10.159503216037972
Such methods are very commonly used not only for enzymes but even for some of other biocatalysts like cells , this provides a very viable method for immobilization.	9.566350013254976
It could be homogeneous , if the polymer formed remain in in the solution it will be heterogeneous.	12.527001768893916
While storing it should not generate radicals , or it is the initiator molecules should not be such that , it is very difficult.	10.50790641246647
So , we will consider aa number of a groups reacted is fraction in the total present , initially p into p multiplied by n a.	8.176749618950039
Just by looking at the structure you should be able to tell or you should be able to identify , what is the difference you know in which method by which method it has been synthesized.	9.708386524596841
We have seen this relations before; hence we can expect from this and this relation , and whatever we have seen here that log has if the k and a remains constant , log m should linearly decrease with elution volume or v e.	10.147130625232917
The expressions are very simple and if you have the data available for any reactor performance for s0, fraction of conversion required , you can determine the volume of the reactor required or the feed rate required depending on the tau and one can make computation to define the reactor performance under given conditions.	11.639936266855779
So , what does this spectra help us , this spectra can give us the idea about the composition , for example , if we talk about this 5 hydrogen see , if i consider just consider that you have one styrene molecule , one styrene one styrenic unit rather in the polymer background , so it have 5 hydrogen now the integration corresponded to this is 1.00, so this is 1.00 for 5 hydrogen.	10.028330338335277
Under control for ph conditions one can use different functional groups of the enzyme protein depending on the amino acid groups that are available at the active site to produce an immobilized enzyme preparation by azo binding methods.	10.556318321079337
And , examples are like trivalent phosphorous , divalent sulfur compound , containing compounds , phosphites , thioesters , these are the common examples of secondary anti oxidants.	9.51267408636222
Spinodal points or spinodal cum composition , basically it is the boundary between spinodal points , spinodal composition this is the boundary between a meta stable and a unstable composition.	11.866432917437518
Whereas in the case of actual particles what we have encountered in the case of immobilized enzyme systems the path of diffusion is really not linear and uniform through out the particle and it can happen that you have pores almost going in a random manner in the whole particle and therefore the diffusivity that we obtained from theoretical considerations of a spherical particle is in effect different than what is obtainable of a particle at that dimensions assuming a uniform cylindrical pore.	9.791268220743197
If i take this bpa and bisphenol a and also some other di hydroxyl group say something else some substituted group here , instead of methyl we have ethyl group or some other group.	9.712950993770283
Vo = ( dp / dt ) t = 0 he said that once a significant quantity of product is formed the kinetic behavior changes.	11.338105294424558
The extent of non - ideality in the case of a flow pattern , the first parameter is that we must be able to identify the extent of non - ideality in the case of an enzyme reactor.	8.292570158503462
So , if you have the polymer sample weight fraction m i like this compared to something like this , this will be , they maybe have similar molecular weight average , but they , this will be much more broader , they will highly will be di value for this sample will be much higher compared to the value for this sample.	9.48379377593767
So , it happens , this happens to all the radicals and this again goes to the same reaction form , r m n br plus cu at l.	9.473659079549023
So , total number of functional group of oh group is almost close to the number of groups of coh group , so that the polymers take place.	8.074862584881062
We impact test , which is basically high strength test done it very fast fast by by applying stress in a fast rate and it can give the impact strength , the resistance of about plastic material to a impact can be given by impact stress and time dependence of polymer material can be done from a creep test.	10.983927021540865
So , if you have these , all the three plus styrene bulk solution , you get experimentally this.	8.793197627167128
And the performance of thermoplastic or plastic material depends upon the stress rate obviously , the higher you know it depends up on how we are applying the stress , loading rate , what is the amount of force , temperature and sample geometry and nature of the sample of course.	11.156918252630453
We will making chain from the monomers.	7.536815516469624
For example , if i do a ring - opening polymerization of ethylene oxide which we discussed in the last lecture.	5.368431734290016
So , if you talk about length then , it will be change in length by total length typically , we express strain in terms of percentage.	9.005029664789177
Hundred percent is perfect but very often you may not be able to test that and one will like to have fractional conversion anywhere between 0.9 and 0.9.	12.90177844817424
We are indirectly measuring glucose via measurement of dissolved oxygen.	9.110004528721044
We will let me drive the draw the mechanism in a separate page.	8.392045410361318
That might lead to the apparent effect on the enzyme activity.	10.406455763683912
The magnitude of this parameter dictates what should be the size of the t.	8.897630556856832
While these methods have academic significance from the point of view of providing certain characteristics features but for industrial reactors they are not very suitable.	9.507161809739907
So , similarly , like in case of chain polymerization we can write this expression.	7.156529515248865
The typical example is glycerol kinase.	9.186111279257403
We talked about the nature reaction is very fast reaction and we also talked about the inherent difference in the termination reaction between radical chain polymerization and ionic chain polymerization.	8.949054546420907
Now , we the stiffness can be also measured by , if you get this term , this term is basically the ratio of the unperturbed dimension divided by the dimension for a freely rotating chain.	10.582612403149499
So , insertion inserting this monomer , a new monomer in the aluminum alkyl aluminum carbon bond , which will form the regeneration of the bridge complex.	10.268151590151739
So , same type of polymers.	6.192533969958469
The number of molecules , the fraction of total number of molecules has increased , which possess sufficient energy for the transition state molecule to break down into product , and large number of molecules can then take part in the reaction and result ultimately into the product.	11.269696576067942
Now , how do we get this , to get this we found the average life time we defined average life time of a radical at steady state at steady state tau s is the concentration of total radical species as steady state by the rate of termination square or 1 by 2 k t.	9.7162388068581
When substrate concentration becomes very high the enzyme molecule might bind to two substrate molecules , one of the carboxylic groups from each of the succinic acids.	10.62342033187823
I can take both together 1 minus p plus 1 r minus p gives us n a 1 plus 1 by r minus 2 p.	9.246147022178896
So , from this is one example that using the proton nmr spectra , you can actually get the information about this , the composition of the copolymer.	8.239774113876626
Thermoplastics can be amorphous or semi - crystalline.	12.22860899725927
Now , what we now , we will shift to the new another topic which is chain dimensions.	8.737298703275204
This is a picture of a typical enzyme electrode which we used in our own laboratory.	9.587192242228468
Certain metal salts like titanium tetra chloride and ferric chloride form a kind of an inorganic bridge on the surface of the carrier and to which the enzyme molecules can couple.	10.598779432820365
We are not going into detail of those methods , but essentially , the concept or the principle of determining r 1 and r 2 is similar , where you do the reaction in different feed monomer ratios and then stop the reactions at low conversion and get the copolymer composition.	9.054192903192874
Now , it can be expressed as a percentage or it can be expressed as the fraction.	7.058863988582843
So , that is that is the way , oscillation oscillatory deformation is done so , basically it you must know this basic deformation modes to understand the subsequent test and polymer mechanical properties.	9.808679503965704
And if you at the end to the polymer if you do not want to have any reactive functional group , then you should use mono functional chain stoppers and your molecular weight , when you use a chain stoppers , what is your target molecular weight you know the calculation hence you should be knowing the calculation.	10.899969987108708
So the diffusion is involved and the time required very often is controlled by diffusional limitations and the rate of diffusion controls the time required for adsorption process.	8.939195928968559
There is a kind of transient phase till it reaches to the constant stream and that is what it defines.	10.188447405387578
Some of you must have done chromatographic experiments.	9.707696412516324
So , we get a detector response like this.	5.3034139398856714
So , if you are doing reaction of this monomers towards say styrene radical , then they will follow this strength and the radicals towards a particular monomer , say like say acrylonitrile.	8.124057086276514
So , how many molecules will be unreacted left over.	7.565913837945551
These two parameters are in . . ..	9.02503674819789
Like take maleic anhydride and stacked sullivan.	13.251966111793884
The advantage here is from the practical point of view instead of dialysate volume using about of the order of three hundred liters we are talking of one or two liters of dialysate and because you are regenerating the dialysate by removing the urea formed in the system and that kind of system is commercially available.	9.96771424973515
Now , what it does to the base polymer , the nano - fillers actually improve the some of the properties of the base polymers like strength , modulus , toughness , heat distortion temperature , uv resistances , barrier properties , we get the example of nanoclay during the discussion of barrier properties.	9.516906264895626
The advantage , the kind of problem that is faced in the case of classical analysis is the removal of the hydrolyzing agent that is acid or alkali or even the soluble enzyme.	9.744113629302158
Now , from a carbon 13 nmr spectra , we can assign each individual carbons in this polycarbonate and this is this is the special a , this carbon this carbon from the carbonate peak is special , because with help of this spectra we can find out the composition of a copolymer , which will show as a example in the new next slide.	10.829205169181781
Now what about non - ideal solution.	10.087997614525735
So , the collision frequency between the functional groups also increases.	5.402931371733761
Here v is the reactor volume and q is the flow rate in the case of a continuous reactor.	8.509186154396506
So , this give giving the maximum solubility or maximum intrinsic viscosity for that polymer if the polymers are crops linked or jelt , then we do the same experiment take the polymer and do series of put the polymer need to work in series of solvent and find out the maximum swelling ability.	10.489743363969737
The second part is the enzyme cost.	9.08725478228008
Now the confirmation or the configuration of the polymer chain will be determined by the confirmation of the adding monomer which the monomer which is getting added.	9.322140470038448
So , if i plot weight fraction between and the molecular weight or m i , this is molecular weight the curve is , will look like this , this and this will be say m n , m w , m v and this will be m z.	9.663617082380627
So there is no activity loss and that is what really i meant by the apparent loss of the enzyme activity that means by some physical interventions , by reducing the particle size one can overcome the internal pore diffusion.	10.392298152086207
Now , just to illustrate the general poly esterification; we will take a example of poly esterification as the example of step growth polymers.	8.42702357101937
There could be rearrangement , molecular rearrangement due to absorption of uv light; or , it could be , in this case it could be due to photo oxidation product , and these basically produced highly coloured product.	9.943261390498241
That means there are inhibitors and activator molecule which we normally know as effector molecules which can influence the initial reaction rate of the enzyme in the.	9.07657236345669
So , next talk about the plasticizing , the plasticizer.	11.217374292843411
Now once we had placed all the polymer molecules , now we can place the solvent molecules in the vacant cells.	9.601144996722
So , i take this molecule and n molecules of this which gives.	8.347758998833731
That means in extremely inhibited conditions the reaction rate can be very , very slow.	7.571578281673933
No . when there is a partitioning of hydrogen ions and the conditions are such that the rate of reaction as a result of partitioning increases that is the condition.	10.886079283473457
If you know k and a; if k and a are known , obviously you can find experimentally the value of intrinsic viscosity and then if you know k and a value , then you will be able to find the value for m v.	8.466561704652166
A large number of techniques are used and we will discuss them in detail.	8.887577104578003
Now , let us see what happens at the beginning at the beginning t is equal to 0, you have water with initiator , so i let us draw something like this , so this is a inside is a water medium , so you have initiator molecules dissolved in the water molecule , when you add surfactants , surfactants will form micelles.	9.329738320521942
On the other hand the apparent loss refers to the reduced enzyme activity that you are measuring but by certain physical interventions the original activity can be restored.	8.787075625832008
The chemical potential of solvent molecule in this side is higher than the chemical potential of the solvent in this side which makes solvents to move from solvent side to solution sides and thus increasing the pressure.	8.537384635243367
All the radicals will follow the reverse strength.	10.927990711563234
Obliviously , rate of polymers polymerization does not change so no change , what happen to molecular weight , obviously decreased.	13.65603861632824
But to understand the stereochemical specificity that how enzyme is able to identify the two different stereoisomers , the minimum requirements on the function of an active sites was proposed by oxten as early as 194.	11.98093314742568
The gluteraldehyde to protein ratio is also used at about 10 % weight by weight and gluteraldehyde concentration also varies over a large range from 0.2 to 0.6 % solution.	10.149083501884789
It can be shown that enthalpy component is can be expressed by this expression as well , and this term entropic contribution towards the polymer solvent interaction parameter is most cases , it happens the value of 0..	10.631575205565465
The case of penicillin acylase in detail manner has been analyzed and the reactor performance compared by warburton and associates in biotech.	12.982737719723785
So , it is very difficult to align the chains.	4.782617168381793
Now , if you want to get information or detect the scattering intensity at such low angle then you need to place your scatterer.	7.657800724645772
More and more reactor you get such the number of such polymer chains increases with conversion.	13.10511912014961
Now , we can get a highly isotactic polymers if we do a ionic polymerization such that , we have a very strong coordination between the counter ion , the monomer , the incoming monomer and the active chain and which could be a cation or an anion.	9.290557974461759
Because the substrate will be consumed and as the substrate progresses through the particle depth the concentration will be dropping down and there are two possibilities.	10.633067416305815
Now , whatever the composition in the feed; that is also in the copolymer you have; this is a the 0.1, this a 0.5, this is a 2, and this is 10, r is 0.1, r is 0.2 and 10 r .	11.95181564394069
And and we will start the other type of polymerization in the second half or the latter half of the next lecture.	9.493720963348665
Data on all these parameters must be provided to characterize the particular immobilized enzyme preparation.	10.772810529147009
So , this distribution will guess is known as flory distribution.	8.088287728771405
They are not distinct to each other , in the sense that their statistical co polymer , so you have a single phase for that.	10.151154448119533
People were able to make enzyme substrate complexes and their analogs , analyze them by nmr or epr or variety of analytical physical tools and they found that when the enzyme and substrate do bind there is a significant change in the conformation.	10.759709267995026
To sum up the type of reactors that are available the combined continuous stirred flow reactors with the ultra filtration system is useful with the soluble enzyme or along with the immobilized enzyme particularly by an insoluble substrates are required to be handled or colloidal substrates are required to be handled.	10.525008812419765
This is what we were talking about the external film diffusion and the other part of the whole story of the steady state analysis is related to internal pore diffusion.	8.616088346088643
So , the molecular weight , the average number of degrees of polymerization the weight average degrees of polymerization and the p d i is given by this expressions.	7.346539743512289
So , the total number of ways you can place both the polymers and the solvent molecules and complete or fill the three lattice will be given by this multiplied by one which will be this.	7.667865416767502
Below this temperature the polymer is the only soluble in that solvent in this composition left hand of this point and in this composition , but above this temperature the polymer is soluble in the solvent at any composition , that is called upper critical solution temperature.	9.2664232441577
Now , now lewis , lewis acid , we are talking about this reaction are the initiation , is by lewis acids.	8.877812645436078
Pressure drop will end the problem in the plug flow reactor because if you want to eliminate some of the problems associated with the internally bound diffusion in the system , the particle size has to be reduced and the reduction of particle size will mean increase in pressure drop across the bed and increase in pressure drop across the bed ultimately puts an economic barrier in terms of higher energy consumption for feeding the substrates and therefore in the case of very fine particles you can handle the system in a fluidized bed reactor without much pressure drop problems.	10.987776922334557
As we move further , increase the ph it will have one carboxylic and one amino group ionized.	9.929432057871033
Now , in this case because this is a more of an alternate copolymer as long as that more reactive monomer in this case say , r 1 is greater than 0 and r 2 is .	8.775598378145903
So from here , also if you look at the homopolymer data of vinyl acetate , and then try to utilize these data to have a idea about the copolymer composition , and the reaction rate between the vinyl acetate and the styrene , that we will be of , very little significance for these copolymerization.	12.133043983923596
And like other hdt temperature will depend upon how fast you are heating up this material , how fast you changing the temperature , and obviously , the amount of load is present.	9.954262037212311
In such a reactor if you use an enzyme by putting substrate in and taking out the product which are low molecular weight compounds and enzyme being high molecular weight molecule will be retained in the reactor during use.	10.396110576019204
So , orientation increases modulus and for a semi crystalline polymer , if we increase a some glassy additives like glass fibers in the amorphous region then , basically the elastic modulus goes up.	8.939667207709583
For a zero order system it is f = l . [ ktrue . / de.	8.821521119267102
This is the conversion of raft region.	9.04046528690047
So , viscosity becomes high and stirring become difficult.	8.378361676672137
It s a very small area on the total enzyme surface and rest of the enzyme surface either in its proximity provides some favorable reactions or very often it may be considered as only a sort of building framework structural feature which creates the active site.	10.09291410673786
There is an oxidation of ah and reduction of b and this can be done by two enzymes.	9.11096093420729
But at low substrate concentration , for.	10.746018460668305
A typical profile for relative quantity required is shown here.	7.935262873686121
So , that is a importance of kinetic chain length , that if it is goes up or goes down , then accordingly the molecular weight goes up or goes down.	7.9823494306133975
After the gel is formed , the gel is mechanically ruptured into small pieces in the form of a small granules or cut into small pieces and then can be used as a packing material in the reactors.	8.746478322775562
For a single metal follow this trend of the ligand.	10.09759374761486
Only when you add hydrogen peroxide , here hydrogen peroxide or peroxidase has been added , you get the reaction going on to a sizable extent until the time again because of some reasons either the enzyme has leaked out and the alcohol concentration again builds up and there is no reduction.	11.574118322943
Which metabolic pathway it will enter requires understanding of the reaction mechanism and individual rate constants.	11.621326828260363
So , for a given concentration if we increase molecular weight , the number of molecules goes down so as osmotic pressure.	7.859560897270222
Polymers can be classified as thermal behavior as well.	7.014316548366792
In case of bulk polymerization that melts when you are talking about no solvent , only the monomer molecules , it becomes very difficult.	8.488639471609154
You have to increase.	7.490978431652463
Till now what we have been learning for last several lectures is how to synthesize different polymers , how to make different polymers , we have learnt different types of polymerization by which we can make polymers.	12.283832207009688
Obviously , the less the soluble , the monomer is in the aqueous medium they will try to partition more inside the micelles.	9.586819919409068
If some residue on solvents present in the polymer matrix , then what happened.	8.196476211924477
Now a special case , where r 1 and r 2 is 1, what happen again.	7.659675733943473
And because the concentration in those monomer droplets , the concentration of monomer in those monomer droplets is high , similar to bulk polymerization , so the rate of polymerization as well as molecular weights is also high.	10.89692945776207
Secondly , which is almost the majority of the application of polymeric material or polymers is where the polymer is the main component.	12.153126222305051
So , you know increasingly people are trying to avoid this root simply to avoid this use of large amount of organic solvent , which are not environmentally friendly.	10.055709128656883
But if the reaction can be carried out at a ph in the bulk which is lower , the side reactions can be totally overcome.	10.676776746619455
Because for example , if you talk about a building construction material , where the polymer used must be a fire retardants should not catch or ignite fire easily or if in case unfortunately , it is giving ignitable , it should not produced toxic gas or a smoke.	11.003201083922434
It could be graft , graft block copolymer where basically one chain all form m 1 and with side chain of m 2 it could have brass arrangement where basically , where project into two - dimensional where you have surface of a , and the brasses are hanging of the other monomers.	10.968356604155789
Let us see some example , generic example.	8.240392456199002
In the case of saturation kinetics or hyperbolic kinetics the ratio of the concentration of substrates for the two levels to reach will be almost about twenty seven times.	8.907836339061992
Otherwise most of the enzyme will exhibit stereochemical specificity and if there is an asymmetric carbon atom it will only accept one of the isomers and not the other.	11.634716214355961
So whether ability is basically noting , but the retention of property , of a particular polymer after it has gone through , or it has stayed outdoor , whether for some amount of time.	10.53033384037975
Now remember while discussing the radius of gyration , we discussed that radius of gyration is almost like the radius of that sphere.	10.725168507706238
So i can write , let me write in a separate page.	8.95194342422245
As i mentioned you will always assume a mechanistic hypothesis to arrive at rate expression.	8.103191494480468
Now , what we will first consider , we now want to find out this values , or these values , now if we can find one of them , we know that both these are related mathematically.	10.01918007089333
Now , you can have them in trans arrangement or a cis - trans arrangement as well.	7.068943461698237
Having understood the chemical and functional nature of enzymes , we will now move on to the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions.	8.00084972649161
Then many of these can be used for modification of enzyme specificity as far as the reaction is concerned in the organic medium.	9.60155874344517
We have chosen one molar here.	8.39295229596885
So , conversion is 50 percent and what is the degree of polymerization is 2, degree of polymerization is the number of structural unit present in the polymer chain or polymer molecule.	8.087713103344822
Sorry , so this will be much higher.	12.245872939607995
And also enzyme is very stable because it is experiencing the aqueous environment.	10.32970023408177
If you recall what we did in the case of the inhibition patterns , we took the double reciprocal plots and then took slopes and intercept and made secondary plot.	8.90951749840814
So , you need to take out the polymerization by precipitation for example , in poly carbonate case the poly carbonate are solvable in the methylene chloride phase.	8.873287167959036
So , the high molecular weights blends or the polymer mixing is not entropy is given so , it is basically the entropy of mixing what determines , either two polymer will be misicible or not.	8.256461862988466
So if your k and a are not known , you need to have five different molecular weight of that solution where the molecular weights are known by other absolute techniques and the samples should be such that they are very narrowly dispersed.	10.084935066770445
Here at this stage a modified enzyme complex and product x will be released with k2, k3b and you get e b.	10.776544900562845
If they are present alternatively , then we call alternating copolymer.	9.047970796299065
If you consider a glucose isomerase it is a xylose isomerase.	9.589069044648854
In that case the temperature has to be lower than the theta temperature to have the mixing possible.	6.80813667840341
So , how the stabilization is done.	6.676895607927202
Then you have initial substrate concentration; another parameter which we have to define in any problem of a immobilized enzyme or soluble enzyme reactor we first define the s0, the batch time or the reactor space time in continuous reactors.	9.782946644206119
Then the second parameter which is affected by the temperature is the energy of activation.	6.85865520467159
You can also take the conservation equation of substrate which will be equal to the substrate concentration plus product concentration.	9.132486042210383
This happens , because if the size grows safe if you have a polymer molecule like this and this is in the solution.	11.264797598260829
For example vanadium pentoxide or colloidal platinum can act as oxidation catalyst for n number of reactions or raney nickel for hydrogenation.	10.636985062497047
Even though the amount of the additives used are less , but because of their higher cost compared to the base resin , the cost of the polymer formulation would be higher.	11.37046415017806
See always you want a polymer somewhere; above the entanglement molecular weight , and just above the molecular weight , so there it can be processed easily.	11.374245705258025
So , monomer will be supplied from the bulk via or monomer will be supplied again inside the micellar core and to maintain the equilibrium , this monomer droplet will supply the monomer in the solution , are you clear.	9.62455097559949
And other fuller in spherical fullerenes and others also used as a nano - fillers.	10.895052267550192
So , we can easily remove the monomer molecules , which we can discuss the monomer molecules and we can only count the polymer chains.	8.939833442568128
Although it is listed as second it has become commercially a very , very important sector of analytical tool.	10.697040737575469
So , i can add , say , i can add here.	8.070115254401484
We will not use this as a catalyst or a coinitiator because rather than other complication if the reaction , it is too fast , then the side reactions also come in the picture , the side reaction also increases.	11.344583936958287
And we also know , that chain step polymers actually is equilibrium polymerization , where the reaction is slow and different tapes are different sizes of polymer or polymers are in equilibrium.	9.701491367028058
It is not practically possible to get purely hundred percent crystalline polymer , because of your size is mainly because of size or large molecular weight.	9.017281842650254
Light scattering as we know when electromagnetic radiation interacts with a molecule or a particle , it induces a dipole in the samples and the magnitude of the dipole will depend on how the charge can be separated.	10.964162743762595
It will always happen that it will have residues like for an example these r s which are also ionisable and the system might become a little more complex.	9.707536637462228
Now , let us discuss few examples , now this is a nmr spectra , proton nmr spectra form pmma , this is one example , one pmma not every pmma in the lab or plant should look like this; but it is one example , one pmma made in the lab , this is the proton spectra of that particular pmma sample.	9.746913554259363
Particularly , more importantly for resolution of racemic mixtures which we know that the enzymes are able to recognize one of the isomers the resolution can be carried out in the case of chemically synthesized racemic mixture.	10.631118151959512
Therefore we have three distinct approaches to monitor by experimental methods the effect of diffusional limitation in the case of immobilized enzyme particles.	10.507407434068092
So , you can have reactions happening in both the , propagation happening in both the sides.	6.595522217268223
As i said , all these are , these ion - pair aggregation are in equilibrium , they are always a very fast equilibrium , equilibrium exists between these two , say solvent separated ion - pair.	9.428507119691629
Now , in this particular case , forming polyamides you can make this from diamine and diacids.	9.276162191602257
Then you have the last configuration in which enzyme is modified by chemical modification so as to be made soluble in the non - aqueous phase.	8.716597129060911
In this case , on photo , these molecules can absorb photon and go to a higher excited state , which can actually dissociated , dissociate to form a couple of radical.	9.075585820404083
So , they make this pdms form small domains of pdms , in the entire matrix , which is mostly bpa polycarbonate , we are talking the composition , where it is mostly bpa polycarbonate , and may be 5 percentage pdms.	10.410319188741752
So far we have seen the structure and function of enzymes as they are available in the living cells.	8.014560276502014
With that view i think we would like to look at the other bisubstrate reactions subsequently and we will stop at this point.	8.264756373395436
We have also seen that is important , that we have the functional groups present in the.	9.511134452724894
So , the crystallization size , the crystallites , the crystalline dimension of the shape of the crystalline regions , as well as the fraction of the inter material which are crystallize; they all depends on several factors.	8.808888183559569
Ultimately you end up with the polymer of different monomers.	9.722531149137973
Same thing is called with different names.	12.120060771897593
In today s class what we will do , is to go through the other properties , like optical properties , electrical properties , barrier properties , and environmental properties , surface properties.	9.243722725681293
According to a organic chemistry definition , this is addition reaction.	14.069779333862664
So , half of the dyads will be in racimic form.	9.411129270117044
Similarly here also you can have a product formation to p + e.	9.072534485067967
Same thing here , but much lower , the picture is after much lower duration , at 80 degree centigrade.	9.220888707633694
If the size goes , this equation is valid for isotropic scatterer which basically have dimension radius less than lambda dash by 20; lambda dash is the wavelength of the incident light in the solvent.	8.349771694133294
So in this case we have seen , from earlier case as well , and earlier discussion as well , that at very low conversion itself , molecular weight obtained is high , and there is the time progress , more and more number polymer chains form , and , but the molecular weight remains more or less similar , which is very high.	9.813782092593977
Now , there is always an associated equilibrium value of the monomer.	6.746607992853467
You will all agree that it is very difficult to look at the living cell or a microbial cell which will not have more than one enzyme and which will use glucose as substrate.	9.896673127441144
The answer is no because it is not only determining by determined by thermodynamic feasibility , there has to be kinetic path way through which you can carry out the polymerization.	8.898507935076712
So , i write , initiator rate there , and plus , all these steps.	7.772653369089715
I will try to give the most common application of these polymers , but this and for this and for the coming polymers and there are trade names , where you by it this name , these polymers get sold in the market.	10.330334782475713
Now , this stabilization could be due to resonance in the active effect or hyper conjugation or even by inter - monomer association or inter - polymer association and if the polymer is strained , then also this goes up , del h comes down.	8.764903714265532
And the values are similar to the step growth polymerization values.	9.111686749767633
Now the steps which m 1 is , m 1 star is getting consumed , for in the reaction one , where 1 m 1 star is consuming , getting consumed , and 1 m 1 star is forming , so they are not changing the concentration on m 1 star.	9.759680611867374
So all these systems will be considered in the format of immobilized enzyme preparation and the enzyme preparation may be in the coupled form in the insoluble matrix , it could be entrapped into a semi permeable cell or entrapped in the gel because gel also provides you a porous network in which the enzyme can be entrapped and they will not be allowed to pass out through the gel pores because of the size limitation once they are entrapped and a similar thing applies to a ultra filtration reaction.	10.421159937163223
You need to place or you need to measurements at very low theta typically less than 2 degree.	10.28602621126253
See since we have already i; i is the number of polymers already added.	10.746404595587281
Now , as you can think that when a polymer molecule goes inside the pores the conformational entropy of the polymer chain get reduced , because the sum of the conformations which requires the central mass to be very closer to the rigid walls of this pores are forbidden which means the conformational entropy of the polymer molecules reduced or get decreased when a polymer molecule goes inside the pores.	9.09079308142472
So , to build a x n of 100, the phenol concentration should be of 5.05 into 10 to the power minus 4 mol per liter to understand because the equilibrium consent of this reaction is roughly one to build a molecular having a degrees of polymers of 10.	9.343564595955737
Now , you have to maintain moisture free environment and if you , and if you are actually using h 2 as a cocatalyst , then we should add h 2 o in the symmetric amount with respect to the catalyst because moisture or h 2 is present in excess than what you desired as a cocatalyst.	10.615541389596062
So , you can assume that all the aromatic protons peaks are from this 5 styrenic munities , whereas , this particular peaks are from the 3 hydrogen s from tertiary butylacrolate munity , and for styrenic munity.	9.485230557324007
Typically , the activity of the catalyst is measured as a k g; k g of polymer produced per gram of catalyst in an hour or completely or at the end of the or at end of the your or for a complete polymerization.	9.529194528293512
Now , what about this , in a non solvent what about this , the polymer solvent interaction parameter becomes 0.5, but expansion factor you can now imagine or you can think cannot be less than 1, because it is the unperturbed dimension if you are talking about a single chain.	9.655851516900105
So , first let us discuss where either you have a radical or you have a cation , carbocation or a carbon anion where the counter ions are free; they are not tightly bound.	10.883665555468493
A unit of katal is much larger and one can interconvert.	12.934249052028905
Substrate is not entering here.	11.832198506315793
You change any of this change.	9.505188477333943
We just talked about plus r ln m e , how do you get the relations between t c and m e.	7.959811826338184
I will , in the next lecture , which we will be going to be the last lecture of this course.	8.75529421499282
Now , generally , e , activation energy for transfer is higher than the activation energy for the propagation , which means , with , with increase in temperature c s goes up , the value of c s goes up.	7.959262900148104
And then briefly talk about polymer blends and then go to the concluding remarks about this course.	8.276622541296884
So this , again this delta is the amount of energy , or the heat we have to supply to the sample , to keep the sample and the reference temperature same.	9.953693653454758
As far as kinetics is concerned , as we have seen for the soluble enzyme , the substrate concentration versus initial reaction velocity that means the effect of substrate concentration on initial reaction velocity was the major kinetic characterization of soluble enzyme which gives you information about km , vm and other kinetic parameters and normally by convention we represent the kinetic parameter for an immobilized enzyme or immobilized biocatalyst by k m and v m.	10.550991075334535
So , the value of del h for pore penetration must be .	7.247335616379193
Now , we almost completed our discussion on the mechanism aspect of the theoretical basis of step polymerization.	8.2069706492578
The concentration of substrate , being a small molecule usually is much , much larger compared to the enzyme concentration which is used as catalyst in very small concentration.	9.705203139610997
The last effect is due to ionization of substrate.	9.276685819074148
Here n is the number of binding sites per enzyme molecule and k is the hill s constant.	8.486999406262896
So , it depends upon both.	7.615409567820293
A very important scientific development has been in the computational science.	9.10405575807456
Bulk of the commercial application have been in the area of hydrolytic enzymes with the exception of glucose isomerase which is in the isomerase category.	9.33545327048544
For a given concentration would be higher if the size of the polymer goes up , so if you if you add same amount polymers of different molecular weight , in the same solvent at same temperature , then the polymer which have the hard molecular weight or higher size , it will have , the solution will have higher viscosity.	11.071564729475982
Now this loss of entropy is accounted for in the energy of activation.	5.604836300840546
So those are the things , one must consider before for a , before you apply or before you have a polymer product out in the market.	10.35307184564215
So , basically if the molecular are same then because of branches are presents the chain , the polymer chain will be much more compact , so the radius , hydro dynamically radius of the radius of gyration , or the viscosity will be lower compared to linear polymer chain having the same molecular weight.	8.934150967140157
Then you can you can built the moleculate if it is the transfer reaction is because the monomer then then there is no other alternative we have choose different monomer al together.	10.783373851915789
So , gloss will increase with the increasing refractive index , as i discussed that increasing refractive index , the amount of reflective light is higher , so obviously , gloss increases.	10.10726059504747
And if you just talk about linear polymers , what about first let us talk about del s now del s will be negative because the monomers are getting joined and making a linear , linear polymer.	9.429630406631647
Now , if you look at this sub nmr of this particular compound , this three proton peaks are for the 5 hydrometric hydrogen of the styrene , is so this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 this , they are 5 hydrogen , for this 5 hydrogen automatic.	9.48659855571992
You can write activation volume in case of pressure depending up on the value of this activation.	10.508725572169716
So , if you have some chain like this b with dead end here and again b with dead end here , then you are forming a chain which does not have a reactive group or either of the sides.	8.119383552874064
So , p d i is 2 plus p by .	7.684953854337438
So , if if this is , if the polymer is forming from by poly condensation or step growth polymers from one monomer then you can simply write prefix poly and put the monomer name after that s , that will gives you name.	10.935918436584837
If you plot qt / v verses c / c0 the slope will be - f1 / f2 minus and the intercept will be ln c / c.	8.89498909003182
So therefore even a decrease of the energy of activation by 5kcal mol - 1 can lead to an increase of the reaction rate by a factor of 4.5 x 10.	10.35188406637145
We assume a steady state , where; now , immediately after the reaction starts , the change in radical , total radical concentration becomes 0 with time; which means that , the radicals are consumed at the same rate , as they are getting produced.	10.232614148790637
So , this cancel out so we get these were this is a the measure of reactivity of monomer 1 and this is the measure of reactivity of monomer .	9.294354982576264
Now , what is the effect of solvent.	5.842854527390418
That means because in the case of first order reaction there will be an exponential consumption of substrate with time and therefore if one takes a real data of a particular plug flow reactor based on kinetic analysis and based on experimental value , this will be actually based on the experimental data.	10.05195437912711
Charpy test is is shown here schematically , you have sample , the sample is clamped both the sides and there is a notched in the other side and you hammer it and find out the energy require to break the material.	11.395547371308894
Similarly , silicon oxygen bond is a very flexible bond.	10.44835252351271
Tryads , where we are talking about the three center adjacent to each other; like in this case , you have a meso pair and another meso pair.	10.676395235226947
In fact a very large percentage , more than ninety percent of the enzyme will be distributed on the porous network within the particle.	9.899888727618315
The same applies to agarose which is also a polysaccharide and also can be converted into a gel by cooling and there are some other polymers including synthetic polymers which have been used by this mode into immobilized preparation.	9.839451863897288
Here , we are choosing to write p instead of p equilibrium because the two equilibriums have not been reached because we are taking out the system.	9.204790098619272
Higher is tortousity , lower the diffusion.	11.03751403433702
We are not considering anywhere that means even fluidized bed is not considered as an idealized reactor system.	8.206537302672675
That is one of the reasons that in the literature a large number of immobilized enzyme systems have been reported to be used in a plug flow reactor mode rather than a cstr mode unless there is the requirement of ph control or in some cases when you want to add another constituent at a later stage.	9.738233197177184
So , with with a use of this nanoclay , the base polymer it has improvement in modulus , tensile strength barrier and fire retardant property.	9.123596442882311
So , we want to discuss about other thermal behavior , with of all the polymer behavior with temperature.	7.920187930252598
These reversible inhibitors are often categorized into three major classes based on certain general features and some of the general features which are used to classify them are : one is pattern of binding of the inhibitor to either the enzyme molecule or the enzyme substrate complex or in another words it leads to specific mechanistic steps which are involved in the inhibitory effect.	9.648317966956341
Consider zero order regime.	9.565546602141481
At the interface the two monomers gets polymerized and the reaction gives you a polymer what we know as nylon.	11.3809905709722
So , in this case , the order of reactivity of the radical will be exactly reverse for what we just solved for the reactivity of monomers towards a single radical.	8.453467314614185
So , by which you can determine the conversion.	7.061312678228263
The rate increases to a maximum level and then stops at that and beyond that there will be no increase in the reaction rate.	8.909202050523986
For the same for the same concentration the increase in viscosity of a polymer solution , depends on the size of the suspension in the solution , the size more size higher the size , the higher is the viscosity as we discussed.	10.766875427572788
It could be tertiary amino group of lysine or end terminal amino acid groups or a variety of other groups that are available on the enzyme protein.	9.177718333088883
So , it has become very difficult.	6.093442886702853
So if we increase the number of micelles by increasing the surfactant concentration , you will increase a n p , and then you will increase the rate of polymerization , what is the molecular weight.	8.638573528854835
Now , these are the; this is , as you know , this is the structure of polyvinyl chloride , but along with the main chain , there could be some other units in the polymer back bone.	9.617447032173006
So , which means and in some cases these , these are not present isolately , they actually remain in equilibrium and equilibrium shifts depending upon the polarity of the medium.	7.884013917811765
If you are doing reaction in the solution then if you are concentration in the monomer in the solution is slower , then viscosity does in go up that much and because the polymers are forming in a solution the heat management is very good.	10.707662995973749
You can get different kinds of profile as far as the operational stability of the immobilized enzyme is concerned.	8.864233171792213
If you recall from all the rate expressions that we wrote for the different types of inhibition pattern i = v0 - vi / v0 for non - competitive inhibitors , if you substitute the rate expression for the inhibitor and uninhibited reaction for the non - competitive reactions the value of i will be i / ki + i which indicates that the degree of inhibition is independent of substrate concentration , unlike in the case of competitive inhibition where increasing substrate inhibition can significantly decrease the degree of inhibition.	9.67927323235128
So , that entire mixture is your polymer sample.	6.313628209254155
That means whatever loss of entropy is there in the binding process that is not to be provided in the energy of activation.	7.1813289373446425
Remember we discussed last class that , generally we can introduced a by cooling a molten polymer , or annealing a semi crystalline or amorphous polymer is specific temperature , and then is just keeping a amorphous semi crystalline polymer at a particular temperature for a long time.	10.42785575589992
Now , examples of before we come to examples let s talk about the mechanism part of how , what are the ways this ring opening polymerization done if we know this is ionic polymerization so , let s first talk about anionic r o p now the initiator is initiated by as i said same similar ionic initiators as in the case of linear chain anionic polymerization , like metal hydroxides alkoxides metal hydroxides or metal alkoxides or metal oxides etc.	10.589378294542442
Then for , for given polymer , for targeting same polymer molecular weight it can actually live with the small amount of , mono , more amount of condensate in the system if you have comparing into reaction having one , having higher equilibrium constant.	10.894729572054434
Now , we know that again from that expression.	6.329274335623976
We talk about continue our discussion on mechanical properties , and we come to a concept of viscoelasticity.	11.49043403101634
The inhibition patterns or inhibitors can be classified into two main classes.	10.801672664192811
So , it is it is essential that , the combination is chosen rightly so , no universal fr additives , performance varies with the final form of product.	8.389706837315952
L value greater than two f is approximately 1 /.	9.3847003996415
Now , remember the reaction.	4.814520474578247
So , the bulk extension coefficient , is consist of bulk scattering , and molecular absorption.	8.777751758677853
One of the most interesting features of enzyme specificity is their stereochemical specificity because when there is a single molecule the functional groups are different , active sites also may have different functional groups to bind them and the steps can be understood.	9.920311314225009
The energy required for transferring the enzyme substrate complex to activated state will be reduced by 2 kcals because 2 kcals have already been consumed in the distortion process at the binding site.	9.203159511257851
The second type is alternate copolymer where you have alternate , exactly alternate arrangement of this two monomer and third is block , block copolymer where you have a significant longer chain of say , m 1and a significantly longer chain of m .	11.235350619731637
If the binding sites even if they are more than one , if they are not interactive that means they are independent of each other and do not interfere in binding of each other , then michaelis menten kinetics will be valid.	10.168973650941403
That means substrate concentration is almost hundred fold or more than the km value.	8.007225053393624
So that , you must know that , all the mechanical properties depends on depend on the temperature of the experiment or the application and and the how fast the deformation is taking place , how how fast the load is applied.	9.736515348345932
So , if it does not crystallize at melting point and you keep on decreasing the temperature , what will happen.	7.7839256414264595
Normally we assay the enzyme concentration in the linear range.	10.171758930896612
So , the interaction will be between polymer and solvent , dilute solution will be interaction and polymer and solvent , now if there are if there are favorable interactions between the solvents and the polymer , compared to a solvent solvent interactions.	10.203272044277929
As we also saw in the last lecture where the catalytic function was studied , the catalytic functions of the enzymes are responsible for the role played by active site.	9.518477003725115
So , what we will do and if they are live , they will remain live at the end of the polymerization as well , if they can live all this time , which is quite a longer time compared to a termination reaction.	8.92815522698237
So , for all this case we need; we said that will determine the intrinsic viscosity.	7.960609763952625
Because , the temperature , we do normal 10 polymerization , this reverse , reverse reaction is insignificant.	10.52891838564006
Here and if i write this , so in this case , the m 1 now at this point , the copolymers and the feed compositions are same.	9.75951892276962
It is a dissolved oxygen electrode; simple one showing different components.	9.336677923074362
These three parameters or these three steps are the critical steps in study of any kinetic system and applies to also the enzyme kinetics.	9.690801337846052
I will just give you an example when this propagating steps could be little complicated and by hydride shift or shift and that is applicable for say , propene or one alkene , one alkenes , take example.	9.938276410266003
Now , recollect from our discussion from last time , that we had.	10.984247035711261
Which means that , a polymer having larger size , it will be , which will give less entropy of mixing compared to a polymer having a lower size for a given solvent in given condition.	11.37195181291588
Just to repeat , we should consider two different cases.	9.109037015206221
What we now start is chain copolymerization , so let us start our discussion on chain copolymerization.	7.057384172113057
In the case of intercept the slope will be kb / vm and intercept of 1 / vm.	6.890812621533522
That means they have a electron positive electron rich double bond.	7.141521438978345
And these are all chlorine atoms , which are firmly embedded in the crystal of titanium alpha titanium chloride , again which we are writing the polymer residue here; p as a polymer residue.	11.294697548851046
That means , if you do not see any change in the concentration of monomer , which means , that no polymerization is taking place.	7.232690623723251
And the advantage is that at the end of the reaction , you can isolate the metallocene catalyst and then purify and reuse.	7.968132850219871
That means the preparation is highly reactive , the rate of reaction can be very high and the rate of diffusion is slow either because of the . . . of the substrate or the chemical nature of the matrix.	7.840442791208884
But in majority you know the major volume of polymer comes out in from the manufacturing plants , goes in the application where polymer is the major part you know , is a application of polymers is major.	11.445148567347978
I can write , similarly , d m m square is t.	9.3887164441752
They can get terminated reacting with the same molecule , and by coupling reaction they can.	10.648756616517659
So , from this calibration curve we can easily convert this elution volume to log molecular weight data.	7.980855421073534
So , if you use a calibration curve which is constructed for polymer a and use the same calibration curve for polymer b then these error will be erratic; that is what we are explaining till now.	8.54311393564286
It should be addition polymers , not a condensation polymers , but you can itself justify it being a condensation polymers , rather than a addition polymer.	9.344295503147658
So , for having any many useful information about this from this x - ray neutron scattering , the scatterer must be very small and what you need to do.	8.910200679081758
And there are other additives can be discussed but due to lake of time , we cannot discuss the entire list of additives used for polymeric material , what i did i did discussed the important additives , which are very commonly used in polymer industries.	10.146607108499559
If the polymer is insoluble and precipitate out once it forms and once it precipitate outs it can form powder or granular.	10.094870110110437
I am just describing the right hand side one.	8.483994387696825
For designing the whole commercial process they looked at two major parameters effectively although we have much better strategy and understanding of the various design parameters for the immobilized enzyme reactor but in the process two more parameters were considered; the effect of space velocity on the concentration of amino acid in effluent.	11.67474770331203
So , if i plot , say , energy and this , your monomer and this is your polymer , so this difference is your del h.	9.478799985052353
Now , in case of step polymers , like we talked about pet , polyethylene teritarate , we have teritaric acid , so i have t a plus , ethylene , ethylene glycol plus , the dyol ethylene , dyol i write d a.	9.27549246787911
If you introduced a flexible group in the back bone , then flexibility goes up , so delta s goes up , so your t m goes down so it comes around 12.	10.013971087906013
The third and another important feature was that he said that when we talk of rate of reaction we must talk only of initial rate of reaction , vo.	10.326984319597498
That means as the fractional conversion increases , the relative quantity required also increases and towards the final stages of the fractional conversion , the quantity very significantly goes up.	8.588343310148387
Quantitably this cohesive energy density is defined by this which is delta e v is molar energy of vaporization , it can be written by this expression also where delta h v sub v is molar energy of enthalpy of vaporization , this is molar energy of vaporization and this is molar enthalpy of vaporization v is the molar volume of the substance.	11.451464750038046
If a , a f is 2, physical a and a , it will be , it will be much narrow distribution.	10.656950296327883
This method is not very capable of measuring the number average molecular weight for very high molecular weight.	8.791732337138065
So , when polymer samples is injected in to this column then the solvent takes away or carries this polymer molecules to the detector and this pores which are in the column are responsible for the separation it brings about.	9.36532399355628
So , relative rates at which m 2 and m 1 is getting incorporated in the chain , copolymer chain is independent of which is present at the end , and the addition of , or incorporation m 2 in the copolymer chain is unbiased; that means , whether m 2 will get added next m 2 star , or m 1 star , are statistically same.	9.111651247831063
That means at the tip of the transducer you have a ptfe membrane so that the sample in which the analysis has to be done for dissolved oxygen is separated from kcl solution because that should not get mixed and a potential of about 0.5 to 0.8 volts , a constant value , is applied because this constant voltage applied will determine the calibration of the current which is generated as a result of dissolved oxygen when it comes in contact with the electrode.	10.203989836921357
Both the content and the sequence will vary from enzyme to enzyme.	8.3589446218577
These are cotton placed in the container below.	10.750906480459617
You can see that all of them are polar in nature and these are the usual amino acids which constitute the primary functional groups on the active sites.	8.318048545863698
If you consider nickel as the catalyst all the hydrogenation reactions can be catalyzed by that.	8.12328460115272
We know the transducer to utilize the selective analysis of a biochemical species in a sample.	8.823563022339746
A profile like this shows maximum value over a ph range , not a very broad range but at least in one or two units.	10.521295434136235
If there are something happen , some exothermic and endothermic reaction going on , so if there is some exothermic in exothermic transition or reaction happened here , then to maintain the temperature , the system has to supply more energy from outside , to maintain the temperature.	9.002976116445492
In case of these cases , you have a drift in the composition as you increase the conversion or as the reaction progresses with time.	9.468355805386533
However , plastics are still not as good as barrier materials like , glass and metals.	9.857584507608092
If you have a distribution , broader distribution or a narrower distribution , then the property is going to change.	9.424389232483309
They are very complicated.	9.747070444830982
Now , how can you do that.	5.828337039746544
That means we take an adsorbent , along with adsorbent or after adsorption is over we add gluteraldehyde to it and ensure crosslinking of the enzymes that are adsorbed in the matrix and the crosslinked preparation then provides you a good immobilized matrix for use in the reactors.	9.555660521705791
And if the obtained signal ratio is different from any of the values , it will be suppose to for a statistical random copolymer , then we will know that block is there in the polymer.	9.175525645704047
This dpi is blue and this is colourless.	14.31813174280804
Although they never said that the ternary complex formation doesn t take place , they agreed that ternary complex formation is taking place but the half life of the ternary complex is very small and before that the second substrate can interact with the ea to form the first product.	9.76153148089108
So , for a open driven system with incomplete removal of the condensate k , again co concentration h 2 o coh.	9.761406564964343
Now if you have.	8.006375896337426
When i am saying l - acyl amino acid this r could be anything the whole range of amino acids specifically in most cases depending on the amino acids there is a corresponding amino acylase.	11.18744447723573
Another way of this polymers; the zeigler - natta polymers get terminated which chain transferred to the group one to three metal alkyl metal like aluminum alkyl , we just discussed.	9.189961738766714
You do not need any calibration.	6.5547287941513845
So , this can be written as let me write once again.	7.01619334853396
And hence the effect of , it affects the glass transition temperature , and will also effects the melting point.	9.347323272158409
So , you just prefix this term poly followed by the monomer term and you name this as a polystyrene.	9.398877646537203
So , what i will do , i will discuss this techniques important techniques like compounding , injection molding , blow molding , compression molding in very briefly.	7.742132878714706
If this proton goes out and if something , one of the protons goes out from there , then you get cch and that is possible , these are possible for other monomers where this is , these two types of double bond is a possibility.	12.421958635445558
Now , as we have been talking , that this anionic polymerization proceeds without termination , but that does not mean , that this anionic chain ends , leave forever , not there are some intrinsic self - termination steps possible , which are actually very slow and extremely slow.	9.628464535128929
If in any of these two factors , if r is somewhere here , then the matter what is a conversion level.	11.622175700215756
We will talk about kinetic factor in next class , in next lecture and then compare between what are the factors we should take care to reduce the cyclic formation as desire that this should have minimum amount of the cyclic in the polymer mixture , but as i said that we cannot have word cyclic formation.	9.144979705128668
So , basically you can get this r 1 and r 2 numbers from any standard literature and from there , you can compare this r 1 r 2 values and their product to get idea about how about the reactivities of the different monomers and the resulting copolymer.	8.984539915931718
Now if you look the data compare so let us talk about the data.	7.949307133050687
And in case of semi crystalline material , there is existence , coexistence in amorphous and crystalline region.	8.182824938424842
And one point of time , the mobility , the thermal energy of this polymer chains will not be sufficient to have any mobility , any long range mobility of the polymer chain.	9.417348111776626
Now , when you synthesized you get it in solution or in a bulk.	7.089946562433084
Again you can think of a similar mma type situation , where in this case the counter ion is actually giving a strong coordination between the this is monomer substituent and the incoming monomer forming this type of intermediates.	10.976011593586046
So , they are thermodynamically miscible , immiscible polymers blends were the individual polymers components are phase separated.	8.259654691067562
So , we need to calibrate the experiment with the known molecular weight polymer solutions to actually determine the number average molecular for the unknown samples.	8.420832348708746
You can take a dihalide and then , you can make tri block polymer as well and for a simple case , the pdi for this sort of reaction given by this.	10.432261170341658
And from this distribution the different molecular weight like number average molecular weight , weight average molecular weight and other molecules can be directly obtained.	9.345417461035018
Another way is to look at the inhibition pattern in a generalized way rather than specific cases.	9.364381059802723
So , i should write cationic chain polymerization.	5.4939543258235615
They did not make any further analysis based on mass transfer or anything else.	10.333170699479503
Mild reaction conditions means , again i will i have to repeat , under those conditions in which the enzyme does not lose its confirmation or the functional reactivity.	11.278995708563002
They are scattered because you have substrate concentration on both the axis and therefore you get a much better fit.	10.991688463388336
Just for example you consider a very practical case which has been studied extensively like catalyzed hydrolysis of esters and amides and if we look at reaction sequence which it follows today e + s es eac e + p this is k1, k - 1, k.	10.381513855513127
Now , before we come to this lectures topic , let us just recapitulate what we have learnt in last lecture.	8.008325701601086
For a given polymer sample in a solvent for a particular temperature how will you determine , how will you determine eta intrinsic viscosity.	9.611505555693654
On the other hand the reverse might be true in the case of plug flow reactor and so the incorporation of effect of substrate and product inhibition on the reactor performance equation becomes very important.	7.250943444929662
Km / s0 will be large and under that condition you must assume a first order kinetics and if the value of km / s0 decreases the error will continue to increase.	9.482781006105041
Bulk of the other industries has not made use of these biocatalysts at least up to the beginning of the last two decades.	11.064297572819456
The third case is , k the new rate of polymerization with the radical form due to transfer reaction is lower than k p but rate of transferring rate constant for transfer reaction is much lower than the rate constant for the original polymerization reaction.	9.469890579220845
This is an example not really of a metabolite or some kind of a substrate or the product but it was just like an environmental analysis where the presence of certain cholinesterase inhibitors present in either effluents or nearby as a result of pollution were monitored continuously using an immobilized cholinesterase entrapped in a starch matrix plus a fluorescence spectrophotometer because the product ultimately gives a fluorescence and the change in fluorescence as a result of inhibitor present.	9.618524587513903
Now , how do you do that.	4.878096407192625
The control of the enzyme reactors is rather difficult in the case of soluble enzyme batch processes or even immobilized enzyme batch processes and the control is much more effective in the case of a continuous flow reactor using immobilized enzyme.	10.034861542694994
Now , let us recap the lecture we had in the last time lecture 18, where we talked about the cationic chain polymerization of kinetic and energetics and we started our discussion on anionic chain polymerization and we talked about general features of ionic chain , anionic chain polymerization and different types of propagation , initiation , mechanisms , propagation and we just studied a few examples by which anionic chain polymerization can be terminated.	9.362118626782182
I just taken out 2 student , added 2, 10 years; and , taken out another 2 student of 25 years , added 40 years.	10.095711693055085
They don t influence the binding to other site.	10.949774192096648
In the cstr , the concentration of the enzyme which you can . . . usually is not very high when compared to the pfr.	11.690607688638043
Similarly , the chances of this type of carbonate linkage is given by again 0.25, if i have fifty - fifty ratio in the feed.	6.398031845316694
For examples polymers are used in medicine , as a drug delivery vehicle , as a conservation with drugs , molecules and so many.	11.490312669558888
This region , the so called active site may constitute less than 5 % of the total surface area present on the enzyme protein.	9.280743826005939
So , if you want to compare whether ability of different polymer , you must have a standard conditions , which is very difficult reproduce , and you must compare a conditions , depending upon , or looking at the final application.	9.341207195773444
This ess is a dead end complex.	8.034722953349018
K2 is the turn over number and if the catalyst is slow then also the diffusional limitations will be negligible.	10.969801176111142
But if you think , to increase the temperature at some temperature the rate of depolymerization will also be insignificant , in those cases we have to consider the rate of depolymerization also.	11.326890608672283
Look at the refractive indices of this two , pc is 1.58, and pdms is 1.4, so; obviously , there is a mismatching in refractive index , so they will scatter a light.	9.779368061854056
The first binding site is occupied , the second binding site is free and depending on substrate concentration it can bind and form a binary complex where the two substrate molecules are bind that means both the binding sites.	9.324012044991157
Ligases join two molecules at the expense of energy source.	12.085217667611897
Today we will be discussing some of the characteristic features of enzymes particularly as proteins and their chemical nature.	8.007033223017729
Now , what we will do it.	5.5000696481410865
So , for example , if you compare maleic anhydride and styrene , individual individual r 1 and r 2, they are very close to .	6.911420667545553
If you consider even from energetic point of view let us say the binding process of these three residues requires 5 kcalmol - 1 for example and in the distortion process let us say already 2 kcal have been spent hypothetically.	11.27279328566807
If you look at the c curve which is very commonly used for analysis of packed bed reactor , in the case of a c curve on the basis of the flow pattern the mean concentration of the substrate in the exit stream will be equal to the sum of all this elements of the exit stream for concentration of substrate remaining in an element of age t + dt into the fraction of exit stream which is of age t + dt.	8.476532539873237
That means either when the substrate concentration is much , much smaller than km or when it is much higher than km.	6.762381355427162
And after a certain molecular weight , the chain , hence do not contribute too much.	10.290675124433287
If you make a comparison between the international unit and katal , katal is a very large unit and one katal could correspond to 106 x 60 international units because convert moles into macro moles and minutes into seconds.	9.713148525066977
The other models it can form; just like i was explaining it can form folded chains and align themselves to form high crystalline material.	9.584130748184204
Now , these two polymers condensation and addition polymers , they are often used synonymously with chain growth and step - growth polymers because most of the condensation polymers are synthesized by chain growth polymer mechanism , and addition polymers are made through a chain polymerization mechanism , but this is not always the case.	9.311115764379688
And in this case , the vacant d - orbital present in the transition metal in the main source of catalytic activity and as we said and as i said , that insertion happens in between the titanium and carbon bond.	7.615368057222229
Only when the concentration of this phosporylated glucose becomes quiet high , a part of it , depending upon the ratio of the km value will go to glycogen synthesis.	10.060989322016988
This is a heater , and you have sample , and again you have a reference , you have a thermo - couple for the sample , a thermo - couple for the reference.	9.835268968652601
So , from this two , we can get as the samples elute; we can get the molecular weight data in real time and from ri detection detector we can get the wet fraction automatically.	10.064560268992961
Because , they very fast reaction once the product is formed the byproduct hcl is getting neutralized with sodium hydroxide , which means there is one reaction is formed.	9.459331261876404
Similarly we have systems like hollow fiber reactor , as we discussed earlier , in which case the enzyme is entrapped in one of the side of the tubes and substrate is passed from the other side and the two sides are permeable that means they are separated by semi - permeable membrane and the reaction can take place and the product stream can go.	10.372671419185117
Now , let us put this number for the same , same monomers , the t c values.	8.463509568027378
Now , in this crystal as i said , this is a octahedrally coordinated.	9.898275314090492
In the case of immobilized enzyme systems which have no diffusional limitations the rate of reaction is proportional to enzyme loading and which is the usual understanding even for soluble enzyme.	7.8712747989726735
Now , this is can be easy stabilized by all this roaming molecular , which can participation the reguise instructed.	9.990428021040247
How the weight fraction distribution varies with molecular weight.	8.51115089614084
Now , remember the discussion we had for radical , this polymerization , radical chain polymerization , where the initiation steps is much slower compared to propagation step , but in this case , this anionic polymerization , the initiation steps are much much faster compared to propagation steps.	8.652705307029894
I again like to remind you that just as a matter of convenience we consider only those steps which lead to the synthesis of ea.	10.678952780591004
That information must be known and the kinetic characterization will imply that the km and vm values for an immobilized enzyme preparation might undergo change during immobilization.	9.510215593074625
This is a racimic pair , this is also another racimic pair; so gives you r r.	9.77985765166186
You make this small volumes of bulk polymers distributed in a or dispersed in a aqueous solution.	9.268152872652957
But in general the action of enzymes on a reaction involving two substrates a and b giving rise to products x and y is expressed here.	9.762666205487138
In case of polymers , this solid state is not actually a proper.	9.088657467792084
Viscosity is depend upon m v , viscosity average molecular weight.	8.402568539924102
Under that condition at in the case of cstr you can develop the reactor performance equation for such system also on the same lines as we did for michaelis menten kinetics.	9.183529090860507
So , any change in these t g values are because of the most likely because of the interaction between the intermolecular forces between the two chains.	10.581400840369573
Or s0.5 substrate concentration for 50 % maximum reaction velocity is nvk.	11.973765418022047
So , if there are anti - stat additives were not used during the normal usage of the plastic material , the static can static charge can generate on the surface , which might give lot of hazard to the user.	9.529654975131516
We can give more example of back bone stiffness.	9.273476953667311
Now , this can be justified , if you think little more.	9.439160956130015
So , what , so we can write , that k i is much higher than k p , rate constant for the polymerization and rate of polymerization , which is again the standard way of writing k p.	8.73724629832593
This is coinitiator , coinitiator , bf 3 or alcl 3 are , sometimes they are called this bf 3 or alcl 3, called catalyst and this initiator called cocatalyst.	9.618455464570442
So , here , the molecular weight , on termination the molecular weight does not change , ignoring the difference of 2 hydrogen here , between this two.	9.834502751684916
Now we will further treat this expression and see whether we can arrive at an expression which can help us in determining the molecular weight by dilute solution viscometry.	9.214958299360841
So , if i plot that f 1 where m 1 is styrene.	6.756205641459743
But in most cases the salt concentration is required to be kept at a minimum because salts are very good eluents also.	8.262890181257285
One of the most commonly used methods is the poly acrylamide gel entrapment.	6.234553583705026
Today the process is used industrially , commercially almost in half of the world wherever sucrose is not abundantly available , as a sweetener for glucose fructose mixture because the product cost is not very high.	9.76646208950988
So that s why the graph is in the form of conversion.	8.352371977657759
So , a material if it look at through material , which has lower clarity , then you will low resolution of the object will come down.	8.936965527684357
So these are some of the practical implications of the significance of michaelis menten kinetics which applies to most of the kinetic analysis.	8.168113996176203
If the average molecular of the structural units is 200, then the molecular weight will be above 10,00.	10.861850072197361
So , the higher whether ability means , it has , it will retain , the polymer retained the properties for a longer period of time , in that given weather condition.	10.705157503791083
So , if you put e d is 0 and e t , e t term values from same as earlier , you will get e r is 20 kilo joule per mol.	7.77829453983918
Now , if you compare the monomers having electron withdrawing groups like m m a and acrylonitrle , the reactivity comes down compared to styrene because they cannot stabilize as much as styrene can do a propagating radical.	8.25153091871843
The structure is mentioned in the bottom.	12.596322921747593
Now , we know that n is the number of molecules present.	5.510087626002955
Instead 15 kcalmol - 1 involved in binding of the normal molecule for the three bonds , you will require only thirteen.	12.875470052792725
Therefore as the substrate concentration gradient developed in the particle the concentration drops and the reaction rate can be higher than at the surface and therefore the effectiveness factor can be more than one.	8.607395185662844
Because the binding has to take place and the binding process requires a strain onto the substrate molecule so that it comes in proximity of the catalytic sites.	8.307780401506186
We can clearly see.	10.26076149263088
So , there is only one way you can place all the solvent molecules; if you change the places between the solvent molecules themselves , it does not given any indistinguishable arrangement.	8.524768901283602
In that case diffusion effectively will not play a key role in the reactor design and the reactor design can be easily taken care by idealized reactor performance considering the reaction kinetics in picture.	10.515952870365092
So , in maldi , choosing of matrix is very critical and it needs to optimize for every polymer samples.	8.359899370123275
As a result , slowly with combustion , the concentration of mole fraction of m 1 monomer in the chain in the reaction medium would be going to .	9.110791260978605
Now , n 0 was the number of molecules , or monomers at the beginning.	7.287479789644332
Now what happens when a light travels through a matter.	8.983915189214807
Just to illustrate one of the reaction system which we did some work here in iit itself and the enzyme reactors systems were developed here and used for a number of reactions which i have skipped.	12.535988371151126
And , there 2 path ways by which bpa poly carbonate , discriminate polycarbonate undergo photooxidation.	9.646034349216444
Because , this number is much higher compared to the number of primary radicals , for example the radical concentration typically at the beginning is r dot , beginning is 10 to the power 16 liter inverse , whereas we know that concentration of micelle around 10 to power 21; so it is basically 10 to the power of 5 times number of micelles.	10.668023778046589
Now if you do the reaction at the temperature which is below t g now t g for polymethyl methyl acrylate is little excess then 100 is close to 10.	10.531212658635342
So , your properties what you targeted will be different.	6.806834068574922
We will continue this step growth polymerization in the next lecture.	6.102665314898464
So the monomer , incoming monomer can add to the chain from only single side.	9.941348867651389
So , you form these trimers.	8.241631303315517
This was for thermal initiation processes.	8.919218644025502
Now , these are the some of the numbers of different r 1, r 2, r and their product as well.	7.9484233837862845
Of the total feed stream f1 has come into the reactor and 1 - f1 has gone untouched from the reactor.	9.011054099002147
There is number of fraction.	9.148947541219805
This is time and f is c / c.	9.365160198233877
So , this gives you idea about a different stages of polymers and how the industry work.	7.863004224938363
So , processing good processing is always favored by low molecular weight.	7.860812113961374
Based on the operational data that means the concentration of substrate in the feed and the product stream as well as the parameters of the reactor operation and the particle size , one can determine the length of the reactor required and if this length of the reactor required is relative to the length of the reactor required for biochemical reaction , if you compare this height required , let us say this is z1 to that of the height required z2 based on biochemical reaction if you calculate idealized reactor performance equation and calculate the height of the reactor required and compare the two values that gives you an identification whether film diffusion is controlling or not.	9.920179960034679
Now , once this concentration goes up what happen to the rate if this goes up rates goes up rates goes up now we know del h is negative exothermic reaction , once rate goes up goes up more and more heat involved and more heat involved means will know in a minute that of if we increase the temperature the medium rate of polymerization even goes up.	9.265157379354147
For a amorphous polymer , if we heat from a lower temperature region , the volume expand at the constant rate.	11.0379605841065
As you can understand that crystalline regions , semi - crystalline polymers will have crystalline regions of high stiff regions which basically gives you higher rigidity , but lower impact strength; obviously , you can imagine from the structure that it will give higher density.	10.018735808405015
Now , say i take a monomer nh2, say rnah2 r dash coh co oh forming polyamides.	8.888835583334751
It also influences the deactivation of the enzyme molecule and finally a very important tool which it provides is to understand the thermodynamic status of the enzyme substrate interaction and one can by computing the value of km at different temperatures one can get a picture of the.	10.627663209473967
The resolution also depends on the length of the column , but not as much as the size diameter of the beads; it is depends on length l to the power half.	9.420877347958879
You need not disrupt the cells and then isolate and purify the enzyme and then immobilize.	11.190300936079984
So , we know all the basically what are the information needed for the polymer.	7.488178412811164
Now , out of this entire volume , 95 percent and more would have been useless without stabilization by adding external additives.	8.249437953518049
So under that condition there will be no diffusion control.	8.237467501212175
So if they is no change in heat capacity of the sample , then the value of the daily will remain same , which will give pass the base line.	10.376675867543815
So explanation , general explanation is little difficult to give.	11.35384734740517
The method was proposed by king and altmen way back in 195.	12.726166127422015
So , ticl 4 have more lewis acidity compared to , tl , ticl 3 than this.	8.27536394248656
So these are the two criteria s must be fulfilled , so to get a crystalline polymers.	7.930500647765577
So , this methods is typically applied for the polymers which have the high glass transition temperature like methyl methacrylate and all this things.	9.201677507033908
The reaction control in the case of soluble enzyme and the batch immobilized enzyme is usually difficult which makes it very easy in the case of a continuous flow immobilized enzyme reactor.	9.120074546139245
The particular amino acids to give the l - amino acid; it gets deacylated and you get l - amino acid and d form remains untouched.	10.834631284329124
This kind of a sequence is the observation which is followed.	11.140619080460139
We write the rate constant for all these steps in the cyclic form making them in the kind of a first order rate constant.	9.122982000965267
Michaelis menten constant is the substrate concentration at which reaction velocity is 50 % of that of the maximum reaction velocity.	10.346333810953624
In fact no method can ensure that you can recover the enzyme in hundred percent yield.	11.11367474988141
So , it is better if you want to make a glossy surface , then the surface should be smooth.	9.282865012106566
That could be because if we do the reaction in the solution and during the precipitation of the polymers , the monomer or the low molecular weight fractions remain in the solution.	9.735110843832222
While the conventional systems as we have seen use the packed bed and feed the substrate in either at the top of the column or at the bottom of the column either of the combination is feasible but they may also have some operational problems.	10.797989376356
We can write , this is your radius of gyration.	8.766686150158868
So , how we write the equilibrium constant in that case.	10.18976057744986
For example , if you are adding some additives for some medical application , then the additives should not come out and contaminate the medical devices.	8.573956122538833
Now , what if there was another polymer here , which is the case for real case , in real case there are many polymer chains , so if you imagine this is another polymer chain; now for self intersections or intra molecular long range steric interaction , self intersection is caused by the long range steric interactions.	9.250880844849483
Just to summarize first of all you write the reaction mechanism in a cyclic manner , write all the kappa values at each of the inter conversion arrows of the different enzyme species express the fraction of the concentration of a particular enzyme species of the total enzyme concentration in terms of the sum of the products of the kappa factors and then write the rate expression taking the value of the particular enzyme species from those expression.	10.31095042584526
It mainly useful for as we see it is mainly useful for non - polar solvents and non - polar amorphous polymers , it is not very useful for polar molecules and polar solvents.	11.527738354534575
The immobilization offers n number of advantages and one of the major advantages which we have already talked about in the definition itself is its reusability.	10.439719133227456
Is the frequency.	13.641548961335774
The increase in the rate of polymerization was much higher in case of polymerization initiated by a thermal initiator , then redox initiator and then photo chemical initiator.	10.806314701666471
I am again not writing the parenthesis but the capital letters denote the concentration terms.	9.593949572619117
That actually covers most of the volume of acrylic polymers and the poly methyl pm is actually synthesized by solution suspension or by emulsion polymerization.	11.334657391396577
Now this can be copolymerized by radical , it can be copolymerized by anionic , but it cannot be copolymerized by cationic.	10.333631939327175
So , the more the transfer reaction , obviously , the average degrees of polymerization comes down so as same , same discussion you can have what we had for the reaction , chain radical polymerization.	9.282562003980866
So , that reaction at the temperature will continue till the free monomer concentration reach to the equilibrium value of the free monomer concentration related to that temperature.	7.333139168130174
So , we can just remove the pressure terms from the bracket and we can write from the definition of mu pi we can write using the help of the partial differential.	10.337701502524137
In fact some times there are also called catalytic poisons because they irreversibly poison the catalyst.	8.401380744511341
So , welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry , and in this lecture today we are continuing our discussion which is left over from last lecture on frictional properties of polymer in dilute solution.	6.491820055743247
I was talking about the formation of sulphydryl bridge.	10.6037819840933
Similarly here the k is the boltzmann constant and t is absolute temperature.	6.811677380842037
That means with a partly substrate bound form and so therefore the final value of n will be in fraction.	9.999410815362706
Certain conditions apply but those conditions are by and large extreme conditions.	11.819225333948063
Of course , one of the basic size is contour length , contour length is basically n multiplied by l , n is the number of bonds and l is the , n is the number of bonds and l is the length of each bonds.	7.614162478517303
At a low ph the molecule will act like a cation and as we increase the ph it will be negatively charged and it will behave like anion and some where in between there will be a zero net charge that means it will have both positive and negative charge of equal magnitude , what we call as zwitterion in the case of amino acids.	10.37303387438548
If you look at the classical vant hoff equation for an equilibrium process , the equilibrium process here is km e + s es with the dissociation constant of km.	7.903775918329692
So far we have been talking assuming that the enzyme reactors are ideal in performance and they are following michaelis menten type of kinetics.	8.912553018443347
So , this intercept is nothing but pi by c at c is equal to .	6.787830520747362
Next , we want to discuss little bit in brief , the barrier and permeability of the polymers.	8.2262981204062
So , the monomer which is or the radicals which is least stabilized , they will have the highest reactivity towards a particular monomer.	7.919606373760447
For plastics are somehow in between this is fiber elastomers and this is plastic.	13.206788949300483
So , you have this now this will again react with another monomer in similar way.	7.291626691535557
Film diffusion or the pore diffusion.	12.062479509673588
When this first example of emulsion polymerization was done , which was emulsion polymerization was used to synthesize , used to synthesize a rubber , synthetic rubber or styrene and butadiene , which was first example of synthetic rubber.	10.480486619979613
So , you can just ignore this title for this moment and just concentrate on the mathematical part of this expression.	7.744902164967629
As the concentration of monomers comes down , the rate of cyclization will go up.	9.561791214213264
Bulk of the immobilization enzyme product will be in the form of carrier.	8.786743174448208
That means , how much excess we use , the term slight excess , so how much excess you should use for your target molecular weight or how much mono - functional monomer you should have for a target molecular weight.	9.237911851756813
So , the surface would be in contact with the mold , it will be plain which would not have any bubbles , it will be smooth but , the bulk will have lots of inner gases as a foam so , it will so , you get a foamy material.	10.479859067365242
In the case of a non - ideal system which incorporates a fraction of the feed stream which is directly channeled out into the exit stream and another fraction of the total volume of the reactor which is almost like a dead zone and does not participate in the reaction process.	8.649731625005003
This x w x n , which is the polydispersity index will land up 1 plus 1 f.	11.196122098571376
As a special case , where r 1 r 2 both are 0 is perfect alternate copolymer , where basically f 1, so as f 2 is 0..	9.491100906288516
An example could be cited of conversion of carboxylation of acetyl coenzyme a to melonyl coenzyme a.	9.686482046397584
Either the active centre on which next monomer is getting added and third monomer will be added in there.	10.651948874888088
That means you use a hydrophilic support and the hydrophilic support will contain the enzyme particle immobilized along with some water molecules dispersed around it and the whole particle is then immersed as shown in a magnified way here.	9.847548126685183
Now , in case of radical polymerization , in radical copolymerization , the reactivity does not depend too much on the reaction medium.	6.802028715988788
So , this type of ring opening polymers by structure you may confuse with this , with the step growth polymers , but actually from mechanism the way it is synthesized this is more close to a chain polymerization of this type than a step growth polymers where the polymers are formed step wise , dimer , trimer , tetramer and so on.	8.873999377024788
So , we will start stereo chemistry of polymers and polymerization process in our next lecture.	7.2472406238770875
One of the key parameter here is it has to be insoluble in reaction environment.	9.61489543020083
Now , you can imagine , now if you now go from n butane , to n pentane and then slowly increase the number of carbon atoms to make a polymer , to how how this potential energy will look like.	8.555714459894286
For an ideal reactor such kind of response is obtainable.	11.365419732479738
They also can catalyze a number of stereospecific chemical transformations that are otherwise difficult to carry out in a single step by other chemical routes and also a major advantage of mild operating conditions which make them very attractive industrial catalyst.	9.932921239968689
It will be more clear it is e , the enzyme in the modified form.	8.782421040515462
So , unless there is a specific mechanism in normal case , there will always be syndiotactic would be a preferred tacticity.	9.62440655741852
Third thing is that the effect of the competitive inhibitor can be successfully overcome to a significant extent if you increase the substrate concentration to a very large value as compared to inhibitor concentration.	10.898965284273446
Similarly in the case of alcohol , an alcohol dehydrogenase which also involves nad gives the corresponding aldehyde.	9.4132850211975
In true sense , solid states because in most cases , either it is fully amorphous , no long - range order is present and in second case they could be partly crystalline; partly , there could be long range order exists and partly there will be no order.	10.224558480607591
Under such conditions one can write the rate expression for a non - competitive inhibitor as s.	7.709201317679754
Now , let us consider a close system and take that we will write this reaction and reaction is constant.	7.380968896228432
Take another example where if you consider as a vinyl acetate.	10.768365244015255
Now , molecular weight you know is relative term that means is a , the weight of a molecule compared to divided by the weight of isotope c 12, for sometimes it also more correctly it mentioned as molar mass which is basically the mass of 1 mol of that molecule.	10.362932131511219
We now learned about the redox initiator.	9.363201987660894
So , accordingly , you will get drift in the copolymer composition as well.	8.538941958443557
So , if you write just polymer chain conformation like this and in and in real polymer , these are basically different chains are entangled with each other.	8.244662182061708
The crystalline polymeric material gives high heat capabilities because of the reinforcement made by the crystalline regions.	11.262856821470187
Plastics has also more , have more scientific definitions which we come later , but at at this point you must remember that plastics are made of polymers , but not all polymers are plastics like there are several other applications where polymers are not used as plastics.	10.419214984903729
There are two products formed on hydrolysis , acid as well as alcohol and this is your k.	12.442883106515545
Whereas in b p o , the case of thermal initiator , the reaction rate is much lower.	10.055410188123647
Or if there are intra molecular chain transfer reaction happen then there will be possibility of in this case.	11.662890724599551
Styrene has been assigned so arbitrarily a value of q is 1 and e is 1.0 and 0..	13.461000171448532
Foam of polymer polystyrene is found by impregnating and blowing agents , and we have seen yourself many applications of polystyrene founds like disposable drinking cups , the cushions , cushioned packaging and thermal insulator and sometimes , these cushions packaging like your labeled reagent bottles comes with some packing outside or some boxes made up of polyester in foams.	11.287139541018666
Now , this one example we can give , the normal , excuse me , normal hydroxyl acid , you know , normal ester formation , polyester formation from diacid plus diol to give polyester plus h 2 o.	8.959165605580063
Ideally it should come out in a very short period of time like we have put it here but it comes out in a broadened fashion.	10.966566015941355
If you reduce the particle size to the extent that the rate of diffusion is enough to counter or enough to take the substrate up to the interior of the particle.	6.897229938993951
Now , if you dissolve this polymer in water , what happened.	6.63298265413394
If you consider the first enzyme species let us say e we write down all the possible patterns which contain n - 1 terms where n is the number of enzyme species.	8.506757193971444
This substrate concentration corresponding to maximum reaction velocity is not really something which is corresponding to maximum reaction velocity of enzyme catalyzed reaction.	8.19920366837506
So , if you have t , there are t .	8.422368027482031
If it is first order rate constant , k2e0 / km in the case of immobilized enzyme catalyzed reaction then the value of e0 is increasing by enzyme loading and therefore as you increase the enzyme loading in this direction and some arbitrary values of let us say one , ten and hundred you notice that the effectiveness factor very sharply decreases.	10.032048217331335
When he added , then even at low temperature , say like low temperature means 50 to 100 degree centigrade and at low pressure , he got very high molecular weight polyethylene.	9.992426792292068
Next point is , no or minimum side reaction.	8.492451588304695
And this type of initiators , which are weakly , very weak nucleophiles , they can be utilized to initiate a very strongly or highly stabilized propagating anions , like cyanoacylate , acylate , because cyanoacylate has two stabilizing groups.	9.943462076160184
You can have polymers as geometric isomers like in this case cis - iso , poly - iso from all the monomers are arranged in a polymer in a cis arrangement.	9.909742630142462
So , you will get back the same expression.	6.154739139395517
They must be able to tolerate it and the enzyme must be available when you say yield i am referring to a term which incorporates the cost part; because higher the yield , the cost can be lower.	9.290321374236145
A very large range of application sectors in the therapy have been known with soluble enzymes.	8.99734207337266
The output becomes instead of vertically.	12.230020056072833
What do we expect in the system mixture.	10.498142032786903
We can compare between say one butyne and one tribu butyne.	10.256029642468718
So , give let us give some examples of this transfer reaction , when x a is initiator say , i have a reaction of acrylonitrile.	10.946324874083082
Segment density of the coil is lower; segment density is higher.	10.985375090687528
So , every real polymer chain will have restriction of bond angle and also restriction for the single rotation around the single bond.	7.7927224945545674
So , if i i have polyethylene oxide.	6.673753197446435
Then reaction capacity can be given by k2.e0 which is vm multiplied by the reactor volume and the voidage and then finally the important parameter is enzyme kinetics itself because the reactor performance will depend upon the reaction kinetics which controls the reaction.	10.35866769043811
So , like 3 by 2, some cases , experimentally it might , you might find out or some cases it might be even lower.	9.50338575457758
So , rate of polymerization reaction , propagation reaction is same as rate of depropagation reaction , if i want to show this in , in a figure , what we can , so if this is your rate.	10.588424590764507
L . if the.	9.963630289677836
If you look at the ph effects you will notice that the ph influences enzyme reaction rates or enzyme reaction in general in a number of ways.	8.391128409532845
That would be a better interpretation.	12.801414553403825
And what happened now.	9.424044429304036
We must know that some of the reactions are not independent.	10.581085276137152
You should not get threatened by the amount of cost of 106dollars.	12.266072447792364
So , you have this type of polymers are getting formed in a chain reaction.	7.413457969831072
So , drop the percentage , drop in m n because of presence of non - polymeric small molecules , the effect of m n will be more than m w so , m n will be dropping more compared to m w.	10.15529387875927
So , you should remember that though this addition and chain polymers are quite quite similar in terms of the structure and most of the chain polymers are made by addition reactions and most of the step polymers are synthesized by condensation reaction , but they are different they should not be used interchangeably.	9.350264564089295
The first and probably the most simplest reactors is the batch reactors.	6.333082422152297
If this becomes a constant parameter , at constant b you can write vm . a.b / ( kb + b ) v0 = ( k a . kb + ka . b ) / ( kb + b ) + a we have rearranged the general equation in the form of michaelis menten expression.	8.906926684936256
So , in this case , this two moles of chain which underwent disproportionation reaction , you have total number of , this has each one has one residues initiator residues and this has two initiator residues.	8.580800266237423
That means as soon as the substrate comes in the proximity of the enzyme active site , initial binding takes place.	6.978877522520087
What kinds of electrodes are used usually.	12.886351158812007
The major factor is that we will look for an enzyme preparation which has the high specific activity.	9.798818535960434
And we have not studied the processing part in detail but what i have done , i gave you the basic processing technique , which you must know to be understand the polymer completely.	10.212761360519684
Some cases this rubber gaskets are used for sealant in may be in aircraft applications , where a ceiling is very important.	10.563228586834272
So , this is given by , for this the model is developed and that is again , which is just mentioned is the expression for this chain is given by random walk model , which was first developed for the movement of ideal gas; but here the difference is that , in case of ideal gas , the steps , the gas molecules can take , this does not matter , you can take any value.	10.353621580345175
So , we can get an equation like this where r is delta r theta is as we said that the rayleigh ratio; this r for rayleigh ratio basically take cares of the intensity.	7.998752374777269
So , if we know we can basically get the information about light intensity from the voltage output.	8.36412627834196
That means as a result of the substrate concentration gradient that develops in the matrix phase to that of maximum reaction rate obtainable in the absence of any pore diffusional resistance.	8.521573698388721
For example if i have a monomer like this , propylene oxide and i make a polymer from this.	6.700570182713533
This and this often is understood , that t c is the single number , it actually depends on the monomer concentration as well.	10.169283980841055
So , these would be having tendency towards block copolymer formation.	7.853922343798171
We know , that for linear polymerization the infinite molecular happen only when everything is reactive , the , all the monomers are reactive forming a single chain.	8.672194791924717
So , it may have much lower hydrodynamic volume per coil.	7.849020134382975
And if your monomers , if your side reactions , which hinder the reactivity of a functional group , if you have some species , which is generating , which is affecting the reacting functional group , that also will hinder your , you know , reactivity of the functional group , hence the polymer formation.	11.54675854127722
Polyurethane can be synthesized from diol and di isocyanate.	11.145224641600832
So , in this case the polymer molecular weight will be degree of polymerization multiplied by the average of these two monomers minus the water molecules which have been eliminated , i will show you a example , real example in coming pages.	8.80581137986045
More than 50 % of the total literature cited on entrapment methods would probably be devoted to polyacrylamide gel entrapment.	10.279295397070511
This 2 cancels out.	9.329124834131056
So the time of contact is very important and it is not used mostly more than five minutes and if you take a dilute solution probably you can go higher , followed by filtering and drying of complex at 45c.	11.641156759995601
And then we also discussed the effect of rms end - to - end distance , the effect of bond angles restriction on the rms end - to - end distance , and then today we will start discussing on these two topic or in these two restrictions.	7.3448005470533735
So overall performance wise in terms of the reactor performance it can be considered almost similar to that of a cstr.	11.917173058553237
The other is it also doesn t allow the enzymes system to get clogged and that can be packed into a column into a tube and such a system also can provide a very high enzyme loading because the surface area available on the thin film is very , very large and therefore it can provide a very high enzyme loading and also the system performs almost like a plug flow reactor.	8.256694842776724
And obviously it is always preferred that this bulky group will be or the group substitution group will be the other side of the r group which is in the , in this penultimate carbon; which means syndiotactic polymers will be always preferred; syndiotactic addition will always be preferred than a isotactic addition.	11.382427446008265
We stop here.	9.307941901459403
And if you have some knowledge about the exothermicity then you can actually control your , you can take out the the heat generated.	9.711376285538268
Activators are molecules , as name suggest , that enhance the rate of enzyme catalyzed reactions.	10.023661229051413
In many cases particularly with the regulatory enzymes , the number of binding sites may be four or six or eight even tetramers are a very common example in the literature and therefore the rate expression will be quite complex and their analysis can become difficult.	9.354236114698182
Now i have this and i do it very fast , what happened , it just breaks.	10.56542691315517
Usually yes but it cannot be cited as a rule.	12.513278538273118
Now if it is carbon anion , then ideally it should be s p 3 but because you have a substituted group substitution here r , now we know this the monomers which undergo anionic polymerization , they actually get stabilized by resonance with this substitution.	10.76949910528948
Then activity of immobilized biocatalyst , the final activity which has to be used for catalysis and operational stability of immobilized biocatalyst , the factor which determines the whole process economics.	10.305580671238474
In fact many of the products which have been commercialized using immobilized enzyme preparations are for application in food and food constituents.	10.683449579760289
So , it is , it is very , very useful to application , like film , where you can cover a part of the film , and you can keep part of the film uncovered; where if you sign light , that part will get polymerized , leaving the part where , which is covered as unpolymerized medium.	9.611556750109605
In most of the cases the effect is such that the reaction rate or catalytic function of the enzyme approaches to inactive form and thereby they cannot be used for catalytic functions.	10.427104555079685
K - 2 forms e by es.	12.226666515383913
And we found that in general , flexible backbone , if you have a flexible polymer chain backbone obviously , if i want to write here , if you have a flexible polymer chain backbone , then it is easier for somebody to apply stress and deform.	9.276718583152542
So , if you build a polymer structure which which structure has to be repeated.	9.153212512473466
As a catalyzed reaction , we are interested in the eab * , which is the transition state complex which will give you a product at much faster rate.	9.66749461880117
There are number of hydrophobic carriers used and which are available for binding of enzyme.	7.5635233307517815
Next is a little higher wavelength or little less energy is the uv visible , uv visible spectrum , where we mainly mainly mainly prove the electronic transitions of a molecules.	10.401958922234094
Collagen is not so good.	13.862335778722798
H value among enzyme reactions they can be used for enzyme thermisters because they will induce a change in the temperature.	9.327025740861188
By providing acid or base groups at the active site an enzyme is able to stabilize the charge transition state.	9.940286399332436
Obviously , if you have more flexible chain , then from to bring the chains from closeting to molten state , where the polymers have much more mobility.	10.101238493332572
One could determine by any method that is known to us and i will talk about it a little later.	10.034637692186386
So , it has to be very much controlled and we have to keep all this polymer solutions sufficiently dilute.	8.987255840020696
Now , let us go back and see what we have learnt in the last class in terms of kinetics of poly step polymerization.	6.54374428532017
One of the reference which has analyzed the diffusional limitations is given by reagon and associates in biotech bioengineering , 1.	11.73491538537377
At steady state : pr2.d ( ds / dx ) out + pr2.d ( ds / dx ) in + v ( 2pr ) dx this should be equal to zero as at steady state we make a mass balance of substrate across the differential element we get this.	8.485443103993687
Let us assume that this is i = 0 and some values of i as i1 and i.	11.061643655883508
The operational requirement is also fixed depending upon the nature of the enzyme catalyzed reaction whether an acid is produced or consumed and ph control is a requirement.	9.740011264011594
And also the effect of temperature on the molecular weight of the resulting polymer and will talk about thermodynamics of the chain radical chain polymerization in the next lecture.	7.443394360032117
And the temperature at which the polymer melting happens , that is the melting temperature of a polymer.	8.71938052628345
I was trying to relate productivity and the quantity of enzyme or the space time.	7.574850629810208
Not many monomer they undergo copolymerization , the number of co monomer here you can choose which you can use to make a copolymer by ionic method is limited.	12.417773709835284
We do not have these intermediate molecular weight oligomers , like in step growth polymerization.	8.450164813487133
So , this is the expression we can write and which shows that v e decreases as decreases with log of polymer size; log of l hence polymer size.	8.010244355884033
Look at the distribution , the maximum mean on the left hand side which is the minimum of x.	9.988528167330273
So , you can write gibbs free energy mixing of polymer solution by this.	6.989875681720054
These reagents which are commonly called as carbodimide are available in a whole range of these derivatives r and r , which also makes its solubility properties.	10.114068039491558
You consider corresponding l - amino acid on which the location of h and amino group will be different.	9.1411938218012
If you keep on increasing the loading you will have a very significant effect upon the final reactor performance and ultimately it may happen that the loading may have no function; the whole reactor performance will be controlled by only rate of diffusion.	9.1548884727838
Vm and km also represent a straight line with a slope of 1 / s and intercept of v.	9.993030942375388
In semiconductors , the expression which relates the resistance with reference to temperature t one and t two , resistance changes and all those material and semiconductors are known to have a high change in resistance as a function of temperature and they are used here as the sensing device.	10.257206847999026
We have just kept it in a black box some interaction takes place by which the products are formed and some general rate expression have been arrived at which involves certain kinetic parameters which have been considered in analogy to single substrate reaction because the kinetic analysis of enzyme catalyzed reactions have been so much dominated by michaelis menten kinetics that any new mechanism or any proposed mechanism must be interpreted in the light of those km and vm as parameters and that is what we have done.	10.161783493954774
So , basically they do not have a tendency to homo polymerize when they are together.	8.286232150556884
So , you can get this expression what you will do is just.	7.341789091143101
Let us move to the next set of additives , which are fillers , which are mainly use to reinforce the polymer performances mainly , benefitting the mechanical properties of the base polymers.	8.352244183525839
And then finally , with long range steric interaction and excluded volume.	8.297715145325578
Such a behavior of sigmoidal kinetics has been very appropriately explained at least by two mechanistic hypotheses.	11.108102357422668
And if time permits we will continue and discuss the method of dilute solution viscometry by which we can determine viscosity average molecular weight.	8.310518532582151
Also when the activator is zero or when there is no activator present , the enzyme reaction will not take place because modified km value will be too large.	12.016929277231919
So , i theta becomes .	7.384388030482394
But , this is , this thermal induced self initiation is not a very common and solution for styrene; so , this is very specific case for styrene.	10.133531406413606
That means if there is an irreversible change in the confirmation then the enzyme is considered to have been deactivated.	10.29927023881909
If the two polymer coils have same hydrodynamic volume , irrespective of their chemical and structural difference , the product of intrinsic viscosity and molecular weight will be same.	8.402979497763399
Now , if you have electron withdrawing groups like in the monomers like say coor , cn or cor , you could have electron donating group like ch 3, or.	9.157145207355999
So , there are some experiments must be done , looking at the mechanism by which the stabilization or the additives; what function you are adding the additives for , that is done.	9.362817906116298
That means the co - operativity is very high.	5.57330393713813
So , when this is formed this is a methylene chloride soluble species , so this will stay in the methylene chloride solution.	10.199813534909659
For two different enzymes which are coincidentally having the same velocity at substrate concentration let us say nine arbitrary units in both the cases whether it follows a hyperbolic kinetics or sigmoidal kinetics the enzyme velocity reaches the same value at a particular substrate concentration.	10.25070050189274
Now , how if the crystalline polymers is different than amorphous polymer.	8.405775191570058
In this case also one can write down the reactor performance equation for cstr as s0x + km ( x / 1 - x ) + km / kp ( s0x2 / 1 - x ) = k2e.	7.098011511972054
This was expression for the freely rotating chain , this contributes about 1.4 times , and this contributes to 1.5 to say 2.5 times , so this comes around 2 to 3 times.	9.652835544962043
So , we do not have the techniques to determine so much , so low temperature difference between thermistors.	8.40420340704235
So , what we get.	6.26704726301356
In the case of cellulase for example the cellulose act as an inducer and for many of the hydrolytic enzymes which are regulated by induction the substrate itself act as an inducer.	9.593204952581177
That is the component of the x y and z , are all on the active sites.	7.6472672969388675
That means let us say between one and ten.	11.479522583243359
So , high temperature is required at typically 150 degree to say , 250 degree centigrade is the temperature , is typically applied or this temperature where the polymerization is carried out.	9.223231301055485
Now , let us , this monomers all react with each other and in the first step you have reaction monomer plus monomer gives you dimer and for simplistics imagination we just thinking that all are monomers and half of the monomers like 25 of this monomer is reacting with 25 monomers and giving a 25, dimers for our simplistic understanding we are following simply this process , this understanding.	9.941001099219092
Right . because the interaction is reversible in nature so it keeps leaking.	10.940605035617123
But biuret reagent will give you a very uniform method in case of all proteins.	12.37434768111147
Jd can be computed from a variety of correlations as i mentioned.	14.701300906067141
Now , most of the examples of ziegler - natta catalyst , let us put this z - n , are titanium , from these two the titanium trichloride or 2 a l cl or say titanium chloride plus most of the important industrial polymers are made from this.	10.211527510669999
Say for example if you want to monitor urea in urine samples; urea is the anylate , urine is a sample the fluid to be analyzed and the biological unit which is recognizing that analate is the material either an enzymes or a cell which has the some affinity for that molecule and you need a physical transducer which can sense either the substrate or the product or any other signal which is generated through the reaction.	9.535012184703092
Now in this case , this a , the block length of pdms is higher , as a result this domains sizes are higher.	8.570377048887485
Now this k the slope depends on the molecular rate of polymer; it is not equal for all the lengths of polymer.	10.67934248148062
So , this happens , this reaction only happen , that r has alpha hydrogen.	8.667229182668457
One of the probably very general features of analyzing the reactor performance as you may be aware is material balance across the reactor.	7.941398323317637
And , this is the majority of the industrial polymers.	8.009285275079774
The same expression , which i just showed in the last page , we can simply do mathematical rearrangement and get an expression something like this.	8.080367641931643
In this case , the length of the branches is much smaller compared to the length between two branching points , whereas in this case , the length of the individual branches is comparable to the length between two branching points and in this case , branches also have sub branches.	7.949418649039941
For adsorption we follow a number of methods.	11.257919933113754
So , this is the number of vacant cells available for the segments to go in.	5.539852185493269
So , we can write nu as k p m; from your the last expressions , which we decided in the last few pages , we can write these as same.	9.007415603162528
These ionic centers are very reactive , they are very sensitive to this impurities where you know , that radical , though radical chain polymerization are sensitive to impurities , but they are not as radical chain polymerization , is not as sensitive as in case of ionic chain polymerization and sometimes large effect of , large effect of cocatalyst.	10.400181118735105
If you increase the size of the substitution from hydrogen to metal , the size goes up.	6.882259951032347
And also you can control the estimate or predict the molecular weight form the ration of monomer and the initiator as in the case of other leaving polymerization we know.	9.552674411946413
So , e is a processing will , means the high her the molecular weight , it will be difficult for process , so e is a processing will be lower , with increasing molecular weight.	9.32096067736024
A very important general observation is on the basis of the average composition of the proteins.	8.587732447875078
Immobilization are relatively very low here compared to the original enzyme used.	13.044611943313061
This dissolved oxygen is a function or is a parameter which is participating in the reaction.	8.678211955938556
This gives you the number of chains form in case of atip or other reactions.	12.156800197010988
Now this is basically the rate at which , this is r 1, this is the ratio of homo propagation and cross prosperous.	12.506891694113897
So , this term this term is nothing but a .	8.214402850193174
It is with respect to first substrate binding.	8.628077791758985
Now , let us talk about the first case , where we talked about ideal co polymerization.	6.7162057390547485
But substrate concentration keeps reducing and towards the end of the reactor , the substrate concentration will be very low and one can assume a first order kinetics.	9.862461755130932
As we have seen earlier that , for a particular semi crystalline polymer at a , if we want to increase the elastic modulus at a particular temperature , you increase the crystallinity.	10.374360190994173
In last lecture , we have completed the kinetics of step polymerization and we have seen what is after looking at the kinetic expression.	10.00907410162437
Compare n - butyl with isobutyl and tertiary butyl substitution; this is 29 and tertiary butyl is 64 degree centigrade.	9.212601410106409
In a macro sense , if your polymer has a , say , helical structure or something like this biomacro molecules , then their conformational structure cannot have any symmetry element which will result in the optimal activity.	10.217891579455607
So to achieve that the recycle time must be very small or the recycling has to be very fast and therefore these two kinds of reactor systems are very commonly used as batch reactor.	10.100778303517371
So , obviously the lower is the value of delta h the better is the mixing and if it is negative then obviously it favors the most in this case because it is positive or 0, then the case where delta h mixing would be 0, it will be most favorable for mixing.	9.341681151523838
This is the equation based on the basic rayleigh scattering equation and the fluctuation theories of einstein and smoluchowski; and we explained the terms k c is the concentration in gram per unit volume; delta r theta is the excess rayleigh ratio , which is the rayleigh ratio of the polymer molecules or the solute molecules in excess of the solvent molecules.	9.77856415883323
Now , you can also have network polymers.	6.223784579002832
If you want to have applications where you need where you need a transparent polymeric material , then it is very difficult to do with a crystalline polymers.	7.742097643410799
But in case where two substrates are involved as in the case of hexose phosphorylation , the role of hexose and atp both participating at the binding site for the reaction to occur could be explained using induced fit mechanism.	9.461499758930492
Now , in some cases , in some text , they follow that r t is , rate of termination is twice k t m dot square.	7.492900673916291
And as is , as we discussed , that external catalyst is always preferred than an internal catalyst , that basically with internal catalyst , outside catalyst , it is very difficult , even more difficult to high molecular , so external catalyst is always preferred.	9.248920147523966
Similarly you can write for es.	11.15142871837238
Polymerization has also the polymers remain leaving at the end of the polymers.	7.952441586051345
So , basically an octahedral vacancy of the d - orbital of titanium three plus is available to complex with the incoming monomer.	7.995360110540211
So , as you seen that step polymers happens stepwise.	8.355593203439504
One of the conventional ways is that we try to ensure that the reaction rate measured in the low dilution region or low concentration region can be easily measured by taking more than two samples of known dilution . the next important property of proteins is their ionic behavior.	10.332026965327811
If b increases you will get a slope of ka + k a . kb / b vm the intercept on this factor will be 1 + kb / b vm so you will notice that both slope as well as intercept of the profiles will decrease as you increase the value of b and ultimately when this b become saturating it will be a typical k value for the substrate a.	10.337896957895644
The value of solubility parameter of the polymers can be also indirectly obtained from group contribution method.	10.959903323966348
Synthetic polymers can be classified as homochain and hetrochain polymers as well.	7.9482848834467275
So , hexamethylenediamine plus abscisic acid you will call that polymer as a polyhexamethylene abscisic amide , you understand.	10.061591786691777
So , that was the upper limit.	8.354477681651405
Then what you need to do; you need to plot log of intrinsic viscosity with many known molecular weight and then you do you do a experimental take five to ten samples and make dilute solutions from that determine the intrinsic viscosity and plot this to get log k and a.	10.687858733583683
Suppose we are talking about f is 3, this will react with a a.	10.700616238326974
And off course the third one we just talked about , that it should generate radical in a practical rate , at normal reaction temperature , it should not be too slow , for the reactions to take much longer time , or it should not be too high , then there are there are possibilities of hazard , because of a exothermic reaction happening in much faster rate.	9.472667470735248
Styrene can be cross linked with small amount of divinyl benzeneum cross linker that will make cross linked spheres cross link product , which can be used as a packing material for the columns in size exclusion chromatography.	9.769756328115522
If you only consider the i theta by i 0 then for small molecules your intensity will look like something like this.	8.3184293283478
So , in what is the utility of transfer reaction or what is what it can help you in this learning on transfer reaction if.	10.24345583640214
For example wherever there is substrate involved in binding over enzyme the rate constant can be written as sk.	10.949004799624431
Then only these catalytic sites can combine.	11.704910111721409
It s not a pathway in the sense of metabolic pathway.	8.71017338743524
So , they are the some examples , where surface active additives are used for medical application , modifying polymer surface is , that are utilized for medical applications.	8.133075375830748
So , that we can free the data points or we can plot the data points well separated with each other.	7.6180938164757785
If you look thermodynamically , this product eab * can be obtained by either of the routes.	9.240608928405253
Now , let us start what is the effect of temperature on the polymer , polymerization rate and the resulting molecular weight.	6.871985290913183
Once the steady state is broken , for example , this gel effect , during the gel effect when steady state is broken , then this is not valid , this conclusions is not , are not valid anymore and you know , though the effect of temperature will remain in much more complicated than what we just discussed.	10.189443577852055
So , these polymerization procedures are mainly for applied mainly for the polymers where glass transition temperature is well above the room temperature , room temperature like pmma polymethylmethacrylate and so on.	8.27851340112802
Let me do it again , its just some confusion , let us just do it again.	10.477378518635511
I just want to spend five minutes there.	8.699394564620738
So therefore their modeling or their arriving of electrode performance is much certain , much more defined and therefore the scale up can be easily carried out whereas in the case of fluidized bed reactor a scale up is more empirical.	10.665789736164717
In the case of the soluble enzyme the only means of terminating a reaction is to deactivate the enzyme either by drastic change of ph , heating , boiling in a water bath or adding some kind of chemical , irreversible inhibitors of an enzyme , which can inactivate the enzyme.	8.753269351853746
Although there are examples where other groups of enzymes have been used in an immobilized form for carrying out industrial processing their large scale applications have been so far limited.	10.477107022200174
This is proportional to the concentration only for dilute solution where the intersolute molecule interaction is absent , basically then we can add the scattering intensity from different molecules without considering any destructive interference between them.	9.16615195705455
So , this is this molecules even if they are thermo dynamically feasible they do not undergo polymerization.	7.379091949924521
The conformational change leads to the dissociation constant or michaelis menten constant for the second binding site and then second binding site also gets bound.	11.189327527432907
There is already n there.	8.62483869424345
The reaction has a free energy change of + 4.5 kilo calories per mole.	8.431600109603888
Unlike in case of number of fraction , you have always the maximum number was the lowest x , the chains having lowest x and one more being the least x 1 x.	12.453149725485648
There is some where something flaw because theoretically if all your data points or measurements or substrate concentration or reaction velocity are perfect they must intersect at each other assuming that michaelis menten kinetics is valid.	9.468621856151307
The polymers , we synthesize in the lab or we can classify as a natural polymers in which case , polymers come from nature.	10.267107126350782
So , we talked about the stabilization of the monomer due to resonance , inductive effect or by hydrogen bonding or dipro interaction between the monomers and increase in the strain behavior of the resulting polymer , which all this factors are against thermodynamic feasibility because the del h value comes down.	9.449228480444107
You have very sharp ph optimum which is considered at the peak of this.	8.459676612559687
In cases where the concentration of urea is much larger in the blood stream you may have to require more fluid to pass and because of this large volume required for dialysis usually a specific patient has to be hospitalized and the whole setup of a hospital has to be used for dialysis.	11.164942245605733
One of the principle species as you know is enzyme itself and the interaction of enzyme with all other chemical species that is the substrate , the product , if there is any inhibitor all those molecular species , dynamics of these inter relationship or interactions is involved in the study of enzyme kinetics.	9.5126213304219
Another functional parameter is temperature which is important for all catalyzed reactions.	9.696504457029937
It might have a very small insignificant rate in the absence of an activator and in the presence , the rate might enhance.	13.518664716170342
An enzyme like alpha amylase is one of the example for low cost enzymes and is used in soluble form in batch reactor because you can afford to discard it; you need not recover it whereas high value enzymes are most suitable to be used in immobilized form and here when i say column system i am covering both either by packed bed or even it could be depending on the process a cstr also; but here the column gives only column.	10.93797693815742
It consists of stirred reactor in which silicon tubing is dispersed into the organic phase and silicon tubing , while it is non - porous to most of the substrates and the products , but it is porous to water vapors and what we do is through silicon tubings we recirculate a saturated salt solution which is known to have a definite water activity.	10.094096654187194
So , now we move to the different polymers , in coming few slides i just wanted to give you the standard synthetic process of the common commercial step polymers.	8.42013219711758
The requirements are that basically we will be able to quantitatively determination of end groups of the polymer.	9.029248172562395
This step has been carried out using immobilized enzyme in continuous reactors so that one can take advantage and the whole process can be controlled by this step.	9.538266910937162
And next , we will move there are few more examples like dyes , sometimes we use dyes in a polymers for carbonation.	11.703477299716507
And then take from there i will start a new topic or new synthetic procedure namely ring opening polymerization.	8.369800046625054
And then we will go to cationic chain polymerization and talk about different types of initiation for cationic chain polymerization , and then go to propagation and termination reactions in cationic chain polymerization.	7.571892939771737
Now poly methylacrylate; you can yourself write down the structure and then find out that this has the same molecular formula as poly methylacrylate.	11.02551994388381
Now , this is the branch , this is the main linear , linear chain and this is the branch and number of branch , obviously , will be depend upon the , the moles of this , this group.	10.721370862276624
Now if you extend this polymer chain , you can write a cis structure like this.	8.576349342026809
When you increased your temperature as much as possible even if you do not get a appreciable polymerization rate then people actually increase the polymerization increase the pressure to get a higher polymerization rate.	9.431649444127203
So , only those monomers , which are having reactivity towards the cation they undergo cationic polymerization and the monomers , which have reactivity towards and they go they undergo anionic copolymerization.	10.034221143505299
One way is as you must have done in your laboratory class the use of glucose oxidase for example for assay of glucose.	10.773651015213423
Some of the alternative ways in which enzymes can be used in the organic solvent are shown here.	7.767856864639735
If the polymers are intrinsically more flexible; obviously for flexible polymer on melting delta is goes up more , than a polymer chains which are much stiffer.	10.051279387398903
So , it may deform permanently or even if come back to the original state , it it do not follow the same path.	7.319576107227706
So , basically this temperature is called upper critical solution temperature and that happens , because if you remember our excess chemical potential term.	7.741483697016108
So , there is still necessity of making plastics , materials which can be as effective as like glass and metal , for barrier applications.	9.15278167414376
Now , if you can do the same thing with isobutyl vinyl ether and make a cationic polymerization with say b f 3 h 2 o b f 3, and h 2 o type initiator , then you have a cationic group , and again now an anionic counter ion which are tightly bound; because you are carrying out.	9.59588471457741
Now , after learning what are the topics , we planned to cover in this course , let us introduce polymer to you , what are polymers.	10.521550346264151
There could be some disturbance for water , but i am talking about in general any liquid.	8.782054980486434
So , this is the most this is the commercial root of synthesis poly and these are the names trade names , which under which under which this poly ethylene terephthalate are sold in the market.	8.802766700300568
So , this is a polyurethane which is synthesized from diol and di isocyanate.	6.68306437092852
If you take an acid anhydride that can react with the amino group of the enzyme molecule and give you an immobilize preparation with conh - enzyme and - cooh.	9.14728593305024
They are they do not change the t g with molecular weight.	8.644609818731334
Many such molecules are likely to come out.	10.674310659879621
Now , if we multiply these two we get this value for r 1, r 2 which is basically the measure of we have seen earlier is a measure of alternating tendency.	9.456121467737631
Now what does it mean.	5.934618466281671
The concentration of all the anionic species , which is present in the reaction.	6.458476147002912
Take an example of optimum temperature of various immobilized invertases.	12.905759298354784
That means the total enzyme concentration is distributed between inhibitor and substrate and that is one.	8.166442799039313
It is a function of enzyme concentration.	6.308008651354634
So , that is an example of plastic which gives away this type of stress strain curve.	8.656742071603624
You just add the cross linking agent after a film has been made.	10.364046610973864
The most basic techniques , which are used in laboratory for determining t g and t m are , the d s c and d t a.	7.8515124927772275
That means if we consider and if we let us take a general case of substrate inhibition where the reaction rate is given by v = k2e0 ( 1 + km / s + s / ks ) this is a general kind of expression.	9.454868681978915
No tau.	14.866924986290792
That means you change certain conditions in a way that the mixture of the enzyme and the prepolymer changes the solubility behavior and gets precipitated.	9.118506446004512
What happens in the presence of an enzyme molecule.	11.051674489257055
And , not only that , they can undergo , these radicals which are produced initially they can undergo reaction and get destroyed , or get formed into non radical species.	9.553537396126965
What are the functional groups you require for a step polymers or a chain polymers , so on.	9.879873587230728
So , if you from these expressions , you finally get an expression , you remember this or you do not have to remember all the steps unless you are required , unless you are interested very much.	8.555598919781552
Whenever you make high molecular width by step polymerization , you are going to get poly dispersity of closed to .	11.154317348417635
For example i have illustrated here the analysis of penicillin to six apa and phenylacetic acid by penicillin acylase.	9.296545666269076
This enzyme substrate complex then again provides a system which will undergo the energy of activation , undergo the transition state before the product is formed.	8.666254009751436
This kind of a bond particularly between different peptide bonds can create a hydrogen bond and a large number of these bonds are present in any given molecule.	9.822166415724288
So , if the cohesive energy density is the higher than the attraction of the attraction between the similar molecules is higher.	7.601159556780101
So , the propagating species is less reactive.	7.57925350829951
This is the energy of the oscillator , energy term for the oscillator based on the classical mechanics.	10.185045107016023
This substrate concentration corresponds to maximum reaction velocity.	8.46432721828345
If they are present in significant amount , then they will propagate in a different way that might lead to different , differentiate of molecular weights , which might results in a bimodal type distribution of these resulting polymers.	9.289972767124398
The cell maintains a very perfect economy in terms of its energy as well as materials to synthesize proteins.	11.823375267722902
The central dogma of molecular biology covers the biosynthesis of enzymes and proteins.	10.373081475239404
You can simply either filter it off or centrifuge and your sample is ready for analysis.	9.508106978910272
The actual data is that they have quite a stable performance in the sense that in about thirty two days of time of continuous operation more than 70 % of the activity is retained.	10.457624674257023
Energy of activation can be calculated from here which will be related to k * and also can be related to k2 and the two conclusions which we can make from make this analysis is that the fast reaction will have a higher value of k * , equilibrium constant for the conversion of reactants into the transition state or in other words the fast reactions will have higher concentration of ab * at equilibrium.	10.328332991656383
In a very simplistic term the rate equation is a mathematical expression that depicts the reaction process in terms of rate constants.	9.434591672936257
Now , obviously r 1 r 2 is less than 1, both not equals to .	6.69969280815283
Most of the enzyme molecules will have a large number of functional residues.	10.122680611500611
This can react with this self form non radical specious and this can form with other m n dot and can form a non radical specious.	10.91347646745642
Of course the various mechanisms that we discussed it could be a strain on the bond , it could be the entropic factors and it could be various covalent interactions or electro static interactions that might play a role to carry out the catalysis.	10.445535749705263
You can express them in either quantity , either as international units per gram of carrier loading or sometimes we can also refer them in terms of volume and thereby it can be compared directly to the soluble enzyme.	9.446274285472715
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry , and this will be the last lecture for this course.	5.176261929843524
For example , it can have hydrogen bonding , it can participate in the electrostatic interaction and which we can think that if there is specific interaction like hydrogen bonding attraction between polymer , and solvent.	10.567300312567514
So , some cases if you increase from a repeat unit number from 20 to 21 or decrease from 20 to 19 you might see there is a change in the property , you cannot call that chain as a polymer you have to call that as a oligomer , whereas in some cases some some cases you do not see any changes say after 20 to make 20 to 21 and 20 to 19 then you call that as a polymer.	10.290423161424037
Two of the examples which i have chosen here are one on alcohol dehydrogenase which oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde involving a co - enzyme nad and the other is hexokinase catalyzed phosphorylation of glucose or any other hexose to the corresponding phosphorylated sugar.	9.346898514986181
Now , how to synthesize a highly isotactic.	8.644148355691469
Now , we discussed the concept of t g and t m , and we also discussed the chemical , how the t g and t m depend on the chemical structure of a polymer chain.	7.830355718945497
The third is we have talked about the formation of single intermediate complex.	8.917837829749143
In the case of mixed inhibition they are different by a factor a and in the case of un - competitive inhibition the magnitude of kei is infinity or rather tends to infinity.	8.286375610303574
So , this is stiffness goes up , stiffness of the backbone goes up; most polymers , we will deal in this class and we come across in application , they are falling in this category where the polymer is enough flexible to reclose to a random coil than a worm like than a rod like.	10.108309667998459
Even while looking at the kinetics of the soluble enzyme we always look at the situations when it comes to extreme substrate conditions.	10.733917411566122
So , s could be given by k n 1 ln x 1 plus n 2 ln x .	7.390907116491102
Because of binding purposes we add another functional group which can be used for coupling to a water soluble polymer which may not be present on the original coenzyme as it is and therefore you need an analogue.	10.467354006836976
There is a focus also make this polymerization process green and environmental friendly where you avoid use of this toxic chemicals and gases like solvents and other things.	9.755306244714864
But , it does mean the rate all rate of termination is faster because the concentration of m dot his very low rate constant is very high the intrinsic the reaction his intrinsic very fast but because the concentration of the radically specious is very low the rate of termination is also low and that actually enables is to reach a steady state.	9.838293503184634
This is the total picture of all the species that will be available and the loss of enzyme activity , soluble enzyme activity let us say as e0, residual enzyme activity as er and the immobilize enzyme activity as ei , then the loss of enzyme activity is e0 - er - ei / e0 that is the loss or rather fractional loss of enzyme activity.	9.873161453022306
Another characteristic feature of these proteins as a constituent or as a chemical body of the enzyme is that in many cases there may be single chain of amino acids , a single chain protein and many of the industrial enzymes particularly hydrolytic enzymes are single chains which means that the backbone of the protein consists of only one polymeric chain and in many cases they could be even multimeric proteins that means more than one chain constitute the whole enzyme molecule.	10.700957244848796
With this we will be completing our kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reaction.	7.417560004986995
Now , this two are similar.	5.883255802567225
They form the backbone of the total protein chain but the conformation is a result of a number of non covalent interactions.	9.111795874727484
Now , remember the difference between the earlier case and this case.	7.149778187994608
Now , we , let us find out the size of a simplest molecular model.	10.294694306119233
So , from here if you plot.	7.1612919266583654
One inhibition as we talked that you can add a third component in addition to substrate and product and add another inhibitor either for any purpose of study or anything usually but that doesnot come into picture when we talk of industrial reactions using enzymes because we will not like to add inhibitor to the system for carrying out the enzyme catalyzed reaction for commercial purposes.	9.997691321818154
When we measure the effect of enzyme concentration with respect to initial reaction rate or reaction velocity the profile is linear at the small concentration range and then it tapers of in the large enzyme concentration range.	10.899866553650002
And the value of electrical conductivity , you have the normal poly polymers; like polyethylene polystyrene , they have values of electrical conductivity just like insulator.	12.488938477127828
Now , sometimes it is difficult to quantify the p where you cannot take out the halicut giving the reaction and determine the functional group present.	9.312988277112431
So , if.	6.958270434196532
So , you can place , i am placing this randomly.	7.678496277085504
So , you may require high temperature , so this are typical not used commercially this two reactions are not used commercially.	9.433419711167451
Basically this is saturated ring and there is no place where u can carry out a electrophilic or neutrophillic character by external and open the ring , and then carry out the polymerization.	10.342270532054753
That is what we have assumed and there are no mass transfer limitations and no significant partitioning of substrate between bulk and the carrier phase.	7.843722997669308
This is 99, this is somewhere 98 and in this side , we have x n bar which is equals to 1 by 1 by p and experimental , it has been found to the following something like this.	10.223320904279145
Wong and hans simplified the whole matrix algebra did by king and altmen and formed certain rules.	11.75226089167523
Is 87.5 which is , will give you approximately a degree of polymerization of .	14.303382653190074
As i mentioned earlier the first and probably the most important are the experimental data.	5.715733352680479
This is a nonpolar medium.	7.749436539551803
That means the chemical nature of the carrier has more affinity for the substrate than the bulk.	7.190748215165956
If the change in d r p says del v star by r t , we can write similarly , activation energy in case of temperature.	10.849789115135149
And you can , if you get this property like this viscosity or radius of gyration of these two , then you can find out the extent of branching in polymer.	9.585781034654007
We have discussed yesterday about the external film diffusion that is in cases where we consider nonporous matrices.	9.075720266843884
Other families of vinyl members will not be discussed.	12.88012727456754
And so in that sense , it is not that important like radical chain polymerization.	7.711396252623203
If it is a halogen , then its halogen is having weak inducting effect electron withdrawing inactive effect , and a weak electron donating or a electron pushing resonating effect , so because both this electron donating and withdrawing , f strains are weak , so it actually does not get polymerize either by anionic or cationic , it only gets polymerized by the radical mechanism , like vinyl chloride , and for example.	9.922424054984562
So , at equilibrium , the concentration of coh group is given by 1 minus p e and because we are talking about one is to one stoichiometric ratio here as well , this is same as the concentration of oh at equilibrium.	9.62146884761739
They need to be considered in isolation one by one and depending upon the information we want to collect.	11.686861354025277
Now , we will come in the later lecture , what is the effect of temperature on a rate of polymerization.	7.4457431410052095
All the enzymes are present on the surface and in the thin film there is no reaction taking place.	9.189288369521732
So , they are thermodynamically immiscible the mixing is positive.	6.89876618306586
So , r p 1 plus , r p 2 plus , r p 3 plus , r p n plus , so on.	8.009753556393461
Now this and this is very close to the midpoint of this change over.	11.567221905847015
Then the second major kinetic observations came from brown , also in the early 19th century and he proposed for the first time the concept of an enzyme substrate complex.	8.948851871178052
If you remember or recollect from your memory in case of chain polymerization if you stop the reaction in between say after small amount of monomers got reacted , you will find that you have high molecular weight polymer as well as lots of monomers depending upon which stage you have stopped the reaction and also initiator molecules.	9.446985725320141
How much excess will i take.	12.035124870243727
Now , if you want to do a reaction , and you should have prior knowledge about the initiator molecule , prior knowledge about their t half value , or the time it takes to become half . then you can choose your reaction temperature , or if you want to do your reactions some particular temperature , or a range of temperature , then you can choose the proper initiator for your reaction.	9.034679044347799
During continuous use.	12.972739334784764
Now at time t , we stop the reaction and we found that , there are 400 moles of monomer still remaining.	10.069411965108488
And which is extremely stable radical which does not participate in the nutrition reaction it might degrade or react with self , but it does not participate example of a inhibitor.	10.559392383710833
This is per mole; per mole of substrate consumed means so much of . . . just like any chemical reaction you have a.	11.705006372160263
We have discussed this thermodynamic factor earlier also while discussing in ring formation , cyclic formation instead both polymerization if you can recollect from about over a fifth or sixth lecture where we talked about the tendency of cyclic ring formation in state growth polymerization the same logic apply here the thermodynamic factor.	9.492065447523263
But as far as the binding is concerned , it has to be specific in terms of bringing the functional group on which the reaction has to take place.	9.857629217812171
And , rest of the mechanism is same as we discussed in case of zeigler - natta polymerization in , like the insertion of polymer monomer molecules.	9.655359914617442
This means that the binding of the enzyme to the ab complex , uncatalyzed ab complex is much , much larger than the ks , the binding of the enzyme to a and b.	8.03415256671341
Now because huggins has established this relationship , sometimes this k 1 is written as k h.	9.963896141199472
So , if you react with say this is initiator , you get an active centre here and on which the second monomer gets added and you have this.	8.86385393561489
So , you should not use that and wet membranes when they are used for the experiment they have to first the solvent has to change gradually so that they are wet.	9.539776645391163
Proteins as you all may be aware have diverse functions in a living cell like structure , transport molecules , example - haemoglobin or myoglobin , defense molecules like antibodies and the fact remains that their more significant function in a living cell is catalytic.	10.560303559777026
Now for that , what we will begin today is to understand polymers in solution.	9.504126107232365
That is to illustrate the use of residence time distribution in the case of a real reactor which can be used to determine the reactor performance and such a reactor performance then can be used to calculate or correct the actual performance based on the kinetics data.	9.984113064648916
So , i can rearrange it; x i bring that here , x and z minus 1 n 0 x minus .	7.779714485561008
We will just give examples in few minutes.	6.867404084760196
When there is only one ionisable residue with the pka value of nine initially at a lower ph value the enzyme activity remains constant and when you go to higher ph value the rate falls and subsequently at an extreme value it comes down to zero.	9.467301921419935
One thing we have to keep in mind , a very important feature that during the electro chemical process there will be certain ions which will be removed from the electrodes or from the process.	10.846988235740367
And we talked about that , not all the radicals generated either by redox reaction or by thermal decomposition of any initiator species or by some other means , actually initiate a polymer chain part of which get lost due to some side reactions.	9.536279712221386
Average would remain same , 25 years.	13.953801007587584
So , butadiene acrylonitrile has more tendencies to homo polymerization and butadiene will have higher tendency to copolymerization.	9.603430319192904
So , if you at the end of the polymerization if you consider the m w by m n value will be quite high and its typically between 2 to .	7.922672321210903
The slower rate will dominate the effect.	10.585721914516991
And if it is for absolutely clear application , then there should not be any haze or any yellowness in the material and so on.	8.096112286371143
Now days , these are not practiced.	13.768473988451923
That means , reaction will not at all proceed.	9.560015309244973
If we take the value of km / s0 from a very high value to a very low value , the relative quantity of the enzyme will also keep on reducing and it will become equal to the relative enzyme value , erel and will become one.	9.793890425706337
So , these conclusions we just made the , about the effect of temperature on reaction rate and molecular weight is valid till the steady state is maintained.	8.493501828784945
So , if we stabilize the polymer , keeping those application in mind , then the applicability will go up.	8.916387458376418
Biochemical reaction is very fast and the rate of diffusion is slow.	9.81072207204541
We should do to synthesize isotactic , syndiotactic and atactic polymerization.	8.83364086938555
That gives you a very great operational significance and the use of an immobilized enzyme also leads to relatively purer product.	10.766293886463904
The lower cutoff for this method is determined by the cutoff of the membrane which is used because if the membrane has a higher cutoff , then the polymers chains which have smaller m n that will pass through the membrane to the solvent side and then it will contribute in the osmotic pressure.	10.398092492719986
As far as we are concerned you will be stressing more on enzymes as biological units but other than enzyme you can also use microbial cells , plant cells , animal cells , cell membrane , lectins or antibodies depending upon the anylate.	10.607508367523268
Monomers , we talked about several times monomers.	12.251071062084788
Let us take example.	5.523359217141553
We will take out.	7.628251389601848
So , even at very low conversion i mean low d p you have a high amount of conversion.	9.8848681208617
This is the resonance structure and also the peptide units are rigid and planar in nature and the most important property which contributes to its secondary structure is the capability of free rotation about the alpha carbon and nitrogen and alpha carbon and carbon.	10.242515278952919
That means not a very non spontaneous reaction.	8.03867347001979
That you take a pure monomer and convert to pure polymer associated enthalpy , chain , change will give you delta s 0 or you take one molar solution of the monomer and convert it completely into polymer.	10.221851721692229
For a same , we also have seen that the modulus on mechanical properties , of a polymer , very much dependent on the temperature of the experiment , which means finally , if we when you using the polymer in a particular application , you must remember the temperature of the application.	10.488266781713145
So , i can plot either eta reduced which is nothing but eta s p by c or we can plot eta inherent which is ln into r by c and we will get.	8.622643010246167
If the error involved is much larger then our assumptions will be slightly hazardous.	9.960870842482912
And you also found that there is a relation between the radius of gyration , and root mean square end - to - end distance , so if you find if you find one , the other one you can get it from this expression.	7.125299226005636
If you compare these with x and y , then this steric does not play much role.	9.76301153172482
T m is from 105 to 110 degree centigrade and density as a set , it is in low density one more time.	12.078493294634454
The urea system in urine samples is used today in many large hospitals on a commercial scale where the requirement is almost thousands samples in a day.	10.52260412267888
Polymers , according to the applications , they can be named or classified as coating gels and additives and so on.	9.078972769020016
In a simplistic way we consider a pore to be a single cylindrical catalyzed pore.	10.070940929097782
Now , to remove these terms , which is a little abstract , is the number of coordination number in the lattice.	9.735574165817143
Now this equation gives linear or straight line variation , linear variation with composition.	8.989476860173207
So there are other possible substitutes , which you can imagine , and depending upon the chemistry , behind it you can find out , or you can decide , whether which one to try out fast , which is the most easiest way , it can get polymerized , and if it is polymer , can be polymerized by radical that is a most easiest way of polymerizing , you know polymer process of this three.	10.603033472426478
If you start a reaction , if you start or if at any point of time in a reaction , if m concentration is or the monomer is higher than equilibrium value , then the reaction will proceed till m becomes m e , then reaction will not take place further; that means , rate of propagation will be same as depropagation.	9.876056201139454
If its compared polymers this groups cannot line up to form hydrogen bonding.	10.92697286502129
Now this can react with r star , r star can react on this carbon or this carbon , if it reacts with this carbon when it forms y , and if this reacts with this carbon , then form something like this.	8.31225584759042
Some nanomaterials , which are used as a filler or nanoparticles , they are the particles having diameters between 1 nanometer to 100 nanometer range.	11.081641583530807
So , you have to carry out reaction the temperature below above glass transition temperature and you the glass transition temperature come down with more and more monomer present in the system of the polymerization medium.	8.972382153782245
And then get the solubility value the f value which has been supplied in literature for this is 303..	12.343179318507511
And as the reaction is very fast and complex , this kinetic data , kinetic data are often , often not reproducible because this kinetic data is not always reproducible , especially in this case of kinetics , especially in case of cationic polymerization , cationic , the mechanism and the mechanism on kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially cationic chain polymerization is still not completely understood , to understand the mechanism in kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially the cationic one , because as i said , these reactions are very fast and not reproducible.	9.65968285086424
Now , this this monomers have quite significant value of del h , for say for maleic anhydride this is about minus 59 kilojoule per mole , which means it is not the the fact maleic anhydride is very difficult to polymerize.	8.637356100016827
Like tensile , you can pull a polymer specimen , you can compress them , which gives us a compressive deformation.	14.035273828311139
So , you can basically , reduce your number experiment which can , which you can already your choice of polymer by a prior knowledge of solubility parameter , and some value of solubility solvent and polymer.	8.523982104738955
High specific activity means the catalytic power of the enzyme is much high.	14.661121221553183
You can do it by spectroscopic thing mix like enema , uv or ir or even for more sophisticated cases; you can actually radio level the monomers.	8.84837203194201
So , c is concentration mass per unit volume.	6.975530467595741
It will be entirely the same thing.	7.946778598193219
Normally , you do reaction little at a higher temperature for , say , at 80 degree or 10.	12.50845841406846
See if you want to get the m m bar and number wise molecular weight and weight of molecular form , this distribution , you will get it.	10.434675313126084
If the km to s0 ratio increases and you assume a first order kinetics error will keep on increasing.	8.555346056080245
Therefore while going for the activated state , 2 kcal are already saved as a result of partial distortion and that is another mechanism what we call as modern rack hypothesis.	10.757665705498336
These , as well as the all the propagating reactions , they are very fast compared to the initial dissociation reaction of the initiator molecule into 2 react , 2 radicals.	10.183657257850426
No enzyme follows a single mechanism.	11.082410235777692
So , this two intercept should match this line and this line in the same intercept.	9.50112473294826
Now , this anionic species or cationic species , they are not present alone in the medium , they are always associated with or accompanied by a counter ion.	9.248124159655104
So , if the k c come down with concentration , with conversion , the cyclization should come down , whereas this is acting in opposite direction.	8.817393797636685
This is 1 - f1, f1 is going to the reactor for mixing.	7.790697398715904
If y is h , the photogens we can write h m n m plus iz minus.	10.134205766002903
That is what the transition state is.	8.055823460369114
The first parameter is ph.	7.634613035191294
It comes from cumin plus acetone.	12.249762121952674
Now , new monomers will get absorbed on to this polymer particles , and the polymerization will take place on that monomer , so polymer remains dispersed , because the present of dispersions.	11.12820131695681
This gives m by v n a v h by m; m by v is the concentration , c concentration in mass per unit volume.	8.893265959084175
If they have alternate stereochemistry next to next monomers or next to repeating units , then as call syndiotactic , and if the stereochemistry of the repeating units is randomly placed , there is no order and then , they are named as atactic.	10.848442464116298
If you can , of course , 25 degree cannot polymerize because you have to generate , that is very difficult , you have to increase the temperature for the reasons you know.	10.449310973597141
Ionic reactions are generally carried out at ambient or lower temperature.	11.35351892371422
So in polymers , polymers in that solid state can be mostly in two types.	10.417559519356825
Then only you can compare.	12.587138032127715
So , we get from this delta s m equals to minus r v v .	9.47230038722476
So in this case what happened it do not get a perfect alternate , if for example if i take the case of r 1, greater than zero and r 2 zero , then m 2 star only can react with m 1 star.	10.497119351565622
These are exception; few exceptions , rather than a regular case.	9.075885527410419
So , this the name as the name suggest we take assistance of a matrix to vaporize by help of a laser radiation and in the vaporized states the polymers gets dissolved from the matrix and then get ionized.	9.697525638251147
So , branches are produced.	8.012362730266213
They are multisubtrate.	10.737434030975052
Similarly a number of ion selective electrodes which also function in the same principle of potentiometric transducer can be used as transducing element.	11.255577745582913
So , if you stop the reaction in that level , you are ensuring that there is no left over swage group , carboxylic group in the medium , so that they cannot take the amines by itself , cannot take part in the reaction themselves.	9.37463109739883
That monomer is added in a controlled manner in the reaction medium.	8.481998974418962
So , you stop the reaction in this level.	6.070149582848157
Now as you know that radial polymer mixtures , there are numerous polymer chains having different molecular weight.	8.947740777827642
What is scenario where you have either a or d or 1 is to 1 a b plus some excess d.	10.038541195212144
Some cases , we take these natural polymers , and we modify this polymer synthetically for a particular reason , for specific applications.	10.739353953076318
So , of this all the four molecular rate we talked about m n is having the least value , m z is the highest and then m w and m w and m v are very close within 10 to 20 percent.	9.27567536525018
A simple example is glycolytic enzymes for example hexokinase.	11.455222698264208
So , which means that when you do reactions chain polymerization reaction , radical chain polymerization reaction is must remove the oxygen molecule from the reaction medium as much as possible.	8.163668127608421
Welcome back to the course on polymer chemistry and in today's class.	7.142943246354491
And even at nowadays , say more than thirty to forty percent of the carbon carbon , the polymers which are made from carbon carbon double bond , polymers which are made from carbon carbon double bonds , they are synthesized by these coordination polymerization technique.	9.207972174768422
Very common polystyrene , accordingly iupac it will be poly 1 phenyl ethylene.	11.455234099683679
But before desorption even inactivation might start.	10.719633612283014
Then in most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions , we assume the water concentration to be very large almost in excess and for most of the analytical purposes it is ignored.	10.596955355329577
So , what happened if there is a limit up to which you can go down in h2o level.	9.120987404840575
When substrate concentration goes high the reaction velocity starts dropping and does not retain saturation level.	9.794112245849849
Here it is the low energy of activation as a result of catalyst and this indicates the high energy of activation in the absence of any catalyst.	10.84104939110798
Thermeric factor we discussed two lectures back that if polymerizability of a monomer in radical chain , polymerization is mainly governed by the enthalpy value , deluge value , not deluge value , and the deluge value , it depends on whether the monomer is stabilized , whether it is electronically or hypercongication or resonance.	11.651805712275552
So , this is simplified; it can be very simplified , if we imagine that rates of all this reactions are same.	9.847773237705493
But if the cost of the product is very high which also requires to be separated from unconverted substrate then it will be desirable to have a high fractional conversion even at the cost of productivity.	8.755268054614568
In the case of a plug flow with some mixing that means a non - ideal plug flow , the behavior instead of being like this , it may be something like this.	7.335979672543007
Let us start with membrane osmometry.	6.218483889545757
So , weight fraction of x mar , it will be something like this.	5.483872704831187
Now actually , in case of carbon - carbon bond , what is the bond angle.	12.616829349036779
Exp ( -.	14.02967548142563
Like in the case of other mechanisms or other hypothesis proposed for specificity while we are able to explain that binding will take place , the functional group comes in proximity to the reacting group but it doesnt explain if the reaction will take place or not.	10.083718786757078
So , which means , that in thermodynamics , factors will favor formation of a 6 - membered or 4 - membered or higher membered ring in case of cyclic formation.	7.5402321106791215
Let us see how the stress strains behavior of this visco elastic material.	8.281563459431496
So , it is a oligomer.	5.8213760753408925
We will try to look at the operational part also subsequently.	8.861943633231295
Before i go to give you the rate expression for these different mechanisms i like to introduce you to a simplified methodology for writing a rate expression under a steady state hypothesis.	10.788470085159751
So , with conversion , more and more polymers chains are getting formed.	8.061779395614607
When a polymer , new polymer , new polymer solvent contact is found , due to polymer getting dissolved in solvent , obviously it comes at the expense of solvent solvent contact and polymer polymer or segment segment contact.	10.229684411951714
Whereas in this case of vm , you can approach to that value when all the enzyme binding sites are totally occupied by the substrate molecule.	11.327125999723384
You have radical and you have that is reacting in monomer to form another radical.	9.350911131441533
And there are some approach some approaches from the different , different scientist made and one of the important and important contribution from this towards this is by hildebrand , hildebrand who basically introduced the concept of cohesive energy density and relations to solubility parameter , and this is simple way to predict the solubility of polymer in a solvent and miscibility also can predict the miscibility the behavior of polymer polymer system.	9.994220045646564
Now , before going forward let us clarify one thing in a more often or not you know in commonly polymers are referred as plastics.	9.19491418767248
By this way , you are ensuring this.	11.166630072887747
It is only transfer of electrons or protons to or from the substrate.	6.080329573396916
How much should i take , because if we take too much excess , then ultimately you will not land up in the target molecular weight , you know the molecular weights will be very , could be very low.	11.73248673500295
If you consider the equilibrium constant of all these equilibrium reactions let us say this is k * , this is ks , ke * and k * s.	9.85493477409741
So , it breaks.	6.050499117282628
Now because these pdms is stitched with the other block , then they do not face separate in such a way , that they come out or delaminate from the total matrix.	10.239221860695354
When you take a binding first , you know the product and out of the two as an inhibitor you get a different pattern and with respect to varying b you get a different pattern.	11.877077695369143
Now , we can extend these examples.	7.45998033960183
So , if i want a write a rate expression , rate of polymerization r p will be given by loss of acid group from the reaction; this is , we talked about this reaction.	8.23618438854979
So , this was written v h; now we are writing you can consider this as v h.	8.866043077575931
For example , let us talk about transmission first.	6.448200978285513
So , polymer actually become less stiff , and if you can you compare this numbers , numbers are also telling that polystyrene is 2.1 here , and at higher temperature and characteristic is 9.2 compared to a temperature , which is lower.	10.650992662435918
Rate of termination reaction we know k t m dot square , where m dot is the concentration of total radical , total propagating radical.	9.084096639433804
Now , as you know cohesive energy is basically , it gives idea about the interaction or the force of attraction between the similar type of molecule.	8.373187715296703
On the other hand if you have to produce glucose oxidase , which acts only on - d - glucose not on a - d - glucose or any other hexose , its requirement will be only for oxidation of glucose which will restrict its application and therefore the scale of operation.	8.948406254320469
So , in this case you can see how the degree of polymerization which relates to the size of the polymer chain or polymer molecules varying with conversion.	7.202189060515073
That means there is no concentration gradient across the film.	7.6952204721707185
So , anything , any oxygen , any moisture , which was absorbed or any impurities , which is , they are in the surface of the glassware , they get , they get cleaned up.	10.5836302642759
We discussed , while discussing the radical polymerization that , in case of radical polymerization you get a polyethylenes , which are branched because of chain transfer to polymers.	10.477461090729761
Instead of you can use the para substituted diamine with para substitute diacids to form this linear polyamides aromatic polyamides.	9.951305373300729
This bpa molecule , this is produced from phenol and acetone and this is produced from coke getting oxidized to carbon monoxide which one react to it chlorine gives you phosgene.	12.48515049758808
So , you can choose to write any of this and sometimes simply m n , because we know the , as a polymer person or when we using polymers in a sample that always is a average.	9.757432683111233
And those specific interaction are shown here , some of them are this hydrogen bonding , ionic interactions or electron donor acceptor complex types.	10.43103097084566
And that can be applied in optical applications like c d e and you know other things where you require very clean polymers.	9.311867137443658
Now , again if i plot , so that is the line corresponds to f 1 is f 1 which happens when r 1 is equals to r 2 is equal to .	8.785141928098733
Things like o 2, co 2, they actually inhibit the anionic chain polymerization by forming a peroxyl , peroxyl or carboxyl anion , which are very weak nucleophile , which cannot reinitiate a new anionic chain , so these are inhibitors.	11.613707038195296
So measurement of temperature is based on the change in resistance of a semiconductor material as a function of temperature.	9.218665700755407
This is a dove made up of wheat flour , and when i stretch this slowly , what happens , it just elongates , is basically it flows , so it keep on increasing if i apply this stress , or strain in a slower rate , so its keeps on stretching.	10.469348732046162
The x - axis denotes the extent of reaction the y - axis is the energy content and then the molecules have to undergo an increase in energy till the point where a transition state is reached and then this transition state will break down , will undergo reduction in energy and lead to the products.	10.32446246193351
In other words if you write down the reaction mechanism ea this is k1, k - 1 and then this will go to eab and this is k2 and k - .	10.256330130237398
The number of polymer and the moles of polymers can be expressed by mass of the polymer divided by the molecular rate of the polymer v h by total volume.	11.696940995164098
So , we can write the rate of polymerization by rate of initiation in a particle , so r p we know we have just now deduced , this is m p by 2 a n a that is r p.	8.614331910428069
So , what are the initiators , we are initiated procedure , we typically use in a radical chain polymerization.	7.065907953383127
First thing happen is , surface scattering or reflection , and because of that there will be loss of intensity , of the light passing through the main material , and scattering from rough surface , also will lead to reduction in the clarity of the material , and of course , increase in the haze.	10.280567671402746
Now , this molecule can again and do a nucleophilic substitution reaction and they can exchange the parts in two different chains , but in this case there is no change in number of functional group , functional groups.	7.897884371758011
So , this temperature where you have a conversion or transformation of the rubbery state; transition from a rubbery state to glassy state , this is not a particular temperature , but a particular range of temperature; this is called glass transition temperature.	10.137094896010073
So , this reaction is your state , rate determining in state , which is given by the rate constant value of k .	9.819742325987619
So , no calibration is required.	7.407630538562937
So , you have a initiator forming a initiator radical which might abstract hydrogen from polymer backbone , forming a radical in the backbone.	8.094593666142993
One will be transport of the substrate from the bulk to the surface; from surface the substrate has to transport to the site of the enzymatic reaction which means the enzyme molecules that are located throughout the immobilized enzyme particle and then the reverse process that means the product produced as a result of biochemical reaction has to transport back from the carrier interior to the surface.	9.81420879579021
Now the third parameter which we can mention is like a radius of gyration.	9.005324171153735
Now , similarly , transfer reactions happen , i can write x n r p plus summation of all the chain terminating reactions.	9.121036855110408
So , psi is negative.	7.237089508835287
So , this is very similar to reactions we have discussed in case of chain radical chain polymerization.	6.489235549287879
One point must be kept in mind that such an advantage due to entropic contributions for the energy of activation will be more pronounced if they are multi substrate reactions.	9.773686881764208
If you have very narrow dispersed polymer then m w are very close to m v.	6.827287964123049
Further increase is not as much as in case of thermal polymerization and because the activation energy for the molecular build up is about 0, which means , there is no effect of the temperature on the molecular weight of redox polymerization , that is why , the redox polymerization are done at room temperature or even sub - roomed temperature because temperature increase would not affect , have no effect on the radical polymerization.	9.765070835136878
So , basically there is auto acceleration the rates zooms the rate of polymerization becomes to much accelerated as a results you get a gel at the end.	8.987595270858462
So , if for a proton i is half , so it can have 2 into half plus 1, which makes it two different energy levels , which is basically we call this is minus half and plus half.	9.64202007573111
For example , if you rotate this , you take this corner and rotate 60 degree , then this methyl will come here , this methyl will come here , and this bond will come here , and this bond will go there.	8.861999305907451
It is analogous to dissociation constant.	6.376093518539407
There are different models available for polymer crystallinity.	7.4432058688854275
But for the examples , monomers like styrene , it will be only one double bond possible because in case of styrene you have only one possibilities of beta transfer.	9.968196070296363
And that has been , it is not something here imagining to make our life simply , to my , make our life simplify.	10.920454257036226
This is the comparison and this is the fraction of the relative cost.	9.568046765316822
And typically , surface active agents are used for this purpose , surface active agents are used basically to improve the mechanical property of the polymer surfaces like scratch scratch resistances , improved wear performances and so on.	8.76939949330551
Let me write the propagation reaction for that , generic propagation reaction , and if you talk about the propagation reaction of this , this species , then you can write propagation reaction.	10.804046145449396
So , you will have alternate copolymer forming just to give you some number about the steric effect.	8.31771845827234
The shift is when is small the k m / s0 is also small and whereby you see the effect of on the effectiveness factor as a function of thiele modulus.	9.572002109081179
So , with this , we will end this lecture today and will begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization in the next class , next lecture.	7.069147921650927
You land up in something where both side are coh group , right.	11.282167065041083
So , increase in temperature has to affect increase in temperature by itself even if there was no transfer reaction.	8.163810650600038
So the constraints for the applicability of michaelis menten hypothesis particularly steady state hypothesis will be valid in case when we take a reasonable time period and also the turn over number is high.	9.069551863826176
Has been inserted into the blood stream in the immobilized forms - microcapsules and the enzyme leaks slowly and the immobilized system can remain in blood stream over a few months.	12.561452007217252
Now , we have in the beginning of this lecture series , we knew or we found out how to synthesize polymers by different process.	7.624203604385434
So , you choose a polymer which would be non soluble polymer in that environment.	8.63078407499034
This is present in slight excess.	9.975492659886473
In such cases the life is simple because the substrate concentration is not involved.	8.686614405723136
So , average time this spends in terms of active form is same for all the propagating radicals.	9.777891842598931
And changes means decrease , the mono monomer is converted to polymers.	10.183950447557244
Now , let us talk about this kinetics of anionic polymerization now , before we go in details , lets us recap what we learned in anionic polymerization , so that our kinetic understanding will become easier.	8.708006929505846
So , without going much into the theory of light scattering , let us go into the theory directly into the equations for the light scattering from dilute polymer solutions.	10.25169993285494
But by and large from the fluid dynamics and reactor performance point of view they have to be classified on one of those standard operational modes.	11.281524389852875
Depending up on exact polymeric conversion , it could be a completely isotactic or syndiotactic depending up on the exact condition.	10.165795780113873
On the other hand a simple ph meter or an ammonium ion electrode or carbon dioxide electrode they are potentiometric transducers.	8.524231061287821
What will you get.	8.802381522333532
Interfacial polymerization reactions are happened in the interface between 2 liquid phase , 2 monomers are taken in two different liquid phase and the reaction happen in the interface.	11.705175794788456
But the direct use of michaelis menten hypothesis or michaelis menten equation has a limitation because it represents a rectangular hyperbola where the maximum reaction velocity is an asymptotic situation and you can never experimentally reach that.	10.50196734208632
As you can find out from this , to increase , if you increase the time , it is always , you get more increase in the molecular weight , when this is external catalyst.	10.09231957741887
And there are some specialized techniques as well , where which are used for specific techniques , special polymerization techniques.	9.478447192389119
Now , it is desirable fast , it is desirable that this take part in linear polymers and not in cyclization.	10.732172330622797
The next comparable ones were entrapment in polyacrylamide gel , covalent binding to some aryl amino glass , diazotization , but if you look into the cost of immobilization in terms of cost of reagents , covalent binding was expensive.	10.761016577804101
Now , like radical chain polymerization , these ionic chain polymers , polymerization reactions are not very popular commercially.	10.557416190719648
In addition to catalytic function by glucose enzyme , this process of glucose isomerisation can also take place in the presence of an alkali.	9.562192513302803
These two type of polymer , this classification chain growth and step - growth polymers , you take an example like i took in the class.	9.855932365243396
We also discussed the other testing behavior like , impact testing , and flexural testing or bending testing.	8.947478173843619
If the that the strain rate is higher , it will become closer to is become to hard and brittle and if you do the deformations , it is slow phase then , it will become more soft and ductile or tough in nature.	10.912083848629292
And some other properties like thermal properties , environmental properties , they are linked to the mechanical properties.	10.70098842108448
So , these are the formulas for m w and m n , we have seen in the beginning of this lecture.	6.465176080741979
But we all know that this conversion does take place in the living cells.	8.26266102341021
This is the micelles where polymerization is taking place we call them active micelles , and the micelles where polymerization is not taking place we call inactive micelle.	9.273767370186162
If you write a mass balance for such a system then you will get f1.q . c.	10.757527442837848
Let us say , i have a molecule a and b functional group and i have a molecule like this , which have three a functional group and how they will react.	9.968395608215658
So , i will write say .	10.068911497414684
Their dissociation constant values are very , very small in the case of antigen antibody interaction.	10.829118962368458
So , this all parameter has to be standardized , if you want to compare between , the chemical resistances of different polymers for particular chemical.	9.09412063289486
There will be a difference in the substrate concentration between the bulk and the enzyme active site as we saw in the substrate profile of the immobilized enzyme particle that in the bulk phase and in the immobilized carrier particle , there will be a substrate gradient and depending on the chemical nature that will undergo and kappm can also be related to km of the native enzyme by kappm = kmez . e..	9.576730630823587
S for the given enzyme catalyzed reaction.	6.708540227853094
No other entropy is involved in this case.	9.461774239770698
The net result of substrate binding to the active site which will lead by the approximation or propinquity effect into to a higher substrate concentration will also lead to an increased catalytic rate.	8.95479692413814
But the technical details of methodology for immobilization remain the same as in the case of enzymes.	7.327646932801617
So you have to always supply more heat , or at least different amount of heat , higher heat energy , to keep the sample at the same temperature as the reference.	9.872628736533924
First we consider the km , the michaelis menten constant.	8.394010772264753
If they can try to bring as close to the living environment and the process which they adopted was immobilization.	9.529542889204171
So , basically the bead size grows up the resolution becomes inferior.	8.143648443382263
So , how do i write the r i.	8.780307386937013
Consider the situation in the bulk.	7.875344594502753
So , the average time radical , a propagating radical spend in this form which is active form which can react with the monomer and propagate much lower compared to the time , an average radical spend in dormant form or inactive form.	9.020585703483583
Sometimes , the test is done without the notch where , we say just izod testing or notched izod impact testing.	9.684846426629537
So , in case of , in case of polar solvent for a given anion , lithium will , lithium cation will have a higher reactivity than sodium and potassium , cesium , and in a non - polar medium it would be , order would be reverse.	9.652880860516483
These are the three possible patterns which are possible and so writing for the concentration of e will be e0 ( k - 1 k - 2 k4 + k2 k3 k4 b + k - 1 k3 k4 ) e =.	8.015449334076603
If you take a very high enzyme concentration compared to carrier , allow equilibrium to be established that means the concentration of the enzyme on to the immobilized preparation which will represent the saturation behavior is q.	9.350294838697023
Now , in case of radical copolymerization of styrene and mma , it would looks like something like this.	5.698447499311873
Now in terms of experiment , what are the things we should remember; one is that temperature control has to be very precise because osmotic pressure is very much dependent on temperature.	9.857573841786094
But we are not considering that; we are considering that whatever polymer segments are already present , they are distributed randomly.	9.797709489351817
So , this is the transfer constant for chain transfer constant for monomer , this is chain transfer constant for the initiator , similarly for solvent , we can write c s solvent by m plus c cta , cta by m.	9.609407381149706
If you recall that the immobilized enzyme preparation is in the form of a thin long membrane film which is wrapped around a central core and the enzyme membrane is also separated by a wire mesh or some kind of a solid support so that the mechanical strength improves and this spiral wound module is then instead into the column whereby the substrate is fed from one of the end and the reactor can be operated as in a packed bed mode.	9.981489637267178
That is another example of an absolute requirement of an activator.	8.602422843159916
And if they are in opposite direction , then we call this is as a racimic dyad.	8.533289692915316
Now , this is a typical example how this common monomers are shift or store , because most monomers when there are shift from between different countries are locally there are stabilized with small amount of this inviters.	9.249962019634724
So , the initiation reaction actually depend on the first step , not atall on the second step.	9.635135169410573
So , if i stop , say the reactions somewhere here after 10 percent conversion or 5 percent conversion , what do you see.	8.403229136516753
Right; only z1; you don t bother about z.	19.382422063315186
This is a schematic or structure or a scheme of a extruder where extrusion is made , a one screw is shown , this is a single screw extruder.	10.36318940792372
For a successful cationic chain polymerization , as we just discussed , usually done , usually done at a temperature lessen than 0 degree centigrade because as we have seen , that with reducing temperature you can get a higher molecular weight or molecular weight increases with a decreasing temperature.	9.633613277499366
Now , this is for thermal initiator.	5.4457621657542585
The second effect of temperature in the case of a enzyme catalyzed reaction is the dependence of k2 that is the turn over number or the rate constant of the irreversible step of the conversion of es into p and that classically follows a arrhenius kind of a pattern that is k2 = a e - e * / rt we have seen this analysis even in our initial lectures on catalysis that means the catalytic pattern of the enzyme as the catalyst and one can again analyze in the same manner lnk2 = ln a e * / rt very familiar profile 1 / t versus ln k2, you get a negative profile and this is a slope of e * / r and that gives you a magnitude of energy of activation for the given enzyme catalyzed reaction.	10.456125126459007
And , one each radical , basically capture 2, 3 radicals , and by which they basically prevent these oxidation process.	9.018110013800847
Now , whether a chain transfer will happen and if it is happen how extent , it will determine by the reactivity compression between the monomer and the chain transfer agent of the solvent here.	11.342970137137085
There are certain organizational changes that lead to enzymatic protein or enzymatic constituent but otherwise the synthesis of the protein that leads to enzyme synthesis is identical.	9.057272132984078
So they were the two motivations and when we talk about the operational advantages because of our major interest we will look at enzymes as an industrial catalyst for use in industrial reactors for conversion of substrates into products.	10.043238251722068
One category contains the factor which becomes fixed once an immobilized enzyme is prepared.	12.285920836563774
So , there will not be any possibility of this type of intermediate formation.	7.05665709868064
So , total number of initiator residues in the sample is n and total number of chains , polymer chains , polymer means dead chains is , a is the fraction.	8.284068022764224
It will also depend on the porosity on the carrier.	7.568924473267946
So basically r 1 and r 2, this is reactivity , monomer reactivity ratio , are the ratios of corresponding homo propagation and cross propagation.	9.183768425529149
So , we now plot the data for example , to detect for concentration c 1 and plot the points at different angles theta 1 theta 2 and theta 3; for simplicity we are just maintaining or just taking three data points in practically it should be many more angles.	10.097502354569237
These three expressions the langmuir isotherm , michaelis menten kinetics , hyperbolic expression and also the mannose equation for cell growth are almost analogues expressions and that indicates that there is some inter relationship or some similarity in their basic physical interpretation.	10.927635173104603
An alkaline ph for isomerisation of glucose is not a desirable feature because it will undergo a lot of non - specific , non - catalytic , non - enzymatic reactions on glucose isomerisation producing products other than fructose.	11.140654569192305
And basically , we relate brittleness of a polymer with elongational break basically , when something elongate more we say , this less brittle and if does not elongate , we call that it is a brittle material.	11.213308166513974
Out of a large number of studies that has been carried out for cross linking particular for gluteraldehyde usually protein concentration of 50 to 200 mg / ml is the usual range in which we operate for crosslinking.	10.13196836952959
For light scattering , for ls , which difference in polarizibility of medium which causes the light to scatter.	11.135061489046802
You will get something like this; almost a typical profile as we discussed earlier that it becomes convex to 1 / sb; 1 / v.	9.992180981339393
So , as a result more complicated products actually form when there is type of hydride shift or some cases methide shift , some cases shift one two methide shift.	9.459562375889016
So most of the reactions undergo or involve either cofactor or water molecule , excepting certain isomerases which are truly unimolecular.	11.152131072615674
So , root if this is one is s , again the root mean square distance of the elements of the chain from the center of gravity or center of mass of the coil is called the radius of gyration.	8.796468790509746
Then you have enzyme distributed all over the pores in the particle and the substrate has to transport from the surface to those materials and similarly reverse.	9.69440873350504
Then degree of inhibition for the competitive inhibition also depends upon all the parameters and the expression for degree of inhibition for competitive inhibitor can be written as km . i / ki i = { km ( 1 + i / ki ) } + s the degree of inhibition depends on substrate concentration , inhibitor concentration and also on km and ki.	9.248436212057925
They will be difficult to copolymerize on the other hand if you take maleic anhydride the monomers are very much electrostatically positive.	9.138009451185297
So , this is how the random of model is designed.	7.987599902937091
But such a fallacy can be taken care in the light of michaelis menten kinetics.	7.368828696560234
And as we will immediately discuss , that in case of ionic reaction , this bimolecular , molecular , termination bimolecular termination by reaction between two propagating species is absent or absent because they are anionic charge.	9.924122553756542
So , how many number of functional groups now.	6.250808782376781
It is dithio ester and i have a radical produced by normal thermal initiation of some other reactions , like thermal initiations aivn of peroxide.	10.065518133295754
In the case of industrial operations , you always make a choice between two alternatives on the basis of the cost and effectiveness.	8.338292815797157
Now , let us continue the discussion having the last lecture on the chain transfer reaction.	7.0308304766764325
Now , the product of at the end of the polymerization , you get the product , the polymer product as dispersed particles not a bead not a large beads like suspension polymers , that there is a much smaller size about say 0.05 to 1 micron size , particles which are dispersed in a aqueous medium.	8.977711868566434
Rate of reaction and the mass transfer rate are identical under steady state situation and therefore they can be experimentally determined and one can then take the parameter which takes into account the immobilized enzyme reactor performance incorporating the external film diffusion.	10.058766732784497
So , what are the characterize , for the characteristic for the interfacial polymerization we just discussed one that polymerization occurs the interfacial of two liquids and each of the liquid phase contains one reactant.	9.431855107611637
Another example could be zinc oxide and iron oxide based , some other pigments also can be used.	8.934278624759552
At the active center , the formation happened by addition of a alkyl to this vacant d - orbital of five coordinated titanium three plus.	9.034164765696033
If we look at the analyses of such a system you will notice that you can write the three different equilibrium and get the concentrations of individual enzyme species that are present in the three states.	9.770163809045114
Otherwise there is no practical application of pvc of polyvinyl chloride also , though it has a rigid back bone.	12.245480387109279
The iupac name becomes you know very complicated , very difficult mostly for this step growth polymers.	9.206336148027516
Now , in case of radical , first talk about the radical reaction.	6.5682333813476115
Now let us talk about different types of co polymerization , and corresponding chain micro structures; types of co polymerization and corresponding chain micro structure.	7.706303221659521
You can find out what is the maximum temperature it can be use.	9.296603562882291
You can use any length of the hydrocarbon chain.	9.893686992881875
If e 1 minus e 2 goes up then it will be in an extreme because e 1 and e 2 will get a r 1, r 2 close to 1 which will give ideal copolymerization as we expect.	11.39565598587141
Then we can get coordination; strong coordination between monomers and the incoming the active chain end and the counter ion.	7.965975001193654
One of the important things that we should recall is that these intermolecular cross linking requires certain very reactive reagents so that the functional groups of the enzyme can covalently bind under mild reaction conditions.	9.303274919632592
The active side is electron deficient , bridged complex formed by chemisorption of the alkyl aluminum; the electropositive alkyl , metal alkyl with a small ionic radius on the co - catalyst surface.	9.997601865402585
Now , why do we need co polymer.	6.556849661692344
The polymers are now getting and finding applications is very , very high in products specially , also in health care related products.	10.558779671106333
So , it is is not very economic in true sense and as you as you saw that we have to use wider lot of organic solvent and handling that large amount of organic solvent recycling them , and storing them and is a environmental hazard as well storing and handling them this organic solvent.	9.440376519565229
If you extrapolate these two lines , at the point where ph and pk are identical you will get a point of intersection at which the two lines will merge.	10.544456905766529
This is the number of vacant cells available for this i plus first polymer chains to get in.	7.06816402202762
So , if you , if you do not add additives for stabilization , then the polyvinyl chloride , we get out of; the molded part will have very poor mechanical properties , which is , which are not useful for particle applications.	9.909856915622719
But in a large system it is always difficult to maintain and it is always desirable to identify or characterize your reactor with reference to flow behavior and then make a correction factor when the design part comes into.	10.407525632095297
I found applications in only biomedical applications.	9.974529827941543
It involves molecular dynamics between the various species involved in the reaction.	8.046701843077708
If it is completely comfortable with the polymer matrix then it will soluble in the polymer matrix so , it will not come out to the surface and if it is completely in comfortable then it will bloom out of the surface . . . so , the additives in this case , must be partially comfortable so , that it may get the surface but be in the polymer matrix.	11.90822067686284
Now , one thing you might have noticed that for 100 percent bulk whether 80 or 60 percent it as reached a 100 percent conversion of the monomer where for the bulk polymerization 100 percent of the monomer as not reacted and make polymers , it as not polymerized 100 percent.	10.066049976105731
It could be ammonium persulphate or potassium per sulphate or riboflavin.	9.902270741276551
It also participates in the catalytic mechanism.	7.978706529910112
So , we just talked about different possible possibilities of initiation reaction , propagation reactions and types of termination reactions possible in case of cationic chain polymerization.	7.210435555390708
See if you have a lactum your opening up and making a polyester or you have a lactum you are opening up and making a poly amide.	9.912299708748627
Now , for temperature 298 k or 25 degree centigrade , what is the m e for different monomers.	9.763501426983302
That is v = klam ( sb - ss ) = rm under steady state both the biochemical reaction and the mass transfer rate are equal.	8.079971692740848
Finally if not a major scientific fact but at least the economic feature is the regenerability and cost.	10.949478683271792
It is the e0 which is modified or reduced by a factor of 1 + i / ki.	6.592003741870586
As time goes , no reaction forward.	11.20831906578097
So , if this is the data to convince you , that if you increase the polarity , which is given by dielectric constant , the rate constant or the rate of the polymerization reaction increases.	9.155255459661554
So , no change in the concentration of m dot this is constant and steady state , but with more and more reaction happening , more and more conversion is happening.	8.763356054129352
So , you can start from one point , one end and just put the other randomly of course , the chain length the length of the each bond has to be equal.	9.239705887365405
If that activation energy for the termination is higher than the combination of activation energy of initiation plus propagation , then it will become negative , so the rate increases with the temperature.	9.916596590095516
But it will be called crude protein in the sense that it will also measure all those molecules which contains nitrogen in addition to proteins.	9.949962655017808
If your k is higher , then you can afford to keep some of the water molecules in the system.	7.518526122186194
This is minus 88 minus 110, acrylonitrile minus 76 minus 109, methyl acrylate 78, m m a minus 56, propane minus 84, one butyne minus 84, isobutylene minus 48, two more styrene minus 73 and alpha methyl styrene minus 3.	10.709549900534183
That is v0 = vm . a.b vm is the maximum reaction velocity where both the substrates a and b are in saturating concentrations.	9.008519801457732
Similarly here also if you make assumptions of zero order or first order situation when k m is much , much smaller than s0, that is a zero order system.	8.764245740217412
What are the inhibitors present.	10.67452756746691
So , k transfer is given by rate constant transfer monomer , m dot m by k p m dot m plus , if i talk about the initiated then , k transfer initiated m dot i k p m dot m plus others , 1 over x n 0 n by k p plus k transfer i by k p i by m so on.	9.696267449799581
One of the very early understanding that as early as 1890, oxten proposed such a mechanism which puts a limit just like in the case of rate of a reaction we have a thermo dynamic limit.	9.438435358082785
Nanotrubes specially , carbon nanotubes because of , they are very highly potential , this single one carbon nanotube or multi one carbon nanotubes are now a days , used for different polymeric nanocomposites.	11.593462841548508
Let us talk about a amorphous material; the glassy state a to b is a perfect glasstic material , so if you apply stress strain , apply a stress it will strain , as long as stress is there , strain will be there , if you remove the stress the strain will become 0, so that is the example of perfectly glassy material or elastic material.	9.94456325081198
So , number of , what is nu.	10.20577488694531
You can have some kind of sleeve which holds this layer.	9.578815380159519
Whereas when we integrate the equation from zero to time t let us say to a conversion factor of 90 % or 95 % or 99 % , the reaction rate is not likely to remain the same as that of the initial time.	10.250561162780047
So , i know; we know , what are the strategies.	8.677288426188987
The difference between the two parameters is k2 / k1and two parameters will become identical if we assume that the k2 is much , much less than k - 1, if the k2 is assumed to be very , very small rate constant compared to k - .	8.523846617524393
So , they reshuffle all the time you know during entire reaction there always reshuffling happening between the chains.	8.328162847006224
Now , if this is detected at 0 angle there is no phase lag between two scattered radiations as they travelled the same distance.	9.24690738249748
As a matter of conventional practice if we get let us say 3.6, we consider the next integer that is binding sites are four because the number of binding sites if we get less is primarily because of the other not completely saturated enzyme molecule.	9.735788368189331
And from that , the values for individual values we can actually estimate or we can predict or we can quantitatively get the amount of say tacticity; which is the r fraction , which is the m fraction in the polymer itself.	11.97029331604163
It means that when we have an enzyme which is entrapped within a gel matrix the gel should be porous enough so that within the pores it can retain the enzyme molecules which are large molecular weight in size of that of a protein but the porous structure must be such that the small molecular weight substrate or product molecules are allowed to pass through and therefore the reaction can be carried out.	10.206352847793564
The interesting part is that if you look into literature probably during first part of the seventies a very large number of the reactions have been reported for immobilization of the enzymes on to polymeric matrices by covalent binding.	11.11380001348961
That means you can never polymerize at that temperature or beyond that temperature , which is 61 degree for methyl alpha methyl styrene we just talked about.	9.20962704930539
Somebody has reported an immobilization method for a particular biocatalyst.	14.427847831477294
Isomerases are another important catalyst of industrial enzymes which isomerises one molecule into other isomerable molecule.	11.428648577246477
At the moment we are talking only of mass transfer and biochemical reaction.	6.375481524395645
For inter intra polymer chain transfer there is no change in molecular weight or molecular weight distribution either.	10.752232807449895
And if you continue heating , some point of time this rubbery material become like a viscous liquid.	9.471563584075863
To maintain the fire , they are they resume that some chemical reaction happening , which are basically radical processes , which maintain the phase fire.	12.239053976083822
A large number of products are available commercially.	8.04945584876198
But for polymers because they cannot be vaporizable vaporize or polymers are not vaporizable , you cannot experimentally get the value of solubility parameter for the polymer because they are large in size.	10.786034339914426
Once it reaches this value , it will not proceed.	13.656395969626924
So , that is k termination by coupling; this is a coupling process.	8.422295811288521
You have also seen , that equilibrium are very , equilibrium is , equilibrium consideration are also very important , prime important.	9.254997099245873
The second environmental parameter which is very important is temperature.	8.702409578697306
Now the initially what happened.	7.076350393942019
It can undergo reversible atom transfer reduction process , where you get r dot plus cu br 2 l.	10.51212135818019
And as you can see the stress strain behavior changes at a lower temperature , it becomes hard and brittle.	8.214054286112267
So , to find out , what is inherent thermal degradation behavior , the thermogravimetric analysis is done , which is in short called tga.	11.397101532518755
Again like the ideal solution , the arrangements between a single polymer chains are identical.	10.619690714806696
H and.	10.295898126586875
Where in this case , its free volume increases , and flexibility of the polymer chain increases , because of the increase in free volume.	9.99240986620005
But the enzyme acts on glycerol molecule and produces l - glycerol - 3 - phosphate.	8.8651425728527
So , the reaction the concentration of the radical the propagating radical goes up.	6.736004583027201
Most of the alkylating agents will alkylate some of the amino acids residues and thereby make the enzyme inactive.	10.203771713776748
Now , you cannot call this as a surfactant micelle in more is basically , now you can have to name polymer particle plus free monomer stabilized by absorption of surfactant , you got it.	9.890608309149835
And , we know that x n is m w , m n bar is m 0 x n bar.	9.797213333931674
Now , the tie line is the line straight line connecting two points in that curve and this line , which is a vertical line parallel to the y axis.	10.218454726728242
So , just rewrite this.	6.907147028742045
And direct reaction you can take instead of terephthalate acid you can take dimethyl ester of terephthalate acid you can take acid chloride and acid an hydride and so on an hydride and so on.	9.238259356807475
To predict the monomer or the composition of the copolymer , you can look at the polymerization rate of the individual homopolymers , likes for example if you.	11.627402721681214
Very often a comparison of the first and the third case is not logical because the reaction conditions are different and comparing the turn over number may not be a very reasonable proposition.	10.570806677366903
In the bulk what happen , bulk they could be two thing happening; one is scattering can happen , and now because of scattering , there will be loss of intensity of light , and molecular absorption can happen , due to presence of some cromophrous , or some pigment in the material , which could lead to formation of color in the medium.	9.15877876325078
You must be familiar with the primary structural determination of proteins.	10.08952803023556
Now what are the geometries of these carbon atoms , what is the hybridization.	11.659059942580381
The size can be varied from almost about two to three microns to ten microns almost like an artificial cell , a yeast cell for example.	10.225739047405662
So , these are aromatic polyamides and commonly known as aramid polymers and because the reactivity of this nitrogen attach to the aromatic ring is much less compared to if it as a simple aliphatic aliphatic aliphatic group.	8.768598591052251
There is also emphasis of making new polymers of complicated structures which will find applications in newer especially in medicines and also this this is a continued research interest where you take existing polymers and add additive fillers , new additive fillers or different processing step , now improve processing include polymer processing where you you make this different improved application of or newer applications of the existing polymer.	10.36637759133211
These pair of electrons looking for a positively charged nucleus donates a pair of electrons to form the desired bond.	10.306593910992468
The first example that i want to illustrate with the use of immobilized enzyme is the production of l amino acids by immobilized amino acylase.	9.771620439137159
Practically it may be difficult to consider all these effects in one go because sometimes they may be counteracting and so the net effect of what we notice is a very complex phenomenon , all over.	11.669167307018487
So , that you can make a high molecular weight and reaction get faster and you get the final formed final polymer in terms of a sheet.	9.288795143267597
A special case of ordered ternary complex formation when b reacts with ea; the order is important.	7.959014849273712
So , we have now learnt transfer reaction and inhibitor inhibition relation and retardation reaction as well; now let us talk about how one determine this different rates experimentally by experiment.	8.559968803562342
So let us plot r p verses conversation for a bulk polymerization; that means , 100 percent polymerization again , remember r p is k p m m dot.	10.243557152479465
And , i take out 2 students and add 2, 40 years , say , professors from any college.	10.728651830056004
And miscible polymer blend is a mixture of polymers , which are homogeneous at molecular level.	9.411495635416076
Now , if this is not equals to 1 and if r 1 is the more reactive monomer compared to r 2, m 1 is the more reactive monomer compared to m 2, and then it will be skewed.	8.830415073601948
We are all familiar of how the different components or molecules or intermediates in a living cell are synthesized.	9.157060836813281
In the second category of reversible inhibitors , the inhibitor binds to the enzyme in a reversible manner.	9.134762591980165
So , these are the things these are strategies are applied for in industry for using bulk polymerization.	6.9706112015308905
The disruption of the non covalent interaction is good enough to lead to denaturation.	11.430022864274513
There are minority of polymers are taken to the applications where polymers are used along with the other ingredients like in detergents.	9.753210817216964
So , that is half , minus half , just one minute , this is chi minus half.	9.156908157573149
Now let us revisit , the discussion we had on chain polymerization in first two , lectures during introduction.	9.096455857409001
It generates the potential and that potential is measured and calibrated in the form of ph change and that can be used simply.	11.078968918176802
Sk1 form es.	14.833420510983292
And the , now let us talk about the third type of initiation , which is that photo initiation or photo chemical reactions , photo initiation.	9.592383029766987
Now , later on the large number of catalyst was discovered , developed.	11.000524090496603
So , except the two ends , each segment have z minus 1 contact.	6.686873953424437
They cannot pack well in a crystal lattice and as a result this has soft polymer.	9.845854234135066
Let us say this is expression one.	6.982850437372893
When i say analogue i am referring to some chemical and structural modifications but the role of coenzyme is retained by the molecule.	8.612761895959302
Now , the region this side below this point say i if i write c and it is a point d below left hand side c and above d is similar to this expression.	10.20045590768313
To over come this problem if the adsorption process is coupled with cross linking of the enzymes so that ultimately what happens is that each of the enzyme molecule present here is supported on a matrix and also cross linked to each other so that it forms a multi variant force by which the enzyme will not be a desorbed because it is now covalently linked to each other.	10.669519166740818
In all those cases as long as your m 1 and m 2 are same , the composition in the copolymer would be same , irrespective of the initiation mechanizing you have applied , and also it does not depends upon whether there is presence or absence of chain transfer reactions in the medium or not , but as i said that if the mode of initiation , like whether its anionic cationic or radical , that change , then obviously the composition of the two monomers in the co polymers will change.	10.0810802677073
Not that there are no proteins which are not in the extended form.	10.851419657216962
Now people understood that enzymes cannot be used in the non - polar environment which ultimately proved wrong in atleast for the last twenty years and people have looked at a number of water immiscible solvents which are known to keep enzyme in a very stable confirmation along with the maintenance of enzyme confirmation because the quantity of water required for interaction with the enzyme protein is a very small bound water molecule around the external surface of the molecule which is retained and which is not very easy to be removed by normal dehydration methods.	11.530639677219186
But on the carboxylic group this serine functional group of side chain of the active site can attack.	10.641722751150695
In the case of a generalized rate expression one can just write 1 / v0 = ( 1 + ka / a + kb / b + k a . kb / ab ) / vm that is the double reciprocal plot if we divide both the numerator and denominator by a into b you will get rate expression.	7.915192089462605
Now , this part is temperature independent , whereas the other term , the rate constant k p k d to the power half and k t to the power half , these are all rate constant values.	7.953230042250765
So , number of molecules reacted , so number of molecules reacted is n 0 minus n.	7.525399930053866
Titanium oxides , it is another uv absorber , which absorbs highly below 370 nano meter.	14.569177924174717
That was initial hypothesis and based on this hypothesis we had also arrived at a rate expression vo = k2 e0 s / km + s i am just writing here only the capital letters for the concentration terms without putting the parenthesis and km = k - 1 + k2 / k1; vm = k2e0 these two parameters that is michaelis menten constant and the maximum reaction velocity can be used to characterize an enzyme.	8.661925775559004
The yeast cells when they are permeabilized , the lipid on the membrane is dissolved by a solvent and it becomes freely permeable to various substrates.	10.977556403465263
That means energy content per molecule and the number of molecules in a system will have a gaussian distribution and only those molecules that possess sufficient energy which are showed here by a shaded portion , only that fraction of molecules will undergo chemical transformation.	10.367890816598445
On the other hand the slope here will be km / k2e.	6.864865607019302
Fortunately in the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions , the reactions are not highly exothermic.	11.36670142778588
So , you can always say that if we stop the reaction , such a time which correspondence to a p of 0.99, then you will get a molecular weight corresponding to degrees of polymerization of 10.	9.287493640263058
Similarly , you can write the expression for the molecular weight x n 0 in absence of chain termination reaction.	8.542443851767858
Now , this will , how do you name again because this just a polymer of the monomer , so poly caprolactam caprolactam.	9.00157589336054
The more the interactions between polymer and solvent , the coil expands , so you have large size , so you have large viscosity.	9.195721443581977
So , m is concentration of either cooh or oh in this case , because both are used in isometric amount.	9.421589238627488
Non - porous matrix also has an advantage.	11.281151480842714
But if the inflammation is in the brain at least ten fold concentration of the drug is required to be administered because lesser than that will not even permeate to the brain membrane.	10.534597060869485
Sigma is the sum total of the products of all the kappa factors.	10.043662356057732
It does not mean , that if you increase , keep on increasing the temperature , rate always will go up.	8.215575387752663
For example site directed mutagenesis is what happens if an amino acid is removed and another amino acid is inserted in the polymeric chain that is in the protein chain.	10.25719021119242
If you look at product inhibition , product inhibition also has influence in two modes.	8.135882102715431
It should not drip to the floor or some other inflammable or combustible material , so that the fire spreads.	11.25740140282482
For example if we have , for polymethyl methacrylate pmma toluene is very good solvent.	8.822128896386342
Otherwise it cannot be used as a drug.	11.927436851163996
And then we last few lectures we discussed the applications of polymer , in the sense that , the different polymers properties and how they are evaluated like mechanical properties and so on.	8.810716053224747
And what are the mechanism and what are the problem in interfacial polymerization.	10.022218612579538
There will be loss of entropy but that will result in the range of energy during binding process.	7.905698355286731
In third case the system was improved by treatment of the alcohol dehydrogenase containing cells by glutaraldehyde which is aimed to fix the alcohol dehydrogenase on to some cellular organelles and there by making it almost in the form of an immobilized enzyme so that it doesn t leak out and you can see the clear advantage that the reaction is extended over a large period of time comparatively but again still it goes and although this system can be demonstrated for eight hours or ten hours but still there are some problems which are still so far not understood as to what happens in the case of cofactors cycling.	10.690251729816833
The proper design , proper choice of configuration of these enzyme reactors is therefore very important keeping in view the whole process of economics and which plays in addition to the catalytic function of the enzyme the whole operation will be controlled economically by even the choice of the reactor.	9.46130516145116
Sometimes some people call it as pseudo second order rate constant considering enzyme also as one of the reactant which is not really a second order rate constant.	10.530362597603062
So , this case , this is a protogen , which is basically proton donor protogen and this is cationogen , which is a cationic species donor or carbocationic , carbocation donor.	12.127277179588084
So , this is the expression for theta equals to c is equals to .	5.879233002323725
The extent of reaction can also be monitored by the quantity of alkali consumed because stoichiometrically the quantity of acid produced is same as the extent of conversion of penicillin to 6 - apa.	10.646818163252622
In this case , carboxylic acid and oh and also , we were taking out this condensate , this small molecule , so that practically the reaction is irreversible.	10.170562929086346
If reacts with dimer , it will form pentamer.	13.586415721458776
The inhibitor binding site on the enzyme molecule and substrate binding site on the enzyme molecule are identical.	7.2680712020646645
Although temperature change as you will notice is much smaller.	10.824330681213647
The specificity in fact has both negative as well as positive role.	11.342724714639315
Is this justifiable.	15.835251657729776
Now , we mentioned , i mentioned that the step growth polymers are , have those functional groups , like esters , carbonates , or amides.	9.302153744625183
So , what will happen if you start from this point.	6.777803262987885
This time scale up to here is only a few seconds which he named as induction period.	11.052812696276161
One is irreversible inhibitors , which means that the inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in an irreversible fashion and cannot be recovered or revoked by physical operations.	9.744481288456864
Other factors like polymer surface , morphology , processing parameter mold finish , which would give us the smoothness of , which basically dictates the smoothness of the molded parts , so they also affect the value of gloss.	11.089013779854122
If you denote this function as f df / dh + = 1 / kb ka / ( h + ) 2 = 0 if you equate it to zero you get 1 / kb = ka / ( h + ) 2 hydrogen ion concentration gives you this function f to be a minimum.	9.145712192185462
Another version of the linear form of michaelis menten equation where you can arrive at v0 = vm - km / s . v0 if you plot such an equation and that you can obtain by multiplying the lineweaver equation by v0.vm on both the sides and then you get a straight line with negative slope where slope is - km.	10.093365297189196
It is not very strictly specific in that sense and we call it as group specific.	9.14499567120231
For example , hydroquinone or benzoquinone , because there should not self polymerizes either by little bit of heat oil from the binateor or by self initiation reaction.	8.902519712544834
If it is not that stable , then reaction will not tend to go towards right hand side.	6.7992756435593025
Now obviously if these two blocks , in a block co polymers or say two homopolymers in blends are partially visible , then what happens , you still gets two t g s , for a two component system , but if t gs comes down from the corresponding homopolymers , you get a somewhere intermediates.	10.74956375189244
And your glasswares has to be cleaned in an , in practice they actually , the , the , the scientist who actually carry out anionic polymerization reaction , they actually film dry , which means , they actually heat the glasswares under flame and then apply vacuum continuously.	11.101565471600688
So , they typically or generally have a ideal type they make a typically ideal copolymers.	8.350731069183325
So , if you take this out , this polymer out and do further in a molding and compounding , go to the compounding step , then because these chains are capped with a known reactive group , they will not take part in further reaction which means the polymers are practically dead polymers.	9.002965631949698
So , prices also go up.	6.64921052609192
We are considering all this reactor performance under steady state conditions.	8.157241451071332
We will talk about the simplest model , which is known as terminal model.	8.69971430986562
Now , let us first consider these two bond angle restriction and short range rotational restriction.	7.354060397400967
These two factors put together give you much higher catalytic efficiency as we noted in the case of one of the examples which i have illustrated to carry out the conversion of reactants into product.	9.598300134038299
So , definitely , they will depend on the temperature of the reaction you were using.	9.92430757278442
When water is not present any reaction catalyzed by water is inhibited.	11.001455949371945
At a value of log s if you put v / vm - v as one , the log format will be zero.	9.02399845275645
But even under cstr a modification which has been proposed is in the form of cstr coupled with the ultra filtration cell.	8.730231426570208
It is almost like a plug flow reactor.	4.417672542526507
The enzyme transfers phosporyl group to the third carbon atom of the glycerol molecule.	8.253282358757515
So , what is the resulting radicals form in this case , this radical , this radical dot now , from your basic knowledge of organic chemistry , you know which what is the order of stability of this radical.	9.10177388409087
Now this generally what estimates the t g of the co polymers or blends slightly slightly.	9.621439100779668
Except to understand their role to evolve methods to prevent the poisoning they don t have much of industrial value.	11.880382392033301
So , with this we stop for this lecture , and we will start the next topic in next lecture.	5.287337277423757
Whereas , in case of chain polymers , it is feasible; only at very high temperature the reverse reactions becomes significant.	9.167030948097151
In this case we have only considered the external film diffusion; on the other hand actual reactor may also involve , if it is porous particle general pore diffusion also.	8.950733245258897
If it is very reactive , then both of them will react , if it is low react less reactive , then between this two which is more reactive , that will react with this.	9.876944904265962
In this case what happen if k z is much higher then k p which means that this reactions this happening at much higher extent compare to the normal propagation reaction then you will not have a polymer at all , because as soon as this chain initiate it will react with this and form a death chain.	9.742070620840577
So , you can write k2 [ e - s ] will be the initial rate of reaction.	6.614547534082352
Normally a lies 0.5 to 0.8 for linear chains and if your very stiff chains like rod - like , then it a can move up to .	11.5125308010962
So , preferably we use longer column; typically in normal sense , we actually use few column in series and some cases to make the process faster; we mix bed type columns are used where you have the columns are made with different pore size and you can use two such or three such mix bed columns in series or a single different pore size columns also in series.	11.215779446103166
You should consider the radicals which are only , the only those radicals which are initiating a polymer chain.	8.639572318852967
Proper amount of loading : sometimes this additives function for a particular level of loading; too less loading or might not be bring about the advantage which are the manufacturer looking for; and too much of addition of the additive might destroy the polymer itself , and obviously , the cost of the formulation will go up.	10.27028198436042
There are two major approaches by which these gel entrapment preparations are made from long chain pre formed polymers.	8.555090367951664
So , for a given solvent , especially non , non - polar solvent , the rate of cationic polymerization is higher compared to anionic polymerization , is about 2 to 3 times higher and because in case of anions , anionic polymerization , they are in non - polar medium , they are tight.	10.160319686211967
Some of the enzymes are little less specific.	8.98937833516607
So , remember this should be h because we have mentioned h in the last lecture.	7.600705839793965
Some surface - active agents are used , which are basically cover our seat in the interface between the filler and the polymer matrices and thus , help the depression of the particular fillers.	10.510582958562075
So , with this we , i stop this lecture and in the next lecture i will continue with this anionic chain polymerization.	6.235859551888172
Is the electrostatic potential difference between the two phases.	7.084265519840428
While in the case of continuous reactors the use of insoluble substrate particularly using immobilized enzyme preparations is not feasible particularly in terms of reactions being carried out by solid contact which is difficult , for most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions which involve insoluble substrates the batch reaction systems are very ideally suited.	10.024824421906636
Now , from our thermo dynamical knowledge we can simply write the delta g 0 p p is for pore penetration is given by rt l n this equilibrium constant and del g can be written as del h 0 p p enthalpy and t delta s 0 p p.	8.857578144685412
Now , enthalpy of mixing is , as you see that , unlike one , where the ideal solution where this interaction , the solvent solvent , solute solute and the solute solvent interactions were having same interaction energy.	10.649624130767524
Now again this can be stabilized , by resonance , by this.	8.528870492499975
Now , sometimes few people write this is as a meso gives you isotactic , so they write as a i , and the which gives a syndiotactic as small s as well.	8.806364587125469
If you do it in a little higher say about 40 percent you get like this if you say 60 percent is the 60 percent monomer in the solution , you gel effect 80 percent you get even before the this 100, 100 percent conversion , this is bulk.	9.902309676063462
Sometimes , if you add some , if deliberately wants some reactions to happen at higher temperature then , you can do in extruder.	12.222735970707634
To the emulsified monomer solution , you add another hydrophobic monomer dissolved in the same solvent.	8.94388188583307
Other way , compared to covalent binding.	9.352735227267853
For example all the carriers like hydrophobic binding or ionic binding were originally developed for chromatographic separations where the function is same.	8.836016568335552
So , i can write this and breakdowns this mathematically and just write this one; remember 1 for the solvent and we generally write 2 for the solute molecules.	7.40133641695038
So therefore the active sites are not functional yet because instead of one molecule there are two molecules attached and the enzyme substrate complex so results in the form of dead end complex which doesn t go into the final product forming stage.	10.672438185916942
In this case , between the two functional groups , between oh and ch for a esterification reaction; the reaction takes place by the collision between the 2 functional group; not all the collisions are useful; not every collision between the oh group and coh gives you esterification.	9.698139880843158
We will continue today our discussion on enzymatic catalysis and particularly the ways in which the enzyme can lower the free energy of activation of a chemical reaction it catalysis.	9.32320227597052
So , what means that if you plot these delta g m versus pie 2 then the slope will be given by this and the intercept would be given by this values.	8.961551398629355
So , in this glassy region the polymer cannot the temperature is below the glass transition it cannot make any more further any more it can take up participate in further polymerization.	8.716897370833106
So , if one temperature you got binodal points here and here another points you got binodal points here and here , the another one here and here you have just joined them and got a binodal curve.	8.138110485510417
The other type of initiator is like a high by , initiation by high energy , energy radiation , like gamma ray or x ray.	8.604419993774568
And examples where there are strong interaction between the solvent and the polymer , the entropy factor becomes negative.	10.856628266657342
For retention of the coenzyme we use instead of a small molecular weight coenzyme , a water soluble polymer bound coenzyme.	9.25796913680251
Now , there is certain difference between the term plastics and polymer.	7.9126766352066475
Instead of hydrogen peroxide , you can use the other peroxides , so hydro peroxides as well , and this case you can use other ions as well.	10.650793817826402
So for this binding of a to x only three are required.	8.70798199774494
To just repeat about this copolymers generally , we use the term copolymers where the polymer is synthesized form to different monomers where the monomers are or can be polymer individually.	10.488151377717857
Now , obviously we need to know whether , we have made the right polymer , you know we may be have something particular in mind , in terms of chemical structures , in terms of end groups of the polymer and if you are making copolymer.	11.823030670122515
So , this is typically that is the difficulty in this technique.	7.815664196166698
So , if you are considering polymer sample this fragmentation of the polymer chain during the vaporization will give you lot of error and that is not acceptable.	9.961506087553074
The ratio is twenty seven fold.	12.57441875554828
Now , what in addition.	8.11770546681055
Carboxylic acids have both the ends which will ensure that this cannot react by themselves , so that your polymers are virtually dead.	11.924241035282266
There is an inflection point here , and there is a inflection point here.	9.993237965698876
In addition to this another very common group of methods which has been used are the use of photocrosslinkable reagent prepolymers.	10.831922451367147
One of the also important thing that about fire retardants is that , whether the polymer during the burning , whether they are generating smoke and toxic gases.	9.560558614954227
Very significant number and in case of most of the enzyme the decrease is of the order of about 15 - 20 kcal mol - 1 in the case of energy of activation.	9.604534467393115
This is how you define a pathway.	9.062433069709495
So this is , this monomer acyl nitrate , will be very much feasible , reaction of this monomer will feasible by a anionic initiators , so it can undergo chain polymerization by a anionic initiator , because you have a electron withdrawing group , which can , which actually increases the reactivity of this double bond towards electro file , and also it stabilize the reacting species which formed , because of the reaction of this monomer , with the reactive species.	9.135199027740734
Now these two discoveries has a tremendous effect in polymer science.	8.970975581956056
The temperature you are taking out if your glass transition temperature your polymer is close to that room temperature or little higher than the polymer will be soft.	11.864648995397332
Now this reactions in one and four , where m 1 is reacting with m 1, and m 2 is reacting with m 2 from the same , see same propagating species , these are called homo propagation or self propagation , and these two , where m 1 in which is reacting with m 2 forming m 2, these are cross propagation reaction these are , these two are cross propagation , and one and four are homo or self propagation reaction.	9.864322231122387
The other alternative case of the effectiveness factor exceeding unity is that of a case where we experience partitioning effects particularly.	10.709440810168939
Now , if you want to convert it gibbs energy mixing per segment or per unit then we will divide by the number of segments total number segments or number of lattice sign n 1 is for the solvent , and this is for the polymer.	8.725382698119926
Ka is the corresponding michaelis menten constant with respect to a.	11.137652026630086
And chain dimension the expansion factor will be more than 1, so real chain end - to - end , rms end - to - end distance will be higher than the rms end - to - end distance for unperturbed chain.	6.027284627767055
That is we are talking in the micro molar range.	10.170308513368074
Most of the polymers used here are polyelectrolytes which can be mixed with the enzyme solution and a typical preparation which has been reported is sodium alginate.	10.611412666859529
If you are using adsorb preparation there will be a continuous reversible desorption process and leakage might be there.	9.280105598458546
So let us look for redox initiators , and the name suggest if you have a reluctant and have a oxidants , so for example if you have a peroxide , plus a , this is oxidizing agent plus a , reducing agent.	11.683401584921052
So , it is rigid plastics.	6.574188812052998
Continuing with the methods for immobilization of enzymes , we shall be talking today about the entrapment methods.	10.401892407825379
So , in this case , because the reactivity of monomer m is lower , they get incorporated much lower rate , than monomer m 2, where if the higher rate , reaction reactivity of m 1 is higher compare to reactivity of m 2, that m 1 and incorporated in much faster rate compared to in m .	9.538692571356284
Similarly in the case of cysteine the type of bond formed is thioester.	8.61924001728687
When i say cheap i am referring to comparable cost of other enzymes and therefore it is used usually in soluble batch process at a very high temperature because the alpha amylase is a very thermo stable enzyme and can be operated at temperatures even hundred plus and therefore the gel gets immediately liquefied.	10.958314848086404
Now , both these term excess term also dependent on the temperature as well , and you can also express in terms of polymer solvent interaction parameter and finally , with entropy parameter.	9.218836616536674
So , what i am trying to explain.	5.008612890830757
The oxidoreductases represented by the first reaction or a transferase represented by hexokinase or in many cases the lipases are the real true bi - substrate reactions which in general should not be treated or analyzed with the michaelis menten kinetics.	9.512547960573444
So , anti oxidants basically retard the oxidative degradation process.	6.945485983006131
Volume of polymer is given by number of polymer molecules v h; v h is the volume of one polymer , hydrodynamic volume of one polymer coil.	10.359717164330217
The only difference is that the maximum reaction velocity term in that case will be n . k2.et.	10.130565770165354
Therefore the two major matrices which provide resistance to the over all reaction is the thin film around the immobilized enzyme particle and the whole matrix itself and the pores in which the immobilized enzyme is distributed.	10.751119006703505
So , it follows this trend and for the carbon cationic generator like rcl , like alcl 3 plus , this reaction.	8.432322344774668
Now , as you anticipate or you realize , that in case of step copolymers the final co , copolymer should have same monomer , same ratio of the monomers as in the feed because as we know , that to make a high , high molecular polymer in case to step polymerization , the conversation has to be close to 100 percent and if its conversation is 100 percent , all the monomers actually are in polymer.	10.080409800038941
So , this is the maximum transparence you can get , out of a pmma material.	8.233183506374175
They have very narrow specificity and we need to broaden their specificity.	9.161406190234207
In most cases the polymer manufacturer makes this as a intermediate products and they sell this to its customer who makes the final product.	8.523822392584632
G value , the free energy change of the reaction , which will give you an idea whether the reaction will take place in the forward direction or reverse direction or there will be an equilibrium established.	10.464539117840795
In a very simple term , in a single sentence polymers can be defined that they are large molecules that is why sometimes they call macromolecules synonymously.	12.897006258230718
So , this convinces that we have to , there is no other way.	8.583237216520821
In case of a small molecular liquid , they would have a certain temperature in freezing point or melting point , they would have arranged or form a crystal with long range order.	9.388672255985478
So , you have a polymer molecule which you synthesized in the lab.	6.45808544998609
So , the activity of the catalyst is defined as the k g of polymers per gram of the catalyst used; we can use in other , per hour or at the end of the polymerization.	7.651335590089776
So , quickly the combinatorial entropy will be given by boltzmann equation.	9.426513245781374
But in case the pka value of the two ionisable groups are close enough that means at a particular ph , the ionization of one amino acid residue does also ionize , to different extent , the other amino acid residue.	9.742569638635945
But those examples are indeed rare and not very common examples.	10.865040029767439
So , total number of ways you can arrange these total molecules is factorial of n 0; this is the number of ways you can arrange all these molecules.	6.233603157444149
In in a basically , very same manner how this equipments are done , light sources there is a light source , and there is a frequency selector , which basically select a single frequency or you can have the entire light in that particular region of interest pass through this.	11.087490907456306
All the monomers present in the medium there have not polymerized , now what would be the reason now we know glass transition temperature i have not discussed in this till now will discussed in later.	10.692963725329383
We can get also information about the polymer solvent interaction parameter and the radius of gyration , and with the help of dynamic light scattering we can get information about the hydrodynamic radius of the polymer molecules in a solvent for particular temperature.	7.829930130113654
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry , and to this lecture we will continue our discussion we are having on amorphous and crystalline state , and we will have discussion on glass transition temperature , and melting point of polymers.	5.838362677318191
The deactivation is not linked to the substrate concentration and therefore in such cases the cstr will be a desirable parameter.	11.9784561171519
Obviously , the nmr spectra for the monomer will be different , then it specially different than the polymers for example , if you have vinyl , any vinyl molecules.	10.158407273804183
So , what happened for this , the configuration of this carbon.	8.110202933249568
I will come to more detail how this gets terminated and all these things , but for time being , we should understand that as soon as this in more often as soon as this active centre is generated , it reacts initiate the chain and the chain is formed.	8.7229781573643
That means your reaction has to be very much towards the product side , reactivity has to be very high , which is seldom the case , which is not the common case normally.	12.176640400606855
So , injection blow molding and extrusion blow molding is similar , except the the way this parish ion is inserted in the mold so , this scheme is shown here.	9.690739673989386
Theoretically the ideal reactor performance we have been looking at interms of the reaction kinetics.	10.060696533652374
So , basically you need huge equipments like which equipments where the distance between the scatterer or the sample cell and the detector is about say 1 meter to 40 meter range.	8.581842791706626
In this category of reversible inhibitors the inhibitor binds reversibly to the enzyme substrate complex.	7.4738140371406185
So , you can use this for very common applications and cross linked ps beads which can by for the suspension polymer , they can be used for chromatographic materials.	7.94664900383302
One has to probably get the reactor performance based on operational stability by a numerical solution and an analytical solution will be difficult.	9.799945904365764
The second case is due to the partitioning effect.	8.02410172843699
There could be intermediate scenario between these two , where the layers are separated to some extent with polymer chains in between and we call this as a intercalated nanocomposite.	9.884808171278648
When we have to use them in water soluble form it only means that the process has to be in the batch mode.	11.395322946818023
I will brief discuss about the measurement techniques of t g and t m.	7.090467926983451
And when you make polymerization polymers , we invariably land up in distribution of molecular weight while a polymer is a high molecular weight , but it also gives you a distribution of molecular weight that means it has several length , the polymer mixture is consist of different molecular weight chains and this is , this high molecular weight of polymer which gives you or which enables a polymer to have this useful properties where , for which the polymer is known for for example , it gives you high tensile strength impact resistant , toughness , melt viscosity and and so on.	10.32858526554572
For example if you consider this peroxides , could be acyl peroxide acetyl or benzyl; for example , if i write the structure of benzylperoxide , it can break homiletically on thermal energy , on hitting to c o dot.	8.866251795695003
So , in this course we will use this both the terms molecular weight and molar mass and as you you can understand that these are almost same you know , you can as long as you remember what the meaning is you can use this two term molecular weight and molar mass independently.	10.325539885984128
So , you have to make a proper polymer article or part having particular properties so that , you can sustain or you can apply to the application you are looking for.	8.682448776447199
The polymers cannot be moved around with each other.	7.527008529378806
And we discussed the two methods , one being that you use a slightly stoichiometry , one of the monomer in little excess.	10.293544517378768
So , it is 2 nu.	6.248727052535773
Most of them can be classified simply into three major categories one is carrier binding methods.	9.135192585483589
Then it there could be transfer reactions happening it could be happening with monomer initiator or solvent or they could be impurities present in the reaction medium.	9.996472240010796
Let us talk about the mass analyzation time of flight mass analyzer which is basically the source for the mass spectrum source where the matrix is vaporized and polymers are ionized , and then they are taken to the detector , and in this case the time of flight mass analyzer; the every cation they actually travel same path all the molecular ions travel same path to a detector and the detector measure the time which the ions take to reach the detector; the heavier ions would take more time to reach the detector where lighter ions; obviously , will take a lower time move faster to the detector.	9.509556314695166
Similarly this can be also polymerized , for a radical polymerization , because again this , like the earlier case , this can undergo resonance and form this.	11.38863815604796
The circles which you are seeing here they are blown up here in this form and they indicate one hollow fiber.	11.20811675541698
And there is a dye , by which the molten polymers are extruded out and cooled with the real cooled or cooled in a in water medium , it could be cooled in a both the ways.	10.589923038618743
The third condition is we are assuming either a plug flow behavior for packed bed or a completely back mix behavior for cstr in terms of fluid dynamics.	10.298008451412072
At equilibrium , reaction rate will be zero.	9.464614135967292
So , it is always preferable to get a smaller width size; for example , nowadays it is 5 micrometer or 10 micrometer at largest we use in actually to get a better resolution.	10.31556760002081
That is the major constraint because the enzyme is located within the cell.	8.593637782429335
Welcome to this course on polymer chemistry , i am dibakar dhara.	7.270218914644939
The setup is like this that the given sample in which a chemical species to be analyzed is passed through an immobilized enzyme column a very small column and here in this reference it was glucose or lactic acid determination based on glucose oxidase or lactate dehydrogenase and they were immobilized on polyacrolymide gel and packed in a very small column and the substrate was fed at 0.8 ml per minute and then this is passed through a delay line so that you provide a reaction time and a coloured reagent is added here and after that in a spectrophotometer , a photometric cell which is connected to a system , the reaction passes the and color developed is monitored.	10.565952197278326
So , in that case , chemist has to design the monomers such a way that the reaction , equilibrium reaction or equilibrium constant is higher.	6.773513585471416
The issues that i will be talking today are ones which are still posing challenge and are restricted to laboratory investigations so far and it is likely that some of them in a very short time will come out as industrial processing concepts.	11.732846456664092
This case is by ester exchange it can be done either starting from dimethyl ester of terephthalic acid or from terephthalic acid itself.	11.075587771848976
It will lead to loss of entropy and this loss of entropy will then be accounted for in the energy of activation.	6.8201702026387485
So , you can molecular weight to the power half.	4.498954131519254
So , this is a , basically example of visco elasticity.	5.962423295807346
So , this material , this specimen breaks from the notch and the amount of energy require will to break this material will be the notched izod impact energy.	9.178884009560475
It is not a permanent loss of activity but due to certain physical forces which make a interplay with the catalytic function , the enzyme activity seems apparently to have been lost.	10.479372104592397
So , if you have a dicarboxylic acid and reaction it has already proved experiment , that if you have a di carboxylic acid , a reaction with ethyl alcohol , again the rate is independent of the chain length of the di acid group.	8.368757303545037
In case of very hard core specific enzymes the point of interaction can be more than three also.	9.633774708719576
Then these conclusions will be varied , will be varied , that rate of reaction or rate of polymerization slightly increases with increase in temperature and the degrees of polymerization or the molecular weight also increases with increases in the temperature slightly.	10.318009712351953
Now , we know from that steady state condition , where r i is r t.	7.522514110573452
All the three substrates which are listed here are bulk fermentation products.	10.395137144745124
And out of the polymer properties , i will spend more time on basically , we will discuss in detail about mechanical properties because , as you will see in next one or two lectures , this is the most important properties of the polymers.	10.614850294899098
Not that all of them are industrially useful because sometimes you synthesize an immobilized enzyme preparation but the cost considerations or the other factors which we discussed earlier may not be so attractive industrially.	10.645839375164485
Now , what is this mole fraction.	7.436342140228499
So far we have been talking about the kinetics of single substrate enzyme catalyzedreactions and as we all know that in the living cells a large variety of enzymes interact with the multiple substrates.	9.004754988451674
If you are talking about polymer melt , it is the volume which is not occupied or the way the polymer chains.	9.028749746434134
So this is dominating or this almost exclusively formed , compared to this , because of the electronic stabilization of the y group.	9.797002485558798
So , you can get the cohesive energy density and the value for the solubility parameter as well.	6.510418733519655
That means at the center of the particle ds / dx is also equal to zero.	6.992082456894382
The solvents must be chosen in such that if you evaporate quickly to give a uniform mixture of the polymer matrix and the salt should quickly evaporate and give the salt.	11.715738454006566
There are certain enzymes which are highly specific and exhibit absolute specificity.	8.601794412836352
The magnitude of del h comes down.	7.370193354150179
The typical pattern of an un - competitive inhibitor looks like parallel lines where the slope doesn t change but the intercept value 1 / vm is changed.	9.668010811604951
You know now , this chloride can be utilized , reacted to form several types of groups , say like nco or ch 2 h or group or something like that.	10.232043278238601
Active site although present on the surface has its own three dimensional entity.	13.897646543705932
R is the radius of the pore.	12.353591895494558
So , this is the expression for the.	4.691177988342217
So , what the conclusion , what the final message you should remember that this addition and chain polymers or chain growth polymers they should not be used interchangeably and so as your condensation and step polymers.	8.336611740465283
That means if it is a three enzyme species system , if there are three enzyme species in the system then each path way must consist of two steps which can form the enzyme species e or any enzyme species which we are considering.	9.554316586255734
So , reaction actually gets terminated in these steps.	7.971244802056911
So , that is why in this case , the high pressure is used.	6.581530236372516
Now , it was first started around mid - 1950s mid 1950s where first ziegler , scientist in germany , he was doing ethylene polymerization; so , ethylene and in pressure trialkyl aluminum.	9.621840741494134
There is increase in activation energy there are reports on decrease in activation energy.	8.295060269974119
The enzyme in many cases , particularly the oligomeric enzymes have to undergo some modification.	11.896386380933789
This is what the propagation reaction will generically look like.	7.7553880495596506
So we can write down the expressions for m 1 star and m 2 star , is minus k 1 2, you can do from the expression in the last page , plus k 1 2, and in case of m 2 this is a step; step two where m 2 is getting into ties getting produced , and in the step three , where m 2 star is getting consumed.	10.410323873515859
That means either you determine slope or intercept at different inhibitor concentration and make a plot between i and slope or intercept.	9.602595554098944
And then we will can understand the thermodynamic factor in a more clearly.	9.20630919200105
Now , this will again react with the monomers and form different chain length.	7.540864379236678
Yield strength that is , the stress where , yielding starts or permanent deformation starts and again with yield strength decrease , if we add some plasticizer or a solvent molecule obviously , the yielding yield stress comes down.	11.367629354696989
And then , you finally get a the specimen where , some post processing steps are done like for example , if you are making a dvd then , the polymers are taken and then , extruded and finally , injection molded to a dvd form.	9.589777175761526
Obviously , styrene has a minimum solubility in the water , so they will it will partition more inside the micelles , so it has the amount of monomer inside the micelles much more compared to mma which has a higher solubility in water.	9.300968422403795
No , how the value of the r 1 and r 2 which is sincerely the monomer reactivity ratios , how they vary with the reaction parameters , and the monomer structure , what is the structure of monomer structure in the reactivity of the monomer reactivity ratios.	10.00870568860336
We often define our turn over number vm = k2 [ e ] 0 and this k2 is defined as the turn over number.	8.34955889521014
So , this gives the similar expression like the huggins expression but this in terms of the inherent viscosity and this expression this constant is named at the person who has given this; this is kramer s equation where k k is k h minus half.	8.934207151122191
Or in other words in a special case when k a = ka; kmapp = ka the relationship between these two terms implies that when they are same as the michaelis menten constant with respect to a it does not interfere and k a = ka.	9.876641130654964
This is the practical reactor which we are talking like we talked many of the configurations like which were a combination of cstr and ultra filtration reactor or a hollow fiber module.	10.81114865859071
The third category of the continuous reactors are fluidized bed reactors.	6.840566053888133
Again , we will consider , like i said , we consider , consider the most important example of the initiation reaction and we consider the generic expression minus , and so these are the two steps consist , you know , make the initiation reactions.	10.68303410280757
For example binding of e to a , the ea further binds to b in different sequences depending on the nature of catalysis.	9.640267114478027
As a result , there would be tendency to towards alternation rather than forming homo polymers.	7.526999627318468
For example the polycarbonate , most of the polycarbonate major rate of the polycarbonates are synthesized by this interfacial polymerization bisphenol this is the monomer bisphenola.	12.022112654837878
There are low temperature polymer becomes brittle , it does not elongate much.	9.358636763292564
That means if you do any modification so as to arrive at an immobilization enzyme preparation it should require the retention of their catalytic activity.	7.861912368381819
So , what happen slowly this micelle core will become something like this is larger , so after some time you have this is say polymer particle , and this concern polymer particle and free monomer , and your surfactant micelle grows in size.	10.156244345182323
That means at 0.1, it can reach only at a very small substrate concentration here.	8.833626252850571
In the case of polystyrene this is repeating unit and this is also a structure unit because structural units is the unit which is derived from a monomer.	8.889393542795114
Before we start the topics of the 7 th lecture , let us recap what we have studied in the last lecture.	9.034065275326927
So , in this case , you can afford to keep this condensate at a much higher level compared to just phenol which we shown that that reaction equilibrium constant was .	8.271322038564463
And the main disadvantages are that the acid chloride acid chlorides are very costly.	9.425164780511679
And this one is w r is then given by this is radial distribution function and the other case it was gaussian distribution function.	10.309653851126361
Here the process of economics becomes very attractive because while you are able to isolate l - amino acid with a much better yield you are also able to use the residual material d - amino acid either if it is required for keto acids or alternatively this can again be racemised chemically or just by change of ph it gets racemised again to a dl mixture and the whole process can be repeated till almost hundred percent of the amino acid e is recovered in the l form and you get the corresponding fatty acid also produced in the system which is separated from the mixture.	10.337261818830157
So , you have much larger or broader molecular weight polymers.	6.360268934499669
So , as we , in most cases the cyclization tendency comes down as we make higher and higher molecular weight.	6.890872707310818
Let us start with the classifications.	9.406211095992736
Otherwise it doesn t have any meaning to have immobilized enzyme preparation.	9.061886048978096
L by basic definitions and therefore f is usually less than .	9.139537475108245
If your environmental ph is alkaline , seven plus , the isomerisation can take place naturally and the isomerisation product will not be only fructose but it will be plus few other hexoses which will be produced and the whole advantage of using an enzymatic process is lost.	10.908779270977343
Most of the substances that are technically called poisons whether it is mercury or cyanide or nerve gas and things like that they all behave in the form of irreversible inhibitors.	10.022088433451476
Pure pvc cannot be extruded and molded in the higher temperature , their processing temperature without degradations.	12.905245524772072
Specularly means the angle of incident is same as , angle of refraction like a perfect mirror.	13.762864185356396
And if you do not want the polymers in bead shape , you want the polymer as such in a powder shape or shape whatever , and then because the polymers are formed in beads bead form , it is very sometimes it becomes very difficult , if you want to isolate the polymers in the form other than beads.	10.203374585859377
Whereas in case of polymers because of the large size and its flexibility they are present in a mixture in a entangled well.	9.996131338388565
When you apply the stress apply the load , it deform fast , and then as long as the stress is present it will continually deforming , and the movement this stress is removed , it will come back , the elastic component is recovered here , and then slowly recover some of the strain , but it will not come back to the 0 strain value , there will be a permanent deformation here , so this is example showing visco elasticity.	10.592765840714543
And we know crystalline solid , liquid and gaseous state of matters; three state of matters.	9.965977472947156
Because petroleum sources will be over soon or sooner or later , not only the petroleum sources , the polymers made up of petroleum sources actually causes lots of environmental problem like green house gas emission and.	10.964329872437025
We also know for ideal solution , in this polymer solution , we assume that the volume of mixture , there is no change in the volume compared to the original volume.	10.558839919982562
Here we require the value for delta h molar heat of vaporization and with the help of cryoscopy which deals with the depression of freezing point where we can get the same t 0 t f; t 0 is the freezing point of the solvent , t f is the freezing point of the solution where we need the molar enthalpy of freezing or melting.	9.75755079435518
But when you want to go for design , let us say a reaction capacity; what is the volume of the reactor required to carry out this conversion.	11.0552826798295
The major reason has been that the distance from surface has increased.	9.443964392736403
So , basically we do normally in the lab filter these 0.2 micron to say 0.545 micron filter to get rid of any dust or suspended particle is there.	8.510466476566265
Look at these rate constants , basically the first number represents the radical , sorry the propagating species , where the radical cation or anion it does not matter , so this is first one is from the propagating reacting species , and the second one is for the monomer.	11.103218852360552
So , if you have higher molecular width polymer , nobody can claim that he does not have narrow , very narrow distribution of 1.2, 1.3, 1..	8.71478121527093
That means its volume is very much conserved.	10.735603855639999
You might question what is the origin of these two.	15.647895238296087
Now i think with this we have completed discussion on conjugated monomer polymerization of conjugated monomers.	9.468374840294743
You you sell this pc plates to a cumin manufacturer which will make say injection molding and make the head lamp cover at oem which will be sold to the car manufacture.	11.356991510398718
So that is what it refers to but allows the regeneration with carrier.	8.541798234512306
Age means the time spent by an element of the fluid in the reactor vessel.	12.590419677796481
The fumaric acid on hydrolysis by fumerase gives l - maleic acid which finds applications in food industry as a food additive.	10.704215164973201
So , you should be able to take the polymerization till the equilibrium , it should be such a way that it should be able to complete the reaction as much as possible.	6.89157541136517
Now , to design a fire retardant additives , we need to consider the polymer ignitability rate of flame spreading , rate of heat release and formation of smoke and toxic gases , as we mention before.	9.902619399719653
Light stabilizers are added as additive to eliminate or reduce the reactions in the polymers caused by visible or uv light radiation.	11.860576599885686
So this will be given by e0 ( k1k2k3 a . b ) ey =.	8.265311060866315
Because we were having the discussion on mark - houwink equation , let us start the method or the techniques which uses dilute solution viscometry.	10.704531012303745
If i write this like polyethylene oxide put a bracket , it might look like this polyethylene or a cyclic.	10.355513804119148
Remember what was m n.	11.418811446125531
We also learnt the carothers equation relating to the average degrees of polymers , polymerization and the conversion p , and we also same time learnt how to get the number of average molecular weight from the degree , average degrees of polymerization and i give more time in this because as i said that sometimes , there are confusion among students how to get m n from x n.	9.5517965394728
At one end of the growing chain , if the polymer progress , then a monomer is always added at the end of the polymers , to grow the chain further.	9.883254313512362
At least imagine that they are formed by condensation reaction or by elimination of some small molecules , and if any of the polymers does not fulfill any of these criteria , then we call them as addition polymers.	9.16963441547884
When i say immobilized enzyme should be used continuously or repeatedly again this means that it can be used for couple of days , couple of months , couple of years and not for ever.	9.952307120442425
As i said earlier ke is greater than k and also k = rt / nh.	8.341919097577811
Because , the viscosity is very high if the reaction the termination reaction his become diffusion control it is difficult that the propagating radical finding difficult to by other propagating propagating radicals to undergo a by molecular termination reaction.	9.468395404098494
Therefore the use of immobilized preparation in those cases will lead to a much purer product or significant convenience as far as the downstream processing of the product stream is concerned.	9.236056501374367
This is a continuous change of free energy with the state parameters like pressure , temperature , volume.	9.240254303585285
How you typically name these step polymers.	10.93009125285704
So , i can write the rate of cyclization versus rate of linear polymerization is k c rate constant for cyclization and because it is a unimolecular intramolecular reaction , so we have this.	8.397492567148701
The physical entrapment of an enzyme is achieved by dissolving a fiber forming polymer like cellulose triacetate which is water insoluble.	10.18680855885978
So , depending upon the sign of this activation energy , the rate will depend on the temperature.	8.152307438057358
So , if you increase size of r in absence of any specific mechanism , the trans will be higher product , and if you decrease the temperature again trans will be a higher predominant product.	8.960310637878528
We have seen in our earlier deliberations where we have talked about immobilized enzymes that the enzyme can be retained in the reactor and used over a long period of time.	6.1505179507105066
This k would depend on reactivity of the function group as well as the temperature.	10.528912452957602
And hence the electrostatic charge it will be more of a lower number.	10.722987911564582
Now these monomers , actually do not undergo homopolymerization by itself , we discussed about that , and the reason for that , but they can undergo copolymerization , in fissile by , with other monomers like styrene ethynemethyne and so , if you have the data , reaction rate data from the homopolymers; that is not useful when you predict the composition or the reaction rate , when this monomers are reacting with the second co monomers to form a copolymerization.	11.22565377240958
Now , at a is very high , is very high , if , if a is very high , that means , almost absence of cyclization , then x n would be 1 minus 1 minus p , which is basically giving us back the the original carothers equation for linear polymerization , linear step polymerization.	9.673515843278453
We also briefly talk about chemically resistance , chemical resistance is basically a property , where a polymer is being in contact with certain chemicals , and after a given exposure , time the property of the retention is measured.	10.467497396383866
The reduction in the activation energy is not through one mechanism.	10.030518703830177
But this is not common; this is especially applicable to some monomers.	9.13779967808835
Of the total volume of the reactor v , a fraction f2 is a dead zone.	8.525702682070179
Batch reactors also have an important feature for use with the soluble enzymes where most of the continuous enzyme systems are not very suitable.	11.935042005953477
The activation energy for reaction in cationic chain polymerization could be negative , that is because it is a combination of activation energy for initiation , propagation and termination reaction.	9.387631868346501
One can have either inorganic carriers or organic carriers.	9.780979615112308
So , now we can write q 1 and q 2 and we have seen r 1 q 1 by q 2 exponential minus e 1 minus e 2 essentially these 2 relates the reactivity ratios of the monomers to the electrostatic charge on the monomer.	8.344170533462515
Methionine acylase from aspergillus orgy was isolated and immobilized by using a variety of methods and if you look into list they had used physical adsorption , ionic binding , covalent binding , cross linking in the presence of carrier , lattice entrapment and micro casual entrapment.	10.49913189194376
Now you can write you can name whether it is r and s.	10.34822654714467
That means catalyst is very slow; its turn over number is very low.	7.114951967577465
The steady state hypothesis have undergone very severe tests both analytical as well as experimental and it has proved those tests and that s why it has become so much universally valid today.	10.379664276743428
I will not discuss in detail , but these are also important vinyl polymers like vinyl acetate.	8.494695818952719
So , what are the disadvantage in spite of all this advantages , this is not this interfacial polymerization are not practiced very frequently commercially , so there must be some disadvantages.	9.852742566222462
So , you can replace oh by cooh concentration , which gives you this; and i write this as k m cube to make it simplified.	9.303948195257826
That means , if our reaction is such a way that your equilibrium constant is the value of equilibrium constant is 1, then at the end of the reaction that mean at the equilibrium , you are only going to get dimers.	9.666105855286087
All the solvent molecules are identical.	8.332774384098457
In this case , the same thing you can generate the z dot which is very stable like nitroxide triazolinyl trityl radical.	8.661134174567627
Now , how this scattering intensity fluctuation for say polymer molecule in solutions can be either from this brownian motion of the polymer molecules which gives translational diffusion and also could be due to the conformational changes of the polymer molecule.	8.974785024337438
It could be due to some of the conformational changes as a result of crosslinking because conformational changes also can bring in some change in the optimum ph.	8.168883013011193
These characteristics makes a very unique situation and whenever contents in the reactor are at the same composition as in the product stream it implies that the concentration of the substrates in the reactor is at a level which is present in the outlet stream.	10.864845449568339
Take for example ph electrode in a laboratory.	10.396953702317097
So , mixing becomes easier.	8.405911319207373
In both the cases you will notice that the ionization of substrate influences the km value of the enzyme that has increased and this increase is in magnitude dependent upon the fraction of the substrate which is present in the form of the substrate molecule which is acceptable to the enzyme and ionization substrate.	9.203710763795913
Now , it is assuming that the monomers which are getting consumed , they are reacting and forming polymerization , they are becoming part of polymerization.	10.122979317613495
Then the reactor productivity is another parameter which is important.	7.442933316383442
Similarly enzyme loading in terms of carrier loading.	14.2654100058683
Now there could be three types of non - ideal solution; one is a thermal where del h m is 0, but del s m is not same as in case of what you have just seen for ideal solution.	10.67446571541199
Then there might be short circuiting , something like channeling or bypassing also can take place in the case of a stirred vessel.	9.74011900176125
And toughness is basically , the energy spent , the entire energy is spent for causing the material fail , is basically the the area under those stressed in curve in case of a tensile testing.	11.354188122870964
So , we know the rate expressions for the rate of polymerization.	5.555624514532371
Therefore their concentration usually at the site is much smaller because of the diffusional barrier and therefore the km value is . . . in most cases they are usually considered to be an increased km value which is not a desirable feature.	11.007811253322371
That means you consider the sc.	8.965744250717574
In addition , what he found that that was very stereo regular , stereo selective.	10.163910328644612
The quantity of enzyme required or the value of tau increases more in the case of cstr with increasing fractional conversion but the productivity increases more drastically in the case of pfr when fractional conversion is increased.	8.912048393687593
So , in that way you can actually minimize this side reaction.	6.371719895183515
So , we test weather ability in the lab , in the accelerated chamber , which basically may make the outdoor condition , with control parameters , and we subject the experimental specimen in that condition , and after in a frequent interval , we basically test there mechanical , other properties like optical properties to find out where it is sustained in the particular , weather condition or not.	10.29412107734128
Those cases we can term those polymers as semi - synthetic or semi - natural in any of the ways.	11.870333300089063
Now , that this particular catalyst form - beta form of titanium trichloride does not have very high selectivity.	9.387281876193697
The third player is in method of immobilization and the total performance of immobilized enzyme preparation will depend upon the combination of the interactions between these three players.	10.606037177801674
That means when we have sufficient quantity of activator present as required , the k m approaches to that of intrinsic km or k m / km = .	10.286109877207373
And , what happened.	5.887119197862071
Now co polymers , you can have random co polymers.	12.81460362699327
The enzyme sensors have become an important activity where immobilization enzymes are used.	8.409816737036369
Whereas , because they have electron with drawing group , the charge on the double bond actually lower , it is a more positive charge.	10.976214368951892
It was decreasing the molecular weight and in places of transfer reaction is further reducing.	12.321543432663466
So , higher the stability , higher is the reactivity.	7.762822037259964
That is another feature.	5.900607214219906
In such a case you see the reaction is inhibited both by p as well as a.	9.472391517234668
In this case , the monomer , which is appearing in the , your equilibrium constant value.	8.684597436005108
Finally very simplistic assumption is that we always monitor or study or consider these kinetics in terms of constant ph , temperature , ionic strength and all other environmental parameters we try to keep constant.	11.660805204351067
This radius of gyration is defined as the root mean square of distance of the elements of chain from center of gravity of the coil.	8.604017891998526
One thing one must note that , there is no uniform fr additives , it is not that , one fr additive is best for all the polymers.	9.914482134127736
He did not give any experimental or any hypothesis or any sequence of steps but he was able to understand that the basic reaction kinetics follows a saturation behavior.	10.005685053151689
This is 1 over x n 0, which means , that have number average degrees of polymerization reactions of any transfer reaction and you can write the rate expression for individual rates.	8.361270492618116
You can define co - operativity index as long as you mention; if it is s0.75 / s0.1 or s0.9 / s0.1, or it could be any ratio.	10.267468347533214
Let us go back and explain with those graphs like if you have repolymers as i explaining for a given molecular weight their sizes could be different depending up on the value of k and a intrinsic viscosity , and they can form a different calibration curve.	9.13598304109026
One of the major advantages in the case of covalently bound enzymes is their stability.	8.103563479524764
L was high one gets the same kind of energy of activation at high temperatures.	11.583910279066126
Although i have mentioned that any kind of input can be given but for analytical convenience we often resort to either a step input or a pulse input because ultimate analytical solutions might be difficult and the step input and pulse input are commonly used technique for analyzing or getting the residence time distribution.	10.010615071465134
At the end , you get a homo polymer of m .	8.476194690531749
And if the value becomes less than zero negative obviously mixing will happen , if it is positive and large no mixing and if it is slightly positive small i did not change from.	9.86923682743684
Just a hypothetical change i have shown here.	7.661887162750225
If you want to describe the equations in terms of reactor performance then x is equal to s0 - s x = = 1 - s / s0; s / s0 = 1 - x s0 so if you substitute all these parameters you get in terms of reactor performance equation for a batch reactor in the form of fractional conversion that is xs0 + k mln 1 / 1 - x = k 2e0t the reaction performance equation for a batch reactor if we want in the terms of product concentration , product concentration is nothing else but p = s0 - s assuming that its a unimolecular reaction.	9.691177226012742
Now , as i said that , temperature is a very important thing so , we can compare for a same same polymer , same chemical nature at a same temperature , elastic modulus will increase with crystallinity.	8.898153899086905
So , presence of plasticizer makes the polymer t g comes down.	7.437326025933075
A large number of methods are based on the use of photocrosslinkable prepolymers.	8.340501312368279
So , whatever if there auto acceleration is happening because rates goes up rate of polymerization goes up more heat is generated more heat is generated we cannot take out effectively that because the medium is high.	8.508678950239393
In this case this is defined by a factor.	8.354318059607794
Now , in case of solvent molecules , x i is 1, so v i is the size of the solvent molecule.	7.565864391950692
All the parameters influence the degree of inhibition at any given inhibitor concentration for the competitive inhibitor.	9.215142352841157
It is exactly identical to that of a generalized rate expression ordered ternary complex that we have written today and thorell and chance mechanism and ping pong mechanism and the species in the brackets are the ones that correspond to that enzyme species.	9.42548386049794
You can talk about mechanical properties , or optical properties , like glass haze , with in contact of the chemicals of the optical properties might change as well.	8.939472061532838
So , that is the root mean square end to end distance.	3.5770631200713163
Now , what happened stage ii , now you have what you have now , you have large monomer droplets still present of course , the size is sunk from the beginning and you have the initiator molecules , and you have such particles , particles means monomer plus polymer surrounded by the surfactant molecules , that is a stage at the end of the stage i.	9.166270777376381
Now how will you determine.	10.57753026499168
With this background if we take a general case from a binary substrate reaction that is particularly for the ordered ternary complex formation you will recall that the reaction mechanism in this case was expressed e goes to ea then ea goes to eab.	10.593791932984182
To with this , we just stop into this lecture , so we will come back , and continue this discussion on chain copolymerization in next lecture.	9.776637310160126
So , the condensation polymers are the polymers where you make or the polymers are synthesized by condensation reaction between the monomers.	7.798312690676777
You do your reaction best possible way as best you can do and hope that p is close to 1 and you can choose r in at the beginning , so that you can target x n accordingly and there is another case when r is 1 x n would give us back the original equation where we started with one is to one ratio of the two functional , two bi - functional groups.	9.600090405385295
Second monomer , second radical is coming out reacting with the monomer and going to reaction.	9.942292372962791
So , high enough molecular weight to get adequate properties , and low enough molecular weight , so that it can be processed , so you have to compromise between these two.	9.446375813621534
If suppose the biochemical reaction rate is very fast compared to rate of diffusion of the substrate into the carrier particle , it might happen that soon after the surface of the catalyst particle the substrate concentration might drop to a very small level or even to zero depending on the rate of diffusion which is smaller than that.	10.361468586260301
Then sum of the spin , some of the nuclei from this lower energy level , can move to the higher energy level by absorbing the nuclei magnetic radiation.	11.455421236514905
So , what i am trying to make you understand , following the simple process where now we just considering the highest in a maximum possible sizes , dimer reacting dimer gives you tetra , tetra reaction with reacting with tetramer gives octa , octa reacting with octamer gives you 16 mar.	8.758261918021446
The same as the chain polymerization and in because you are talking about ionic polymerization in most cases they are leaving and we know that bi molecular term is not possible for ionic polymerization.	10.107343836539648
Sometimes in cationic polymerization you also , if you do a characterization of the polymers you gained at the end of cationic chain polymerization you might get or you might see there is a bimodel distribution on the molecular weight.	10.69511364555134
As soon as the first substrate binds to the enzyme it can react to form the b to form a product or it can split off to a product e.	10.266772946231681
It is not valid for crystalline polymers because you know this , this expression or this approach we are talking about talks about liquid solvent and liquid polymer.	9.331973564298783
So , that you can get narrower and this is the most typical values of p d i you get from a normal polymerization radical polymerization reaction.	8.443401390073747
A detailed analysis or detailed study on the conformation , just like what we do as for identification of the globular structure the tertiary structure of the enzyme , one can study.	11.681303283180073
So , like there is no bias on the incorporation of the two monomers one after one , so there could be other statistical law , which the monomers can follow , but this small example , which actually gives a complete random arrangement of these two monomers.	10.024253503956846
So , this will have highest tendency.	7.659845917144207
Put one of them in excess , so that the molecular weight is controlled if you have some molecular weight in your target and that can also be done by adding small molecules , small amount of monofunctional molecules.	12.067498758180136
Again an example of such catalysis is cleavage of poly peptides by carboxy peptides.	12.14252401446071
So if you , from this expression if you can increase the value of t m , either by increasing the value of del h , and by decreasing del s value.	9.968974904434555
Whenever we have to look at any particular feature of an immobilized enzyme reaction , we have to look into these four effects and try to find an answer to the observed behavior.	10.459611548075653
In this case , your initiator is a halide and you have redox reaction , where you have a q plus halide.	10.18003764471287
A large variety of natural polymers are used by changing one or more of the parameters in the solution.	8.293969901018155
So , there is not heat acumination as a low increase in temperature , so the gel effect does not happen.	9.139001741537284
So , a i b n have t half value of at 50 degree centigrade about 74 hours , whereas 100 degree centigrade , which has a t half of 7.2 minutes; that means if you use a i b n as the initiator , for reaction which you are carrying out at 100 degree centigrade , then your reaction is very fast , it will complete , and all the a i b n , at least half of the a i b n will consumed in 7 minutes , so your you can imagine your reaction is very fast.	8.929182457372885
In general , if we talk about different polymers , if you want to compare the mechanical properties of different polymer in general what happen.	9.268125586424032
So , crystalline polymers , they have different refractive index , in particular perpendicular directions , so they will have different values , they will be birefringent.	9.850048998071731
Now if there is no change in the enthalpy of the system on mixing or when the solute and solvent mix and form a solution , the entropy of mixing delta s m would depend only on the combinatorial entropy.	10.048955207331788
If you are going to measure let us say the value of km or vm , you need an accurate value.	9.543749747750843
So , a polymers are added if talking about linear polymer then the intrinsic viscosity of that polymer is measured in several solvents , several common solvents.	9.179771444610612
And for large expansion it can also shown that , it is a approximately proportional to n to the power 1 over 10, n is the number of bonds , so basically this expansion factor is approximately proportional to the molecular weight to the power 1 by 10, where n is proportional to molecular , the molecular proportion to n , so for large expansion we will use this in future.	9.67563298675872
Here we had highlighted that there are a number of enzyme reactions which although give you lot of benefits , very favorable concepts , in terms of their specificity , in terms of the desired nature of the product they produce in the right stereoisomeric form but still the problem is also in relation to the never specificity gives you a much more problem.	10.528267831279383
One typical example is the hydrolysis of penicillin to 6 - amino penicillinic acid , 6 - apa , which is an intermediate for ampicillin.	11.105864461910404
It has been also seen that when you subject enzyme molecule into anhydrous organic solvent the enzyme becomes very rigid.	9.718822349311573
Ultimately the drug has to reach into the biological fluids , save blood or let s say it has to reach to stomach.	11.205342218388191
It is a head - tail arrangements always preferred almost exclusively over an arrangement like head - head.	9.822758080331486
Because , the concentration of monomer also goes down , concentration on initiator also goes down , but as the concentration initiator goes down faster than the monomer , so effectively the monomer molecular weight increases.	9.309259091249025
Then q would be greater than 5, if they cannot stabilize by resonance them q would be lower so basically q is a measure of resonance stabilization.	10.335183258459175
The most commonly used matrices are beads - the spherical particles and that s why gram or volume and they are packed in a packed bed.	8.445203979870964
So , if you can and if you see that if your ring size increases your del s value is decreasing becoming less and less negative , but if you follow the del g value gibbs free energy value and del h value they are almost having same trend.	9.716794145322108
For example , acrylamide the polymerization in acrylamide in organic solvent , the other polymer type like microsuspension polymerization where the size of the beads are in much smaller micro domain , so the name microsuspension polymers are used.	9.417977218160624
Now you can.	8.783980723520854
The term mild applies to the same feature and because we are talking about the formation of covalent bonds between the matrix and the enzyme molecule it brings in two major considerations.	9.333928213523665
If i take the axis , the carboxylic group , what will land up in.	10.693209261451177
This is an enzyme catalyzed reaction which is used commercially all over the world and particularly 6 - amino pencillanic acid is used as the intermediate for synthesis of ampicillin and today because the use of penicillin as an oral drug has reduced significantly excepting for application . . . . ointment.	10.035583082493106
This course as you know , deals with one of the largest group of biomolecules what we know as enzymes.	10.723897361336647
The copolymers which will form , which will have different monomer content , then the copolymers which form in the beginning or at the beginning.	10.77026767682292
The other stabilizers , like hindered amine light stabilizers , we just talked about , which basically prevent the radical process.	8.622800973306719
Also even as an analytical tool you can use when we want to determine many of the metabolite concentrations using enzymes , the basis of the design of experiment is kinetic parameters.	11.080972898695979
It can be shown that this m is m w and this s square is s square z which is basically z average is radius of gyration.	8.989935462663624
Each a will react with one a will react with one b.	9.813748754534235
This tau term has been defined earlier as v / f; in the case of a packed bed reactor we define tau as ev / f.	9.622299790687144
If you simplify the thiele modulus expressions either for a zero order or a first order reaction it becomes still simpler.	9.084585248139398
So , third characteristic we can talk about and compare the nature of reaction.	8.26982084530109
So , finally , we have this expression and if we consider a poly dispersed polymer coil normally we have the polymer chains are not mono dispersed , they are poly dispersed.	9.972007191615104
So , basically increasing reactivity ratios may not be different.	7.536100365803837
While the major feature of the whole process will include the immobilized enzyme preparation itself but over and above you also need some kind of a hardware , an equipment in which the immobilized enzyme or for that matter even soluble enzyme can play around and catalyze the reaction.	10.221910142771375
So , obviously , this valued percentage , and hence the percentage transmition , we will also depend upon the thickness , and the lambda of the , or the wavelength of the light used.	10.659177057418106
You are taking this pre - polymer putting in a sheet type mold and then finishing the polymerization.	8.703272802467982
This , this reacts , this hydroxylated solvents react very , very fast , you know , very effectively they react with this ionic species and then stop the chain.	9.807471126049958
The pore diffusional resistance is expressed by.	12.629534301342828
Pbm is malic polybutadiene and pu is polyurethane and these are the precursors of certain photocrosslinkable polymers.	12.328705563586386
So , you can write this.	4.338350125461065
How ? nowhere from a polymer is originated.	12.9198922935659
We discussed about the weathering condition with ability , where polymer exports are experienced heavy light and other parameters.	9.242125000493521
Then higher stability both thermal stability and no problems with microbial contamination because the solvent itself will act as a preservative and not allow any microbial contamination to take place and the enzyme can be stored over a long period of time.	8.37210320663564
If the where that interaction is maximum , the maximum swelling happens.	9.594742834219867
It could be simply unfolding; it could be some kind of stretching and it may lead to a totally inactive enzyme preparation or a reduced activity of an enzyme preparation.	10.125946755388876
H is very small , uniform enzyme distribution , plug flow behavior or completely back mix behavior , that means you have one of the extreme fluid dynamics in the reactor system.	9.94392178974719
So , the molecular weight becomes twice , so k is 2 for initiation by electron transfer initiation.	8.198615604602718
Only then it depends on the magnitude of time.	10.057848849918864
Now , iupac suggest that we have , i have indentified this is the repeat unit , constitutional repeat unit in this polymer polyethylene oxide , but according to the seniority you have to write this as this.	10.234689448673246
So , if this happened in normal case , if this bimolecular reaction happen , you get a termination step dead polymer , but in this case because this is reversible , this can again come back and give you back this active radical and inactive radical.	9.847281577478391
Now , if those rubbers or the sealants , rubbers actually gets solvents then there would be leakage or there in that sealing method.	8.856994426413648
This is the example of how initiation is done with electron transfer.	8.009574523906204
So , you can place the other bond here , 180 degree or 90 degree or even 0 degree , there is no , there is no restriction of bond angle , in this case; and as i said , i am just showing a two dimension here a thing , imagine you can think of three dimension as well.	8.70453896781064
In that case the total amount of tracer which has been put in to the reactor will not be equal to sc.	8.817489127105528
Having discussed some of the characteristic features of enzymes in the light of their chemical nature , today we will discuss the functional nature of the enzymes and as most of you are familiar , catalysis is the universal property of enzymes.	9.467010730056783
It could be linear , if the stress strain behavior is linear , it goes from here and come back in the same path.	9.556189477656229
So , these are the example how we can these are the different ways we can induce polymer crystallinity.	7.8646756994765905
Now , copolymers can be different molecular structures.	9.148153039573842
Now known molecular weight can be either m n or m w which you already determined by the absolute techniques.	9.848188128253065
So , with very low conversation to take little time to , so that his the transient non steady state , before the steady state happen.	9.597924858955487
There has to be a common feature by which the immobilized preparation can be characterized so that the purpose of characterization is that the method should be reproducible by anybody.	12.955976248525918
This is quite a highly reactive molecule.	8.515520134281532
The third interesting area which i wanted to talk was bio - organic synthesis using enzymes in micro - aqueous medium.	8.911356784218583
If you put an enzyme molecule into aqueous media , in buffer the molecule in highly mobile.	10.27135531668072
In initiation step , initiator reactive species r is formed , from initiator molecule i , this reactive species then react with a monomer , gives you a chain initiating species.	10.43083635408876
So , the term is used is excluded volume , this is called excluded volume effect , once a space is occupied by a polymer segment , the same space cannot be occupied by another segment , so that is the way we calling the other chains are excluded other portions are excluded from that space we are calling that excluded polymer effect.	10.02009169059437
The role of these molecules is very important in the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions for certain reasons.	9.834873279890038
As i discussed at the last part of my lecture last lecture that delta is between polymer and monomer is basically change in entropy due to the translation motion vibration or rotational entropies and the rotational and vibration entropies of the monomer lost due to polymerization is actually gained in polymer.	10.375819347873868
In many cases even which are now practically understood very clearly this is not true.	9.202654752477203
For example , for generic expression we are using , it can be , it can be shown here and the examples of isopropylene polymerization will be in water , you can write a termination reaction like this.	10.143521918876074
For toluene , it has a very high rayleigh ratio and we need to purify.	12.651240757808841
The chemical re reactivity of the propagating chain in a copolymerization , only depends on the monomer unit present at the end of the growing chain , which means that the chemical reactivity of these propagating chain , will only depend upon the reactivity of the m 1 group.	9.01107244101477
So , one more time , this is this this order will follow for the reactivity of this monomers towards a given radical.	8.80940461858919
This was the major contribution which for a long time was valid until the time another major contribution which came in the enzyme kinetics was by briggs and haldane in 192.	10.995904103521262
This initial reaction rate is considered one of the parameters for determining the concentration of any enzyme sample.	13.231957350944974
So this d is the term and you can also write k 2e0s s0 - s = k m + s.	9.55201518231975
In a same sample , you have mixture of.	11.390237643410542
Within fraction of a minute they simplify the situation of a cardiac failure problem due to blood clot.	12.355383322758039
Now in all the three linear plots which i have discussed that is lineweaver plot , eadie hofste plot as well as the hanes plot again there is one limitation which has been noticed.	10.822658014290262
H * / rt ) the rate enhancement process consists of two different components or the energy of activation consists of enthalpic as well as entropic contribution.	9.806654690057751
Here the bottom one is the whole enzyme molecule and the dotted line represents the active sites.	9.309630030776496
It is a totally different process which , particularly the enzyme substrate complex is a result of a large number of non covalent interactions between enzyme and substrate , hydrogen bonding or vander waal s forces.	8.041605356979323
So , s 2 which is the combinatorial entropy for the polymer molecule is one is not equals to 0; it has significant value.	9.587966278772985
It s basically , is a resolution , how good resolution , you can get , when you going through a plastic material , so if the clarity is less , then the material or the resolution will come down.	10.491220054263248
So , what you need to find out; if you know for experiment or if you from literature in the book , you are fine , you can get and determine experimentally the value for intrinsic viscosity and you can utilize this expression to get the viscosity average molecular weight.	9.446694330262062
And strain is basically is the change in dimension change in dimension divided by the original dimension.	11.426378238828894
Besides the substrates , inhibitors or activators two major environmental parameters which form or which constitute a bulk environment for the enzyme catalyzed reactions are ph and temperature.	9.15426435912933
Which have initially started to make the mess.	14.405990579191704
We also discussed in detail about the relationship between chemical structure , and glass transition temperature.	7.942123061535057
And , as i said that , in most cases for practical purposes , you need a catalyst to increase the reaction rate.	7.696103137340441
Whereas in the case of thorell and chance mechanism this will be a binary complex , this will not be a modified enzyme.	8.333479905291762
In the case of enzymes with low cost even the batch system soluble enzyme may be suitable.	7.852406113687292
So , basically we make a dilute solution of polymer and they mix with a very concentrated solution of the matrix which are typically organic acids , and a small alicut from this mixture is taken , and applied to the mass spectroscopy plate , and it solidifies as the solvent vaporizes.	9.865974125050707
We measure it in terms of half life and the various reasons which cause the loss of stability during operation are enzyme denaturation , the thermal deactivation of the enzyme , adsorption of the inhibitory substances because the feed stream might include certain toxic substances which might inhibit the enzyme activity.	10.069769630540232
So , what i will do , one i will stop for this lecture , and in the next lecture , i will start the discussion of polymer additives , and some of the additives , which are used to basically protect the polymers from this weather conditions , including see uv radiation , and some additives which might use useful or added to polymer , to increase the perform of the polymer.	8.09659689655572
And as decrease in the value of del h which means thermodynamic feasibility will also comes down.	7.392797324725374
Next , we talk about the vinyl families and most important polymer in the vinyl family is poly vinyl chloride as generally synthesized by suspension polymerization batch process.	9.854309270793907
The only care that is taken in designing a drug is that the particular molecule which acts as an inhibitor for a particular toxic substance or let us say for an infection should not be toxic to the human beings.	11.067894249401059
We are talking about this is a ideal elastic behavior.	8.220163573991693
Now , in this case it is a true termination reaction because here you are not forming anything else , we can restart the , or reinitiate the polymerization.	8.176171858801878
One can derive these expressions and get the different types of inhibition pattern.	9.333862039482451
So , k x scattering is proportional to the difference in the electron density and for neutron this is the scattering is due to neutron scattering length density.	9.232310217389246
So these methods can have an advantage that the reversible nature can also be used in some cases where you want to use the drug or a therapeutic agent with the requirement of slow availability over a long period of time.	8.641600030668739
Now , see here radical initiator see radical initiator , now it is unlikely that this will inter act or react with this and ring opening , that is not very feasible.	10.662497293606313
So , i expect that a student should understand the mechanistic difference between chain and step polymerization , if i stop a reaction after some conversion , what you expect in the polymerization medium , how the molecular weight build up with time and so on.	8.870634213832693
You can strain the polymer samples much more.	8.67241847786173
Now , as i said that the existence of the , these numerous confirmation results from the rotational degree of freedom that a single bond allows.	8.295921582954314
Now , obviously , as we discussed we would expects polyethylene to be much less stiff than a polystyrene molecule , so this these are the steric factor and the characteristic ratio , they are higher than polyethylene , pmma has less bulky side group , so it is expected to be lowest , you know having lower lowest stiffness than polystyrene , so it has it has this numbers lower than polystyrene.	11.24380512396822
And this scheme is based on the assumption that the rate constant , rate constant of reaction between a propagating radical p this is a propagating radical p with a monomer , monomer m.	10.830263655238976
Ea will be formed only by two patterns that is k1a , k - 2 and k4 and k1a , k3 and k.	10.717057216735213
If you increase enzyme concentration , the value of vm increases.	9.859901744173857
Now , if you see i am targeting a molecular weight of something which correspondence to an average degrees of polymerization of 10.	8.133302115312254
Sometimes the reaction is so faster , that in a fraction of seconds this polymerization is completed.	13.16411419807548
So , that reaction will be prominent preferred , let us take example and see whether we can grass this.	7.982325442814276
Now , the drop in i is much sharper compared to drop in m concentration of m , which means that x n the average degrees of polymerization or the molecular weight increases with time.	7.981275080919269
Whereas , if the entropy factor is negative than t has to be lower than the theta temperature to have mixing possible.	8.43395951842695
So what we will have , we will have a composition drift , which means the copolymers which form at the beginning they will have different composition , than the copolymers which are forming at the later part of the copolymerization reaction , so is have so you can understand that the monomer content in the copolymers will be different , then the feed ratio at the beginning , and with time the monomer composition will be different , from the beginning , and there will be composition drift.	10.670609896621961
Now , let us talk about the kinetics of or get some , introduce kinetic expression in case of cationic chain polymerization.	5.574600063326192
And as i said the presence of the impurities like voids , bubbles , etcetera may also cause scattering , obviously the refractive index values between , the material polymeric metrics , and the voids of the bubbles will be different , so depending on the size of these voids of bubbles , they will scatter a light.	10.406115891787207
We will study the characterizes process , characterization of process , how after making this polymers what are the ways we will characterize and even with the polymers , which we have learnt for last twenty four lecture.	10.278278430516458
But as it increases to higher substrate concentration the slope tends to increase and the kappm value increases.	9.613533455666268
If you consider p as 1, if you make your p is 1, then x n would be 1 plus r , 1 minus r.	9.288525864410307
They are this phenolic anti oxidants.	8.62918104797421
But for all industrial application the surface excepting for biosensors and things like that which are very specific applications , for industrial catalysis it is used in the form of particles and used with the packed bed.	9.768327712212363
In the case of f curve , the c0 is the maximum concentration and that concentration is reached instantaneously.	8.908131861545336
We will come to the next class , next lecture , but in detail , but just before we go to that quantification , what was , how did we get the x n bar or any polymer mixture.	8.95412399376835
So , that is , it gives us very important parameter which will be using several times in determining the molecular weight , so intrinsic viscosity relates to the intrinsic ability of a polymer , to increase the viscosity of a particular solvent at a given temperature.	9.764349798123414
And this is the point they converge.	9.60592122614013
Obviously , the distribution will be the narrower and the molecular weight will be higher.	8.23138509930406
The only monomers , which are synthesized in commercial scales is butyl rubber.	11.284679205966784
Now if you further cool down , what happened.	6.498961886746338
See , if you start with the pure methyl meta acrylate and do the reactions at 298 degree centigrade , 298 k , at 25 degree centigrade and reaction will proceed , polymerization will proceed till the free concentration or the concentration of the free monomer becomes 10 to the power minus 3 moles per liter , which also means , that you can never complete a reaction , you can never complete 100 percent , entire methyl meta acrylate to the polymer stage because before that there will be stage where equilibrium , where for any temperature where the propagation step and depropagation step are same.	9.762835875953682
We have considered that two of the functional groups on the substrate b and c are able to bind to y and z functional groups.	8.641120207122547
It is such an important component it becomes important to understand how they perform those reactions and how they manage the integrity of whole cell.	9.797366672434318
At least i have some idea that these are the polymers are made by synthesized by step polymerization mechanism and one the most common ways of synthesized i have given examples in today s lecture for quite a few.	11.204494290825394
There is a reduction but in the internal porous structure the substrate concentration may undergo also a gradient.	10.490886227791819
So , this is example where we showed that the proton nmr can be useful to get information about polymer microstructure.	7.836993530305536
Now , let us begin just recapping few minutes what we discussed in last class or last lecture.	6.7271806978486
This is reaction progress in hours.	8.907413365905995
So , to have a crystal , say for example , if i want to make a crystal , either these polymer chains should arrange in order or they can , a single polymer chain can fold like this and can make a order.	8.705975502362413
We look into the basic factors that provide the catalytic efficiency.	10.529875097317566
Right . diazonium derivative will have n triple bond n.	10.58779577238321
Methods available for choice is much broader compared to using enzymes where the stability of the enzymes become a key issue.	12.795509501552548
And till there is no mechanism , you know , which has been which has been accepted by all the chemists , scientists working in this field.	12.634239575294272
The corresponding energy of activation for this reaction without any catalyst is 18,000 kcal . mole - 1 as against in the presence of colloidal platinum as catalyst it is 11,700 and for the catalase it is 550.	11.75421216291176
On heating , it will become fluid and melt it and you give them a proper shape and cool them.	10.984697945241892
Now , i can write few thermodynamic expressions.	7.336344139226289
Then you should know the strategies if you want to have some functional group at the end of the polymers both side , then you should use the monomers containing that functional groups in higher amount and the ratio should be according to your target.	9.381534919593486
You can extend this in 3 - d and have this as a brass polymer where you have a backbone , two dimension and these brasses are hanging from the base.	10.889382669423627
So , which means that if we have bulky side groups , the polymer chains becomes more stiff.	8.6178966545691
Sensitive or carriers which can go undergo lot of attrition during use the cstr becomes a sort of a disadvantageous system because if the carrier particles get disintegrated during use it will involve the loss of enzyme.	10.50097686899362
For example you have two binding sites.	6.692065635917729
If the chain has same molecular weight but lower v h lower size for more compact coil which we can imagine for a applicable or which we will get for a branched polymer.	10.19627802068884
But basic enzymes can be classified and each of this class is also characterized in sub classes.	11.433942942819703
So , in effect , you basically fix or you you basically remain or maintain the feed ratio , the monomer of m 1 and m 2 unchanged during the inter polymerization so that the copolymer composition also does not change during the inter polymerization.	9.324408724083444
I just showed one example in in last page of one type of stressed in curve is basically capture everything , all the possible deformation of terminologies.	10.401842791008217
If you have long plastizing side group , then obviously free volume goes up , and t g goes down.	8.29170274226564
If you are able to prepare an immobilize enzyme preparation with a very high enzyme loading that means the catalytic rate is very high.	7.175656441492253
In a couple of minutes you get a polymeric network of chains.	9.279993972737444
Even the side products formed by action of water usually most of the organic chemists consider water for organic chemical reactions as the culprit because it can lead to variety of side products.	10.91347179094029
To take care of all these desirable features of carrier the properties that you look in a carrier are chemical composition , specific surface area that means surface area per unit weight of the carrier , particle size and ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups mainly to achieve a very high degree of loading because one has to choose all the functional group of the enzyme molecule for coupling and therefore hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups on the carrier and finally the cost.	9.807443544093928
That means you take a single batch performance data; take the maximum conversion at different times of reaction.	7.919702839977186
If you substitute the value of eab you get e0 k1k3k2k4 a . .	11.648750919066941
It is reduced and if it is less stable at the alkaline ph , then even at the higher ph the enzyme particle may show higher ph stability.	9.358143095023882
So , you are finding the probability of , this is the probability distribution function.	8.327112691205807
So , if i want to rank different monomers , i have to rank according to their ability to stabilize.	8.625298951122785
These are the four kinetic parameters unlike in the case of a single substrate reaction where we are concerned only with two kinetic parameters km and vm.	7.518298521250619
So , your trans product is become more dominating than or in comparison to the case where there was no substitution.	8.805421310941101
We have one major side reaction is which is present in most of the polymerization step.	9.873103505259362
A is the native enzyme , b is the same enzyme chymotrypsin immobilized on ethylene maleicanhydride copolymer which is polyanionic and the phase shift is towards the alkaline side.	10.408420315335569
What is an enzyme electrode.	11.347075313847697
We have discussed in length about cation polymerization or an anionic polymerization of carbon carbon double bond.	7.540595795580491
Uncompetitive cases are rare and as i mentioned earlier also in most cases the inhibition patterns are usually either competitive or non competitive.	10.891873644234808
What about the fate of that 5 percent monomers which got converted , no which got reacted.	9.815433832557286
You get a mixture of l - amino acid and d - acyl amino acid.	7.1186443738058856
If they are branched , they cannot align all that time.	8.757555934826485
Instead of the possibility of using only in soluble mode in a batch reactor you can use in a variety of application modes.	11.358803750583695
How do you write them in terms of nomenclature , if you make say copolymer with styrene and acylonitrile.	12.282077933274337
L is an organic which basically complex with this copper salt , so that the copper salt remain insoluble , remain soluble in the organic solvent.	9.239839127547222
So , these all are same; k p 1, k p 2, k p n , these are all same.	7.063260639927796
In practice it may not be actually like a cylindrical pore but just to simplify a geometric similarity and to analyze it we are just assuming as cylindrical pore and then instead of taking molecular diffusivity we consider effective diffusivity which takes care of the random nature of the pores.	10.360722439161997
So , this will clearly give you understanding that in case of step growth polymerization you can have the high molecular weight which is the practical polymer , polymers , which is useable polymers can be achieved only when the conversion is quite high , very high more than 98 percent and so.	10.519236150814121
M v and m w are very close to each other.	7.464999737338653
But based on the reactor performance the choice remains between use of a cstr and a pfr and here i have given a summary of the reactor performance equations for cstr and pfr and three different kinetic designs.	11.676927473732617
Now , that is not applicable for monomers like methacrylates where this hydrogen is absent , but methacrylates actually can participate in several side reactions.	8.152607483327335
And look at the value , you will know that this is the more stable radical then this secondary radical then this one then this and in this case because again this is a primary radical.	11.60726191679684
That means the enzyme reactor system becomes more and more controlled by diffusional limitations and when the enzyme loading is less the diffusional limitations are less.	8.042704332745807
If you think about the side reaction , that intra - molecular cyclization reaction , which is discussed here and now fortunately , the activation energy for this reaction , activation for only for this reaction is higher compared to the normal propagation reaction.	8.958253576997494
It is the number of molecules having in mar.	7.391248418820542
The condition implying the non - existence of the term , in significant quantities of eab and direct conversion of ea into ey although it is via eab , the complex eab being not very stable , means that k3 is much , much greater than k.	10.297800114141557
So , with the change in the chemical environment around nuclei , the effective magnetic field the nuclei experience will change , and hence the radiation the lambda at which it absorbs.	9.303548939419732
Whereas , in case of polymers , if you do 90 percent , in step growth polymers we have a 90 percent conversion; p is 0.9, then this gives you 10; x n is 1.	10.81018744397301
So , depends on the method depends on the monomers and the choice of solvent , but this are the typical values of the different rate constant and rates.	10.557910219819384
Because , this this no specific interaction between this two polymer , their entropy of mixing is not negative and because of their high polymer their high molecular weight then tropy of mixing is not contributing enough to the energy of mixing so , they form immiscible blends.	10.952920523858335
As we see , we have seen now from this discussion , that not every monomer can be polymerized by anionically and there is a set of polymer , a set of monomers , which can be polymerized anionically.	10.299504374082336
This today is probably not a very perfect statement because a number of enzymes have been shown to function even in a non aqueous environment or in other words more accurately micro aqueous environment where you require a very small concentration of water , rest of the bulk environment will be replaced by an organic solvent and that can give us a whole new range of chemical reactions which can be carried out using the enzymes and biocatalyst particularly a transition from hydrolysis to synthesis and many of these reactions have become commercially viable today.	10.200212070633423
So , what i am trying; with this example , what i am trying to convince you that , may be the average remain same in two cases; in the first case , there was 25 years 20 50 students , and in this case , you have replaced 4 student with 4 another set of person.	8.49680568114799
Then the choice of carrier and in the choice of carrier the regeneration of the carrier is also associated.	9.249834313766126
So , basically the root mean square end - to - end distance for bond angle restricted chain would be nearly about 1 4th times , 1.4 times of the freely rotating chains rms end - to - end distance.	5.969156246052878
And in last lecture we discussed mainly mechanical properties , the stressed in behavior in tensile testing.	9.701418404811145
So , total mass will be given by total summation of all the molecules divided by total number of moles , number of molecules in this case , it is a moles.	8.891079855373603
One is that the scientist wanted to apply some of the enzymes for industrial processing and obviously for industrial processing you need certain operational advantages the major disadvantages in the case of the enzymes is the restriction in the best mode of processing , the stability , some of the physico chemical properties in respect of ph optimum , temperature optimum , substrate specificity and they could all be taken care for industrial processing.	10.405768560804812
Normally we take an ordinary particle , a spherical particle where the pores are very uniform; say for example you have a sphere where the pores are identical , for example control pore glass then the path of diffusion is linear and of the same dimensions.	11.024516053115368
Unconventionally one can also make all these conditions feasible that means you can localize the enzyme in a defined area of space that is in an ultra filtration cell.	10.865227237416342
So , that is the reason why you always get a a little lower to . .. . . so , we will come back and start with and repeat this thermionic factor and a little bit , and then start the kinetic factor , and also talk about reaction conditions which defers the cyclic formation which is responsible for cyclic formation.	8.000150023277625
It will be something like this because below this temperature the rate of polymerization is higher and then the depolymerization becomes significant and at this temperature , which is , t s , t c , the net polymerization is .	10.00918000139533
So , you are now convinced or you understand this understood this concept.	8.01702216858405
Ks one can develop the expression to write the differential and equate it to zero and that will end up in the substrate concentration for the maximum reaction velocity that is the maxima.	12.1395615038364
Before taking of the final design or analysis of the reactor system one need to look at the reactor performance equation based on actual reaction kinetics which is applicable and in this case i can site you the reference.	10.648489284128003
So , that 3 percent transparence is lost due to , presence of scatterer , and this value is for lambda around 380 diameters to 110 meter; say lambda changes , beyond that this value , might change.	9.790439673009123
Also , it is done by either by taking one of the bi functional or poly functional monomers in excess or mono functional monomer which is termed as chains topper added externally , so that we can control the chain length you know target.	11.611721488129982
The confirmation of that monomer will determine the resulting polymer chain and between these two , the transoid structure is a much stable structure compared with cisoid structure.	11.184039181606666
H + / kb e = ka . eh / h + this is based on the equilibrium dissociation of the three species.	10.477546160684874
The second category is plug flow reactors.	6.955902244389478
By real i mean that you cannot recover , after the immobilization , the original enzyme activity by physical interventions.	12.273970191532673
That means even for certain reasons if you want to use cstr ph control is a requirement and we are obliged to use cstr , then it is always advisable only to use if the fraction of conversion required is not very high.	8.519372217513514
Before we go into the reactor performance of different types of reactor for the immobilized enzyme systems , we cannot normally consider all the parameters like non - ideal fluid dynamics , the mass transfer constraints and along with the biochemical reaction we cannot really combine at one stage.	10.504921340588934
But otherwise at low substrate concentration that will be some where in between zero and that value.	9.503055485570279
So , basically we need to plot this weight fraction distribution against molecular weight to integrate this which will give us m n.	8.652946354919424
One of the result reports the km value of the immobilized glucoamylase on different substrates : soluble starch , amylopectin , amylose and maltose; four different substrates which can be acted upon by glucoamylase or amyloglucosidase.	10.396566372865646
The other type of redox initiator , are the example of redox initiator is , per sulfate and di amine plus di amine , again a combination of redox reducing and oxidizing agents.	10.005035259967718
Now , if you can remove you can do the reaction once again remembering all the impurities and still if you can get or you do not get the higher molecular weight , then what you need to look for is the structure for initiator and the monomers solvent.	10.156521827240164
Just imagine , these three are the different polymer chains in melt , then tangled.	12.453971023309329
One is because of the covalent bond formation the immobilized enzyme preparation is very , very stable.	9.018732800849314
And once the polymerization is complete you can just filter out and get the final polymers in a beads form.	9.525911311405467
This structure again folds itself into a globular form as a result of disulphide bridges.	11.372236960621384
That means kidney is probably one of the excellent examples of a filtration system , highly specific filtration system in the body.	9.147745964142763
And , also we will see that another conditions required for this type of polymerization to make high molecular weight , is that the two functional groups has to be present , so , s symmetric amount; that means , the ratio of nh 2 o group and coh groups has to be 1 isto 1; that is another requirement.	11.035762351349304
Then , what happen on that has to happen.	8.56476227962778
Therefore the use of immobilized cells provides a very viable alternative.	9.385552952878088
They are steric problem.	8.522878201852889
K1k2k3.e0.a . b v = k - 1k3 + k2k 3 b + k1k3 a + a . b that is the final expression for thorell and chance mechanism and therefore one can go into such a mechanism and get rate expression.	9.58729426958312
In practice , we actually do not reach to the equilibrium because some of heats of the condensation of the droplets , i should get dissipated on thermistor and the solvent stream.	9.708517029001639
Now , it will be interesting to see what is the value for t c when you start with the pure monomer.	8.52510491042952
If you compare , give one example here.	7.765317512854104
Now , case 1 k to k p and k transfer transfers much lower than the propagation so what happen , what is the effect on rate of polymerization.	7.838413604155973
That is the plus point.	7.778470431285519
So , if you talk about the compare ring size , then 6, 14 and larger are the more stable rings.	7.88008618800856
You know packaging films you have seen probably that when you stretch at the beginning , it takes a little difficult.	10.663056264886059
So the total fraction f2 is well mixed and so ( 1 - f2 ) . v is the dead zone.	9.636393637709494
So , basically even 1 percent by weight presence of water impurities is decreasing your determine m n by several factor which means we must be very careful about the impurities; specially the low molecular impurities while determination of number average molecular weight because they have a very detrimental effect in the value we get from the number average molecular weight determination.	9.328952375144604
This is in the case of methionine and similar analysis applies to almost all amino acids.	9.22768791056964
So , what is done.	4.925751456375061
If suppose the substrate is also negatively charged the reverse might happen.	8.282847034617143
That is the perception that means their structural confirmation in which they are catalytically active is functional only in aqueous medium.	8.457239037332515
So , we can rearrange this.	5.705952423593951
Almost 40 60 % loss of activity is a very common feature in covalently immobilized preparation.	10.30819714567174
And this now is a active center.	8.511957225323524
In that case the assumption by hill was that most of the enzyme will exist in the form of esn.	8.575280244497467
Entrapment within a gel fortunately does not involve the amino acids of the enzyme protein and therefore the chances of any conformational change during gel entrapment are minimum.	12.460552877059126
In this case , you can , r 1 is as we said k 1 by k 2 by , and r 2 is k 2 2 by k 2 1, obviously in both the monomer m 1 m 2, there is no tendency to homopolimerise , so they there will only form copolymer.	9.463343046501063
So , that ensures if you can bring down the conception of this , that ensures that the termination reaction is much low or if is basically insignificant.	9.924075568928156
This in the case of a small ligand is not a constant.	9.629330816715907
Now , for all these reasons , as i said in the very beginning , that doing or carrying out this cationic chain polymerization in large scale industrial scenario is very difficult , that is why , this cationic chain polymerization are not practiced commercially for many monomers.	9.05767714065222
What is the probability , is the probability given by the rates rate of propagation divided by total rates which is summation of propagation plus termination plus transfer.	10.708117197334225
This was originally developed by british group barker , emery and novais , one of the references i have sited here , in seventy one.	9.924944885028193
So , basically if you find out , or if you measure the t gs or deputed a defensive thermal kilometric , which will just stop in a minute.	8.063143317207555
For any enzyme to be produced in large quantity you need to identify a biological system which can produce the enzyme.	9.819027706482105
And at the same time you can increase the polymerization rate , which is not happened in earlier case , where if you increase the initiation rate the polymer molecular weight comes down at the same , where the polymerization rate goes up.	9.197129891053443
This residence time distribution is usually determined in the experimental reactors by what we know as stimulus response techniques.	9.260497962710174
So , as usual the trans product will be dominated.	7.335267589663911
Very often it might happen that initially the binding sites may be identical and they are free , free for the substrate to bind to any one of them.	9.977964811424874
The yield of the immobilization is defined as r = ei / e0 - er very often there is confusion in reporting these terms and that s why i have tried to put them in the form of an expression.	9.766651717437417
In the case of internal pore diffusion a steady state analysis can be made.	7.407816952383488
Now what will be the s accommodated interval for the solvent.	7.808135747437628
They all follow a combination of these mechanisms and the contributions made by each of these mechanisms will vary from enzyme to enzyme and if more than one mechanism is employed to reduce the energy of activation , the enzyme will be able to perform better catalysis in a more efficient way.	9.720507284784903
Now , there is a second strategy we discussed.	7.246341179100712
And as i said that , i will be mainly i will be discussing the mechanical properties in in details , basic some basic terms in , when you talk about mechanical properties , stress you know that , it is force divided by the area upon which the force acts.	10.264066482345742
It can only be possible if there are side reactions which are producing smaller molecules in excess.	10.841448727879962
This was originally proposed by natta himself.	9.833369974005747
We are just , to make it general , we are using this expression.	9.4849858867698
So , the intrinsic viscosity would be smaller as a becomes smaller.	8.111993673427563
So , basically in this case , this has the least ability to stabilize a radical.	6.311902878955575
So , we can write minus psi 1 by theta by t half minus chi.	7.700223445389831
So , that is this common term that is why this common term is appearing.	8.019161726718654
If you consider this example , when x is 8; that means polyethylene t m is 137 to 146 degree.	8.359921151895591
A combination of all these effects underlies all enzymatic catalysis.	9.706285570882114
Now , whatever vibrational , rotational entropy is lost by the monomers is actually gained by the polymer.	8.15634610560462
A major application of immobilized cells has been in isomerisation of glucose to fructose and the process is only techno economically viable because it can be used in the form of immobilized cells.	9.454767921782269
Similarly , the other test like dynamic mechanical test , fatigue test , hardness , abrasion resistance and these are all , within what this test mean are written here.	9.557831302911557
It is inverse of.	8.621582123705785
By allosteric manner i mean that substrate binding process in case of those enzymes is co - operative in nature and they do not exhibit the typical hyperbolic kinetics rather they exhibit sigmoidal kinetics.	11.880713683792008
They are just generalized rules.	8.360004908465772
For example when substrate concentration is much , much smaller than k m , reactor performance becomes - k m ln ( 1 - x ) = k 2e0t when s0 is much , much greater than k m that is zero order regime.	5.960096158445329
The activity or the loading of the enzyme on to the carrier must be very high , the higher you can make and that will require a large number of sites for binding of the enzyme on to the carrier.	8.717409529884277
So unless we do not know how polymers behave in solution , we will not be able to understand how polymer characterization is done.	10.535204863300201
Now , you know for organic chemistry knowledge , what is the stability of differing , what is the strain.	10.976077926781736
That is because of you if you have say polymer , a monomer like this where you have substituted one two substituted and you have a radical , if radical approaching this double bond which gets very restricted because of this substitutions.	11.08266189120226
So , you do not want your material rubber material to swell in that particular gasoline or liquid fuels.	8.212137891074235
If you can recollect our discussion in the definition of radius of gyration , these are very close.	9.585361310538792
In almost all cases of the immobilized preparation the storage stability has noted to be higher in terms of its half life.	11.499351425731295
If you have monomers like aa type or bb type , then you have the intra molecular reaction cyclization in monomers.	9.600132471506956
For example , like lithium.	6.790918568978796
We we listen everywhere about the polymers , but what are polymers.	10.924966833709393
Where , in case of cross linking , material with cross linking , the the material the less modulus can goes up further with cross linking.	9.658311225341173
For example , nylon has nitrogen , oxygen along with carbon.	8.415196369843365
And we have surfactant , now surfactants act as a dispersant stabilizer of the large monomer droplets will come to that , and it also act as a solubilizer of the monomers molecules in it is core.	10.894378807655105
The bond can freely rotate and thereby can give rise to hydrogen bonding between the different amino acid residues in the chain and constitute the subsequent structural organization of the macromolecule.	10.237520400812597
In fact optimum temperature should be higher than entrapment if it is solely by temperature gradient.	10.334182936552843
Now from there , we can write 1 by t c; for large x , we can write one by t c is one by theta one plus b b is b .	10.761944090413648
Now if it continuing , a term , a time will come when these polymer samples undergo melting , and you get a peak correspondence to the melting of the polymer , so you get a curve like this.	8.881958655124382
You can actually deep that plastic material , in a liquid or similar refractive index.	10.035430806730139
It s only convenient.	10.369043349019803
There are large variety of covalent bond formation methods available in literature.	8.641218524165994
So , this assumption which we made for ideal solution is not valid here; the sizes are solvent molecules and solute molecules.	8.823435592575505
We call that as a dispersion polymerization.	8.148067581591445
That means you don t get a particulate matter.	7.592189446269473
So far we have not considered the inhibition patterns.	7.683993096415654
The recovery has improved so per unit cost as a result of raw material consumption has decreased.	10.071002302734902
So , now , let us discuss transfer reaction so if i have a propagating radical m n dot.	6.950720650685591
This is your d - amino acid.	6.426573208756709
The magnitude of the deactivation constant will be a function of temperature.	7.444857170165663
So if i have a anionic species , reacting with this monomer , it will form for example; say c h .	9.755829669333714
So , this the ir spectra , for it is not very special in the sense , that it is same as the that the use of ir in detecting the chemical chemical structure of polymer molecules is similar to the application of ir for small organic molecules.	9.590837625866524
And briefly we will touch upon the energetics of this anionic chain polymerization , and then in the end we will talk about this , a few practical considerations for anionic chain polymerization , both cationic and anionic.	10.224706460436174
For example if you require a very stringent ph control or a temperature control or addition of a secondary substrate at a different period other than the beginning of the reaction then batch reactor provides you operational convenience; a better term would be the use of batch reactor is based on certain operational conveniences.	10.30584957034859
So , i can write now , this is a dead chain , so the chain gets terminated and this is a weak nucleophile , as we discussed earlier.	9.54802783899415
If we talk about the utility of conversion for an organic chemist which deals with the small molecules in 98 percent conversion may be good enough , but for a polymer chemist , 98 percent conversion might give you only a degree of polymerization of 5.	9.011035142866037
So , we found the quantity of relations between the amount of condensate present at the end of the reaction with the degrees of polymerization in that along with its relational equilibrium constant , and we have seen that unless we have a quite high value of equilibrium constant , we have to go down the residual value of the condensate to a very low level to build a higher molecular weight.	9.384129117462875
Now , between then comes a competition for same solvent two monomers because this is donor it will have more reacting transfer reaction tendency with acrylonitrile.	10.123486174851173
And , now , n is the monomers present.	9.582515063745523
So , as soon as this radical generates , they undergo polymerization reaction and these two reactions n m dot plus m n dot did undergo by molecular reaction forming either m n m plus n depending upon which type of termination reaction they are undergoing.	9.722914588907713
Polymers are also can be procute though , very very less quantity from natural resources.	10.143895545414257
So , here we detect the scattering from very small volume at very small time intervals; this is what we do; delta t which varies from microseconds to milliseconds and then correlate the scattering intensity fluctuations with time.	9.011560933376867
In the case of zero order regime there is no complication whatever is the fractional conversion the relative quantity required are identical; the same space time.	7.4288747934798804
When you make a high molecular weight polymer , then your equilibrium conversion has to be 0.995 which means you have to look at the number of k , value of k which is at the order of 10 to .	10.839460558273803
So , in terms uv - visible , basics of uv - visible spectra , it is basically electronic transitions from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital , homo and lumo.	9.921639744205798
Now , what does it mean.	3.541862716254567
E even in the case of an uninhibited reaction the relative performance of pfr as the fractional conversion increases is superior.	10.716252926882811
Now this case; obviously this equation , predicates the curve , a curve below the straight line , with composition.	9.330579349428424
And if we increase the chain both sides long enough , it will make polypropylene but they do not mix mix , they do not make miscible blend.	8.759040941680421
S * from second law of thermodynamics.	11.031736891388656
That is a true vm.	7.924583112584007
What is present in maximum , it corresponds to the polymer chain which is having average degrees of polymers.	9.098693238522769
They are very selective; for example if i take a specific example of styrene and acrylonitride.	9.42262920069876
Now , once you form the trimer , the options increases.	6.978079072929624
Similarly it can also react with histidine group.	8.043559350575002
That is the residence time and this if in all cases same as in the case of a space time then it should be an ideal reactor.	8.788382365409685
Now , what are the different ways we can synthesize the polymers.	4.880186380226143
We had started the discussion on light scattering by which we can determine the weight average molecular weight of a polymer sample.	7.736750703853417
Now , what we are going to discuss next is the q and e scheme.	7.099271903607304
Now if you define t half , where a time , where i is i 0 by 2, if you define t half as the time , where the concentration of initiator has halved , then you can write t half is , can put i is i 0 by 2, you can get this.	9.278981900149372
So , if the side chain molecular weight goes up or size goes up , the t g grows some.	8.601682894086869
So finally , whatever crystalline material we have , that is non - equilibrium microstructures.	12.290845547808162
Another feature is mild conditions and that will apply to most of the immobilization methods and also to adsorption.	11.030766741666646
The transducer measures the potential difference between a reference and sensing electrode.	10.853223083693386
The very condition can be taken from these various parameters.	10.679163089172533
In the last lecture we found , that the value of m dot in case of a thermally induced polymerization , is given by f k d i by k t to the power half.	8.039658290057258
So the molar ratio of m 1 and m 2, in the copolymer at any instance , is given by d m 1, because this is the rate at which , they are getting consumed , during the reaction.	7.949640706892007
All these factors that i have listed here can be considered mainly under two categories.	10.393278255362958
When we study the enzyme reaction rate as the function of ph we get a variety of profiles.	11.228627229801447
Because , if there are impurities in the monomer , they will be carried over to the polymers and they are very detrimental for the use of the polymers.	9.412382793306461
Therefore the carrier which we choose should be insoluble in the reaction environment and that is a major requirement.	10.748828007936611
Now , which is in practical , in a polymer chain or any chemical chain will not be , will not have this type of arrangement.	11.40641174061297
Now , this double bond are available to react radically or some other chain polymerization mechanism by itself alone , are you can add a another monomers like styrene or mma methyl methacrylate and then copolymerized with and form a cross link.	9.85619778876763
The difference between michaelis and menten kinetics and that proposed by briggs and haldane lies in the fact that in the case of michaelis kinetics they proposed the dissociation constant k - 1 / k1 ( k - 1 + k2 / k1 ) they named as this parameter ( k - 1 + k2 / k1 ) as michaelis menten constant in honour of michaelis and menten to recognize their contribution because bulk of the ideas they got in the whole analysis from the michaelis and menten assumptions.	8.760407866628961
First point to be noted is that the cost of the production of the product has come down to 59 % , whatever was the original cost 100 % of the l - amino acid.	10.37681022654299
Now , if these chains are below the glass transient temperature , that means they do not have any flexibility in the temperature operation , then you cannot stretch the polymer because they do not have any flexibility in the thermal motion you talking about.	8.772050791778392
From this expression you can determine the equilibrium constant for the reaction.	8.888503556935621
We talking about deformation of polymer material , that this deformation can be bring about in a polymer material in different ways.	11.053981711119329
So now , we have n 0 number of cells and n 0 number of molecules and each size of this cell is equal to the size of one molecule.	8.742440233857552
The enzyme binds to the substrates a and b , forms eab and this process also undergoes energy of activation.	7.233482136572424
There might be some confusion about ka and k a.	6.959851323236895
So , polymer will build , but it is not always possible or it is almost impossible for engineering design to take out every possible condensate , you know all the 100 percent with condensate.	9.588616714502459
Is the ratio of the kinetic parameters to the diffusional parameters which is defined as.	10.108171138099456
This is a pure amorphous polymers so , the drop in elastic modulus or modulus after t g and this is a rubber with cross linking.	11.14318325895208
Phi 2 is given by x n 2 n 1 plus x n .	8.61107273037759
So all that information must be provided in the methods of preparation.	8.480536292740075
Now , we must remember that it is very difficult to change only one of these parameters , just only one parameter; because changing one parameter , these are all interlinked sometime.	9.664540805657545
In living cell also the enzyme is entrapped through a semi permeable membrane which does not allow the enzyme molecules to pass through and some of the product molecules from the cell also are usually ripped off.	11.483244541445556
This is identical to the generalized rate expression proposed by alberty.	10.279059995631314
Experimental sciences will take years together to come out with those conclusions which can be brought in by many of the computational programs.	13.996206200531923
Now , this is where we left in the last lecture.	4.859555175342868
We took as our model the polyesterification reaction and this is the reaction we followed and finally , what we arrived at is as follows.	12.352143394806726
Similarly when both the binding sites are occupied , the product formation rate will be twice the kp because then it can go either to se or es , there is no difference.	10.316365581310537
Also many of the applications in beginning if you recall what i said that there are few applications or some applications where , though in not majority , a minor application of polymers where polymers are used in solution; for example , eye drop where the water solvable suppose active polymers are used , detergents and there are several applications where you will find that polymers are added in solution.	11.309839883659917
Now , what we will do in next lecture is , we will take this , this two expression , and start from there in the next lecture.	7.125775492150821
So , what we can do.	4.227789358038872
So delta s is always positive , neighbor is not equal to zero , due to difference in heat capacity of sample , and the reference , to keep.	10.197895589570495
So , we consider this general reaction.	5.707010626455196
If you take a case like acrylonitrile and butadiene , then this is this is a higher number.	9.289736059596073
Now , let us go back and look at this thermal initiator , which is the most common; r p is given by this , which means rate of polymerization is directly proportional to the concentration of monomer; and , it is actually directly proportional to the square root of the concentration of initiator.	7.740916802158202
But there are systems reported in which they are on the tube walls.	10.176752029449489
So , as we had seen in earlier lectures that; we write this step wise reaction to describe a step growth polymers , or general you can write m r plus m r , gives you n plus m , m r.	9.205891278247783
At high substrate concentration the system should not behave as a diffusion limited system because at higher temperatures the reaction rate is higher and the diffusional limitation was established.	10.976137711753665
When you immobilize the enzyme on to a solid matrix , let us say a polymeric matrix , it could be hydrophilic or hydrophobic matrix you generate an interphase with the bulk medium and the polymeric matrix is surrounding the water layer which is maintained during the reaction.	8.498465585820043
And same as the radius of gyration , most cases we have now tetrahedral bond angle is 109.5 degree in that case , this factor comes out 1.4 times.	10.63917953786979
I like you to concentrate on at least three major phrases built in , in this definition.	10.473562432324274
Just to illustrate a little more detail on the transport behavior consider a typical spherical particle with an external film shown here.	8.695201579874135
And i just i will give you few guide line in the deep something goes wrong in spite of doing your best possible way; now what are the things to look for and let us look one by one.	10.518413754457384
And if this temperature , rate of polymerization or rate of propagation increases with temperature.	9.02742287363318
Therefore we can substitute the value eh e0 = eh { 1 + ka / h + + h / kb + s / km } from this if we put the expression in the term for ehs ehs = e0.s / km { 1 + ka / h + + h / kb + s / km } or reaction velocity will be v = k [ ehs ] that is the concentration of the enzyme substrate complex which has bound the doubly ionized enzyme complex.	7.539348208944189
X and y could be different also.	10.759124374592306
So it is functional.	8.529245833816658
So if you start , daily will start somewhere and remain same , as long as the heat capacity of the sample remains same.	8.473593098605937
Now , in last slide we saw aliphatic diamine and aliphatic diacids , now we want to move to the aliphatic diamines and aliphatic diester or diacid chloride in this case.	9.456188303032013
Thermo - couple determines the temperatures of sample , and t r thermo - couple determine the temperature of the reference there is a gas inlet , typically with your experiments in inner atmospheric , so they is a gas inlet and a gas outlet.	12.02883180835452
Obviously , if there is a particle present in the medium , whose refractive indices is same as the polymer refractive index , then there will not be any scattering happening.	9.893085085102586
If you look at the equation number two here for the cstr and the equation for the zero order regime here in the case of the pfr , they are identical.	8.332469311368701
And another way of making the pet is instead of taking dimethyl terephthalate , you can start with terephthalicacid and make first this an then follow the same process.	10.43774425738431
You will find out in later discussion , that in case of cationic there are other ways , which are likely like chain transfer reactions , but in case of anionic it is comfortably easy to make polymerization , leaving chain polymerization.	9.879092236386086
So , the corresponding stress is the yield stress and corresponding strain is the yield strain and on subsequent applying subsequent stress , subsequent straining , sometimes at the end , the stress might go a further thus because , strain hardening technique takes place , the chains are already stretched.	9.825455394881319
Let us say an ultra filtration cell in which the molecular weight cut off of the membrane is such that the enzyme is not allowed to pass through and retained as the retentate whereas the unconverted substrate and the product formed is passed through a membrane and can be collected.	10.528391695270475
T and this is the fraction edt.	14.13111245755827
And we have found that to be true as well what we did not , which we did not consider is that giving polymer reaction , we know that is a h o thermic reaction.	10.447860414708662
So , you can make block of polymers of functional polymers at the end of the reaction , and in this case unlike a linear polymerization of the vinyl molecules , polymerization de polymerization equilibrium is very important.	7.868224752263533
But because you are ultimately here reducing the concentration let us say from hundred milli molar to an extent of about seventy milli molar which means thirty milli molar concentration has been reduced which means that in a nad concentration of let us say ten milli molar , seven hundred cycles have taken place.	10.587856448825269
That is the reaction rate.	5.668354144011248
So , if you can stop the side reactions , which includes the chain transfer reaction , then you can actually make this chain alive or this polymerization could be living polymerization and that is especially true for anionic polymerization.	8.032647313815572
It is above the x in bar and this is again with increasing p.	10.00604226996458
Under acidic conditions you get a diazonium derivative.	13.359212039863776
That is always allowed.	10.663763659649055
The mean substrate concentration in the reactor will be given by this.	6.309547237349774
A variety of methods that are available in literature for covalent binding will fall into one of these three categories.	10.132319364441699
So , if you change the composition; obviously , the temperature at which the two phase or the precipitation starts will vary.	7.747141803324679
Then , this chain transfer can happen to this and the chain can get terminated.	8.45113130742107
Then we have a number of enzymes which show stereo chemical specificity.	9.550806341376129
Kes and kei will have definite magnitude.	11.661233425584104
So , in the if the application required that you the polymer will should be present at this high temperature.	8.365060245121912
These polarity effects actually help them to form copolymer.	10.03414071006501
Now again this bond this bond they can fully rotate.	9.975271995381274
Here the figures are given under certain experimental conditions in the literature and under which depending on the diffusion limitation or the loading of the enzyme on the carrier will dictate the final activation energy parameter.	10.072028253099363
The most easy simple and least ambiguous method of naming polymers is from its source , from source that means if you have a polystyrene , this is styrene.	10.685222498246757
There may be another possibility , where on this high energy radiation , is can capture a electron and form a radical anion; and these radical anion can dissociate into a radical anion , and which again gives away electron to form a radical.	10.513157061492027
Very often we might make a judgement that the energy which has gone into enzyme substrate binding is not a part of activation energy , is not required for catalytic process , for activation energy to be equalized.	10.64256832719031
It is not necessary that there will be always one negatively charged and one positively charged amino acid residue.	9.177241358174905
But in actual term because this has a definite volume you cannot put on the same paper , these two cannot intersect on the plane of paper , there would be it has to expand , because this has volume.	10.618340940159227
Once we find the specificity then we can propose hypothesis or mechanisms by which the stereo specificity can be explained.	12.793042574183266
These are clays , which are exfoliated in the matrix.	9.351913062606075
So , the pet molecule polyethylene terephthalete we have to write according to the seniority , the constitutional repeat unit like this and iupac name accordingly would be poly oxy ethylene oxy , this is tere phthaloyl.	10.752748180903598
So , here to build a molecular weight , if i consider this same as h 2 o , case in last line in the last page , this k is .	8.774661182780989
Then you come to office by a car or a bus or a cycle.	9.929769460101863
This is stable on a.	8.240919216527887
And third is irregular where enthalpy of mixing is not 0 and entropy of mixing also not same as the ideal solution.	10.148904951995378
You lead into a heterogeneous catalysis and the various species that are involved in the reaction , it could be a substrate; it could be inhibitor; it could be simple hydrogen ions which contribute to the ph; they might get partitioned in the two phases depending on the chemical nature of the bulk and the carrier particles and this partition effect can also lead to an apparent loss of enzyme activity in a particular situation.	9.653480202206312
In most of the practical cases where the reactions have been studied the two parameters have been found to be valid and that gives validity to the steady state hypothesis for all practical purposes.	8.659342519912775
So , now , we discussed the various static light scattering techniques and we use of light scattering technique we can wet average molecular weight.	7.9035507499073985
That means florescence decreases and by that one can monitor continuously and the measurement of florescence gives you a direct indication of the concentration of inhibitor in the feed stream.	9.576401342398333
So if you want show this in peterocially , if you are two face system immiscibly system you get corresponding , two t g corresponding to the homo polymers , and if you have completely mixed or miscible blend , miscible copolymers , then you have t g intermediate between these two.	10.47683634524941
If m is higher than 1 molar , then linear polymerization will be preferred that you can see from this expression.	9.458165331063197
Now , you can have a mixture of such networks.	7.945819506760684
Another group of mechanisms that we will discuss are enthalpic factors.	10.374114934385913
Another property of the enzymes in terms of proteins is their solubility.	13.790014346331814
But specificity also has been a factor.	10.568303073983875
Now , let us come back to the kinetics of step growth polymers.	5.104381506888245
So , at the level of 100 degrees of polymer , what do you have in this reaction medium.	8.957943516138998
We have earlier seen the role of external film diffusion as a result of a thin film that is present on the surface of the catalyst particle in the case of a enzyme reactor and we have considered the interactions of the film diffusion along with the biochemical reaction in the case of a non - porous particle and a combined external film diffusion coefficient ki along with the biochemical reaction constant was determined.	9.337568963734357
Plasticizers are nothing but small molecules which basically dissolve in the polymer matrices and like the solvent or some added molecules.	11.70906502057907
Now , if you are doing the other reaction say for example , if i go back to the polycarbonate example in this case , if i instead of taking this bpa.	8.224733021996203
So , we can write like this rt.	5.79541752811947
Similarly when substrate binds to ei complex , dissociation constant is km.	9.786791947894148
Inherent kinetic parameters are those which are obtained as a result of conformational changes only.	11.427968034269584
Let us take an example about polymer degradation.	6.8724557431342905
Earlier we have seen the use of c curve for getting the reactor performance.	11.131843910563815
Removal from the sample is very tedious task and also causes in some cases for example tryptophan , it is destroyed by alkali.	14.115617654806146
Obviously , we discussed back bone stiffness , now i will give few examples , so that we can verify this concept.	10.036225266697306
The substrate concentration profile for such a second order differential equation is usually obtained interms of a thiele modulus.	8.155904885272003
So , if you want make a transparent , or you want to increase correspondent poly metric material , then you should look for a polymer , which has have lower reflective.	10.419680665322122
But , because their availability in terms of copolymerization is different , as a result , their partition ability in the reaction point or the reactor , then the r 1 and y 2 might be different , r 1 and y 2 could be different if the monomer structure changes.	11.757203403286624
Many of the carriers which are available today for adsorption of enzymes are developed for chromatographic separations.	10.148722190803039
On the other hand if you are talking of a lower or reasonable value product or in those cases where even the unconverted substrate can be used along with the product you donot have to separate the product for application as in the case of glucose fructose syrup when you isomerise glucose to fructose the final product is a mixture of glucose and fructose.	8.878211715061981
Now , if we can by any means start almost all the chains at more or less same time; that means , initiation must be faster and then , let the polymers , all these chains we just started let them under go polymerization reaction or propagation reaction for same deviation.	10.528903859187109
When we melt these polymers , if they are stiff , if the polymer is stiff , then the increased entropies is not much.	10.916807304274508
But at the moment we are talking only of biochemical reaction and internal pore diffusion assuming that the transport through a film is fast enough and it does not create any problem.	9.557914769382378
Reacted is p and p is the conversion.	11.080172123537203
Now , what is the , how we can relate to the amount of excess or amount of this mono functional chains topper.	8.375993005147238
Now , again you can write number of average molar mass as well , it is , represent as sometimes like this , some books write like this.	10.656109824698662
Collagen and gelatin are proteins whereas agarose is a polysaccharide.	13.182563131178341
An analogy can be made to a heterogeneous catalysis.	10.218900222829122
So , the molecular weight always decreases , sorry , molecular weight always goes up.	7.504448221390182
Now , from this raw data we must transform this data as a weight fraction molecular weight distribution which is a plot of weight fraction versus molecular weight.	7.653254160658987
If you want to build a molecular weight that means , if you want to build say a degree of polymerization of 100 in a close system , then your equilibrium conversion has to be 0.9 which means your key has to be almost in the order of 10 to the power of .	8.327032998826352
A space velocity is analogous to dilution rate in the cstr and so you will notice here that the same enzyme was able to act on methionine as well as phenylalanine.	12.448966911379678
This is basically an operational definition.	9.350407618118782
From third to the last which is x z how many different way you can add.	13.228903468865646
If you recall in the case of competitive inhibition we have seen that 1 / vi = km / vm ( 1 + i / ki ) . 1 / s + 1 / vm the michaelis menten constant is modified by the amount 1 + i / ki and therefore the value of ki is equivalent to that concentration of the inhibitor at which the slope of the double reciprocal plot is double.	7.904774014371385
Consider this is a vessel.	14.725823258783159
Termination can happen; beta hydride termination to the transition metal.	11.267356253671805
If this is , this is the ion - pairs are totally separated , they are free ion - pairs.	9.721742079179556
When you consider the yield of an immobilization , it is basically a term which can be considered on the basis of material balance.	10.825042525149119
We have seen so far a large variety of immobilization methods.	7.663084311655721
For example glucose is the most commonly used electrode and the immobilization method polyacrylamide gel; oxygen electrode is electrode used and the concentration range it can measure is of the order of ten to the power of minus five to ten to the power of minus four molar.	9.540845051157078
Now , as we have seen just now from the last page , that if you grow the chain , as the reaction progresses , that more and more conversion happens , the chain grows.	8.837493030167405
In case of chemical resistance we basically apply.	10.758265987647544
So , that might cause some questions about the thermal stability of this polymers specially , at the high temperature or during the processing condition , one example is shown here.	8.22745607830034
The folding of these polypeptide chains into alpha helix or the alternative could be the beta pleated sheets , the secondary structure.	9.961268654647434
Before we go in to main mechanism i like to summarize some of the characteristic features of enzyme active sites at least the major one which may be of interest in today s lecture.	9.459794208910854
So , if the repeating units have same stereochemistry , all the monomers , all the repeating units chemistry called isotactic.	10.057253971918353
So , plastic deformation is said to have occurred when the deform material is permanently unable to return to it is initial state and yield point is that where , the materials start showing the plastic deformation.	9.926511575489474
Now , there is a third possibility in this set.	7.235979772748707
We had the original rate equation r p is , d t is , k 3 k cooh ha and oh.	8.888047930146953
Very often it happens that some standard conditions given in the book do not exactly replicate in a laboratory experiment mainly because if the gluteraldehyde solution available is of different age they would have under gone dimerisation.	10.234811467113976
What i am trying to explain is that for each of the enzyme species write down all the path ways involving n - 1 steps.	7.0423845738885555
Gloss is measured , are related to the intensity.	11.203673812374216
If you see the break up you will notice that the there is a significant change in the cost as a result of the raw material.	8.710910383031347
Now , let us look at what we have learnt so far in terms of step - growth polymerization.	6.982769935821092
So , it elongates quite high and entropy change on the deformation is the dominant factor in to the resistance of deformation.	8.895714719058994
There are a large number of reactions which can be catalyzed both by enzymes as well as by chemical catalyst and the subtle mechanisms that are involved in the enzymatic catalysis make them very efficient catalyst meaning a high turn over number or a significant reduction in the energy of activation of reaction.	8.629643038138608
Then obviously , this transparency is , only given by the loss due to the reflection.	11.017902950172827
That is why the enzymes still remain expensive catalyst compared to chemical catalyst.	6.561859932570796
The adsorption method is a very broad , non - specific method and it involves binding of the enzyme to the surface of an insoluble carrier that has not been specifically functionalized for covalent coupling.	10.620211027547898
This is the homo propagation and this is a cross propagation , and this is also a , this is homo propagation and this is pros propagation.	11.521483662550217
So , often polystyrene is used with these stabilizers , uv stabilizer and also as a component or as a blend with other polymers or a co - polymer , with other monomers.	9.361125999984655
If one of the amino acids is transferred or removed the whole folding will change and primarily involved means those which are physically present on the active site.	8.606730920481802
We are going to add the polymers in those in this 3d lattice , one after one; we are going to add the polymer chains in this lattice one after one , one segment after one segment and once we added all the polymer chains then we will add the solvent molecules.	9.449978923974715
How do you control the molecular weight.	8.053003587423651
For bulk industrial processing we have to stop at purity level somewhere in between.	10.447240849683896
We talked about the resonance stabilization of the substituted group , we talked about the electron charge density , electronic charge density , we talked about the steric effect and so on.	7.552973405151261
It is subscript of n , this is the units which gets repeated.	9.93495535044407
Now , in case in emulsion polymerization , you have apparently singular composition , monomer water has a medium , surfactants has a dispersions , but the only difference in this case is that in this case you have water soluble initiator.	9.582984477290067
Mathematically , if we draw this portion again we can , so that is end of . .. . . so , different scientists use different techniques or different techniques to find out the t g.	10.317624473720926
And we talk about and discuss now how to determine the rate constant different rate constant , and we will discuss about their magnitudes and we go next to the auto acceleration gel effect.	10.519776107502656
But once if we say that you have a very high log p value of the solvent which has no miscibility with the water it will not disturb the essential water layer but still a small quantity of water is required in the organic solvents to maintain the catalytic function and there are number of approaches which has been made to provide that small quantity of water and also to strip the water produced in the reaction.	10.801240720538965
Then , the chain in which the ends are capped with b , the other ends are dead.	11.92905732500699
Number of binding sites will be one , four , two , three , five any integer.	9.98882778917806
It is 2.	13.483662188982288
This is the real example where several polymers are plotted and you can see this each polymer has a different caliber has a unique size to weight relationship.	10.174935456786372
And what we will do we will next move to the discussion on living radical polymerization , now we by this time we know that molecular weight in a normal polymerization , radical polymerization comes down.	10.14530682869917
So , once a bond occupies a volume in the space , no other bond can occupy the same space basically presence of a polymer chain of or polymer segment is excluding , any other polymer segments to occupy the same volume.	8.194648152003767
As soon as you go to 0.9 conversion , the relative quantity of enzyme required is 1.95; almost about one and half times.	8.323628537863604
The second step is method of immobilization.	7.244976209723575
In experimental conditions usually no pore diffusional resistance is obtained that means effectiveness factor is approaching one with particles of diameter less than thirty microns and average pore size greater than two thousand angstroms.	10.68682754425394
So , look , how it is from 99, from 98 percent reaction to 99 percent reaction , you are getting jumping degree of , average degree of polymerization from 50 to 10.	10.323218424068454
So , the entropy of mixing contributes less and less to the mixing energy so , if you have very high molecular weight then the entropy of mixing is basically negligible.	7.794157065612769
If you will recollect , see , for a given p , f average is more than 2, then this number will be higher compared to the x n obtained in linear polymer.	9.33987545376904
So , homo polymerization of maleic anhydride is very difficult , it does not happen.	8.378726517078249
In the case of glucose isomerase or the immobilized glucose isomer is the form of.	7.966253311999798
Similarly , we can write , t c is del h 0 p by del s 0 p plus r ln m e.	7.538716165473931
What it is not a as we will discuss that solid state may not be the thermodynamically correct terminology in case of polymer science.	12.483539162669675
Now , in if you talk about same molecular weight obviously if you have a larger ring , this number of monomers you require to make the same length of polymers.	8.838465469098594
So rate of mass transfer is klam.	10.91506127267148
So , if you compare , with material which is existing in that particular application for long time , and if you compare your material , test material , which is as good as that particular material , or even better that particular material in the escalated lab test , then you know that you material will survive that particular temperature , at least as good as the material , which is in the market.	9.72146593894864
So , with this we stop the discussion of determination of molecular weight and we move to the next topic in next lecture.	5.679917698342898
So , there will be always chances of cis and trans forming together.	7.168139090505479
In fact each chain will have its known tertiary structure and then these globular structures will assemble in a format.	10.176150367967175
And if you have a single phase , this gives as a single t g for the co polymer . if you have a block co polymer , now if the block is , the blocks involved here are invisible with each other , then we have multiple phases.	9.142864845649973
In the case of enzyme activity the si unit is katal.	8.096114929181617
For the free enzyme the km values are given here on the left hand side.	7.647283059479842
So , this is the probability; chances of that one of the cells if you choose and pick any of the cell from this lattice , this is the probability that it will be vacant because this is the number of cells which are vacant and this is the total number of cells present in the lattice.	9.727932348764709
So , for that we must know the behavior of a polymer in solid state.	7.111708480987461
And , then , these chain initiating radical react with another monomer , m 1 dot plus m , m 2 dot; this again react with forming m 3 dot.	9.22945431545756
So , they can be placed in any of this first level.	6.9360265548133935
The third factor is stability.	7.791151741064326
At a certain temperature , we are providing some thermal energy.	11.608510754275148
There always has to be a distribution.	12.232436917891109
This is the range.	7.728210526534694
Welcome back this to this course on polymer chemistry , and this lecture we will continue our discussion on chain copolymerization , which we just studied in our last lecture.	5.789398589984735
So , obviously , formation of 6 - membered or 4 - membered or higher membered ring will be always preferred thermodynamically compared to a ring size having 3 - membered or 4 - membered in it.	7.739390802028885
Now , after making the polymer product , what is the fate of the polymer , this is again another very contemporary topic of polymer waste.	10.659673183742058
Is given by k t m dot square , because it is a bi molecular reaction.	8.369364945587318
There are two parameters , two constraints which have to be strictly . . . when we talk of assay of the enzyme.	7.81463104636776
If the anti fogging agents , so , additives were not present , it will condense , and the customers could not be able to look through that film; so , that will basically be a bad property of the film.	10.733642745040745
Either reaction can go in this direction or in this direction there is no constraint on the order of the ternary complex formation.	10.76889486523685
Now they will get terminated and form polymer molecules , dead polymer molecules.	9.19134888102529
That means it remains constant.	7.2215080720751725
But in case if you getting a p d i value is one point less than 2 for a polymers which you have taken out from the solution which means that the low molecular samples which might have left in the solution.	9.209663978932157
So , the first segment of i plus first polymer can we added how many different ways.	8.036083319972636
Now , when you are talking about cyclohexene these are basically we are talking about polyethylene these are polymers whether you start from a three member four member five member these all leads to polyethylene.	8.786265593712146
If this e r is negative , then r p goes up with temperature goes down; if it is positive , then r p goes up with increasing temperature.	8.146607023767917
And concentration of monomer droplets droplets , they are of the order of 10 to the power 12 to 10 to the power of 14 liter inverse , now they are all this monomer droplet are stabilized , again by absorption of the surfactants.	9.594296487112222
Molecular weight of a polymer chain also contribute in the value of t g , but it effect the molecular weight actually dies down after some molecular weight.	11.140016751086737
The linkage that is formed , what we have in the literature and what people have used , is the metal salt linkage.	10.27521371108678
So , typically this will act as an isotropic scatterer and signals which we can normalize with a particular signal which is placed at 90 degree for an aqua solvent.	9.333103841465894
The optimum conditions depend upon the balance of parameters like concentration of the enzyme and cross linking reagent , ph , ionic strength , temperature and reaction time.	11.417406597249231
Then we can have a step input that means initially the tracer concentration is set at zero and then it is raised or suddenly after a time t , after some time it is in the feed stream continuously you supply a tracer let us say concentration one , hundred percent and then this input again in the reaction vessel will come out in the case of a exponential behavior.	10.793096628058645
That means certain functional group on the substrate will bind to certain active sites and the active sites will have certain catalytic sites which will interact with the functional residues on the substrate molecule which has to undergo change , the bonds that has to be broken.	9.64371512384206
Now , what happened if we take water and cool it down.	7.697945467762847
We talked about additives , which will be added during compounding or processing , and we get either the intermediate products , which are sold in market or we can get the simple shaped final product like sheets , film etc.	11.808850882400781
Now , for all practical purposes , as i said that , this are equilibrium reaction; this condensed are taken out from the reaction by applying high vacuum and high temperature.	7.361069695699806
Now , let us start with our discussion on constitutional isomers which sometimes also called structural isomers.	6.901830331867028
Now , what will be the poly number of , average number of molecular weight in the second case , this one.	8.574703217998072
And , for a practical syntheses of step growth polymers , you need to take out this condensed from the reaction by applying high temperature and high vacuum , so that the reaction proceed to the product side.	9.826945962476278
Stage ii , at the end of stage ii all the monomer droplets disappeared , because the monomer has been supplied to the reacting polymer particle , surrounded by the surfactant molecules , and stage iii is basically the completion of the polymerization reaction inside those reacting , or active polymer particles.	10.419289224599012
We can take up those issues one by one and to begin with we can only consider an idealized enzyme reactor system.	8.42563178170216
Then nonbonding electrons , molecular orbital sometimes if the nonbonding molecular weight are the highest orbitals , occupied then the electronic transition may happen from nonbonding molecular orbital to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.	10.252471010759226
So , sometimes this this polymerization is called powder or granular polymerization.	8.718019169063941
The kappm has been a parameter which people have tried to define; quantitatively what are the parameters which can define the km apparent and one of the most acceptable definitions of kappm can be kappm = km / pf where p is the partitioning coefficient that is concentration of the substrate in solid phase divided by concentration of the substrate in the bulk phase that is the bulk liquid.	10.569269840495084
And we also get information about say shapes of the polymer branching etcetera also can be obtained from these detectors.	11.089720371053852
So , not only we can find out the molecular weight , we can find out the conversion from monomer to polymer , and also if we add the second monomer to form a block , then we can get the information about the composition of the block , as well as the length of the all the molecular weight of individual block.	8.892701044610307
Because , in normal temperature , this reverse reaction is very insignificant for 10 polymers , but typically it do not represent , say , reaction like polyethylene formation with a reversible sign.	11.3751114407922
This is a lower number.	7.0171894798997485
Sometimes you want to identify the amino acid residue at the active site.	9.592069519302155
So , if you have any solution having pie 2 value in this region , immediately they will phase separate and form two equilibrium solution , one is polymer rich , one is solvent rich.	9.041270582764346
Initially they will be at a ground state of their electronic , vibrational and rotational ground states but they will posses the translational energy which can make them move and collide.	10.921298300157122
You can shear then and you can shear in rotational way as well , you can bend them , bend a polymer by applying stress in in the middle of the polymer where , the two sides are supported.	12.332070661677854
Now , how do you know.	6.401063243656907
Similarly for ea you will get only one pattern which will be feasible that is you are going in the anti - clockwise fashion that is your k3b , k4 and k1.a and the relative concentration will be e0 ( k1k3k4 b . a ).	11.369595952637056
We can use m m r techniques to find out the fraction of m , r or m r in the all this we can find out quantitably from m m r experiment.	10.461925313075392
Once the magnitude of kl is known then one can really incorporate the value of kl into the rate constant of a reactor performance equation.	11.054618679753373
Those are the added components.	13.625233714267388
For most of the industrial applications except for some of the medical or diagnostic applications you will not require a highly purified enzyme.	9.892608897338237
Similarly here if you plot 1 / b versus the magnitude of slope you will get again a straight line with the slope equal to k a . kb / vm and intercept of ka / vm.	8.745027565209938
Two of them are complementary and can easily bind without any problem.	9.737840970521995
All these parameters particularly the inhibitors , rather their inhibition pattern , their deactivation pattern , the mass transfer requirements , the mass transfer limitations and the non - ideal flow behavior; these are the four things.	10.139667094083936
If you have intermediate molecule like this , it can take part in a intra molecular cyclization reaction or it can also as usual , what you just learnt all the time , it can take out linear reactions to make high molecular polymer.	10.156510437911564
Continue this here.	14.692987522087734
But in this case , the nature of the copolymer would depend upon the reactivity of the functional group if this functional group is same having same reactivity with the other functional group then it will form a random copolymer.	6.714874756337336
It is weight fraction.	7.552222890539455
So , i can write 12.5 12.5 give it 12..	8.158098391479461
So , we see here that from reaching up to 98 percent conversion , it takes about 450 minutes and build a average degree of polymerization of 5.	9.286279971000686
In this case if you poly a , and a block poly b , then you can actually used these copolymer , block copolymer as a comfortabalizer , between poly a and poly b , and by doing this you can actually improve the property of the blend , of poly a and poly b.	8.433963945063931
This the one example , where you can see that copolymerization techniques are used to improve the properties of polystyrene , by copolymerization with other copolymer , if you have three co monomers basically we use the term third polymer , for the co polymers which are produced in this a a from this three monomers.	11.59708949976669
But still it is one of the earliest methods that we had known and had been used.	8.856572245627254
If there is a pi bond in the compound or a molecule and specially , if the pi bond there are many pi bonds which are pi orbitals or pi bonds which are conjugated , then the pi pi transitions , transitions are of like uv - visible range , and the mole conjugation , mole it goes to visible range , and higher wavelength.	11.074160968441735
These are the three major classes of continuous reactors but in practice a number of hybrids of these reactor systems have been proposed by people both in the case of cstr as well in the case of plug flow reactors.	8.42481363198239
For visible light radiation , it depends on the polarizibilty of the medium polarization of the molecules or the particles which is scattering light or the one which the light is bombarded.	11.179639187685657
So , what we do.	5.538590962527883
Because there also you couple a ligand on to a matrix by covalent binding to get a stable ligand bound matrix and almost similar chemistry because we have similar functional groups available here.	10.887656432192422
The product purity also has a role to play in decision making of the use of immobilized enzyme otherwise product purity can be very high in the case of a immobilized enzyme used in continuous reactors because there is no contamination from the enzyme protein.	9.067118086260711
How are you exercising control of ph.	12.493041736181242
Whereas , p is given the probability of the propagation radical will continue to propagate and build polymer which is r p divided r p plus r t and are transfer , where if the polymer is terminated by combination reaction than this gives by this.	9.294615889314137
There are definitive , there are some definitive advantages for example , i just gave you example of the spec.	11.942454875567453
There are two things you must appreciate in contrast to the film diffusional effects.	7.676638114135057
So , in this case , if the chain transfer happen with another polymer molecule the two thing happening is , one you are getting branches and another important thing particularly for this case is that , x n bar does not change here , no change.	9.205910715821705
And m remember m w by m n is pdi poly dispersive index.	9.857765167856526
For example , if we talking about laser having 633 nanometer wavelength then it is about say 15 or 30 nanometer; we are talking about lambda dash by 20; or if you take a laser wavelength little lower at the beginning of the visible light then it will be around twenty nanometer.	9.448642106408077
The whole reaction will be over in a couple of minutes.	9.860993112295947
Similarly yeast hexokinase also follows this kind of mechanism where the ternary complex formation is obtained.	10.311117438846791
Now , what we are going to discuss is how the chain dimension , the chain size namely the rms end - to - end distance; and radius of gyration varies when we introduce the restriction on bond rotation.	7.4222471337012905
Now , to be why there why do we require to bring or mix to polymers , sometimes what happen one polymer is not sufficient enough to meet all the strange and requirement of properties for a product.	9.041141356903418
When i say catalyst that means not all proteins will qualify to be called enzymes.	8.783459857285555
You need a matrix to which the enzyme can be immobilized in general.	8.335378640885763
And this solubility parameter can be also obtained by group contribution method , and this how it is done there particularly the solubility this is done theoritically delta is this , f is the contribution form or the value for different groups.	10.93327951573913
So , this anionic polymerization mainly happen without termination , as long as termination , as long you has have inert atmosphere and extremely clean glassware analyzing skills.	9.3115856647803
I will quickly go through the mathematical part , not plus this is minus.	10.35698141227132
This discussion may not end; this lecture we will continue in the following lecture.	9.246045140608736
So this is hard material , regular structure , crystallize easily.	9.254138250047822
This shows the performance of a plug flow reactor as a response to a pulse input.	10.67244118448098
But this is , you should have , you know , you should have knowledge , that during the chain , during the polymerization the chains can undergo exchange reaction between them and they can be subtle , like if you have two different , if you are starting with , say for example , if you are not starting with two monomers a and type , your type , you are starting with different oligomers and carrying out the reaction from there.	10.035222234161974
The polymers which are made from carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and hydrogen and as inorganic polymers , where beside this elements , carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , you have silicon , phosphorus , boron , sulphur , such elements in the polymer molecules for example siloxanes , silanes , silicon , phosphazenes.	10.594436626103587
Now , this is not sufficiently neucleofilic to reinitiate a chain polymerization , which also means , that if you have h 2 o present , undesired h 2 o present giving the polymerization medium , in a , in the polymerization medium , then it has very detrimental effect in terms of molecular rate build up because if there are trace amount of history also , this will immediately react with the propagating carbon ion anionic end and stop the reaction immediately , which will have very detrimental effect in terms of building molecular weight.	9.907703267219869
So , this propagating chain are always of this ionic group , are always accompanied by a counter ion of oppositely charged , that is always happens.	9.661620571316176
So enzyme loading is another factor and we want a preparation with as high loading as possible theoretically.	11.247518003579211
Tau in the case of the batch reactor is the batch reaction time.	9.815902918373284
If we consider a single data point that means at any given point of s1, we consider v.	11.051926118961147
Slight shift in these individual units can totally change the functional behavior of the enzyme.	10.355745754916347
And second , it is independent of size of the molecule , or how for the two functional group are present; whether they are present in the dimer , or in a octamer.	12.54148610618171
So , they basically give a perfect ideal copolymerization.	7.455396533858324
How many molecules reacted.	10.336406957388814
That is a system like this will not be permissible if it happens.	9.222488846976825
We have been always assuming that briggs and haldane gave it.	9.300455675865827
The three water soluble materials are mixed to which an initiator is added.	9.293249307395635
Whether it is after 10, 11, 12, 20, 50, 100 you know after how many repeat units , you call a polymer as a polymer and before that you call as a oligomer.	11.058034871244885
So , huggins found out that k versus eta square is linear and pass through origin; k is the slope.	9.95840119523161
So , what which is we know that , the word the potential energy , the chances of that being stable is higher; so this is 1, 2, 3, 4, these are four carbon atom in a butane , we are not writing the hydrogen groups here.	9.23690123905385
Three general types of isotherms are known.	11.654926027966296
In uk ,.	13.352253085356827
So , how to get isotactic polymers; we will discuss that in the next lecture.	5.579670273538649
So , the viscosity is lower and lower , so that you can take out the phenol molecule.	7.21143451787295
Similarly you can also plot the apparent km.	9.01398747611955
Obviously , the sizes of the polymer molecules and the solvent molecules are different.	6.984803727447228
These beads are pores with a pore size varies between say 50 armstrong in to 10 to the power 5 armstrong.	10.074539421543559
It is clearly pointed out by eyring in his transition state theory that every chemical reaction proceeds via formation of the unstable intermediate between reactants and the products.	9.250209521630195
We know that lewis acidity follow this order.	9.3775784926614
For each of these two data points a straight line relationship between km and vm must be valid at least from the mathematical point of view.	10.978994190228537
So , as we know that the reactivity , for the finally , the outcome of the reaction , it depends upon the collision frequencies.	8.964618573173064
Second is d is large.	10.839007995424078
Unlike the earlier case say butylene glycol and ethylene glycol even if there are were any differences in the activity between two hydroxide groups.	11.14513812498076
Then the microstructures of copolymers , the composition , the series , the sequence of the monomers by which the copolymer is made , so the all these are important.	10.730881509065284
So , there will be always a molecular distribution associated with when we make a polymer.	6.853885458635082
So , for a given time , you are getting illed , number of polymers you are getting more but the rate at which polymers monomers is reacting is similar as the original rate , for the molecular weight drop significantly.	9.934304564778692
So , this is 86 not 172 for this example.	6.957081263292037
I try to write this one using the same you will arrive at for the same expression as michaelis menten equation.	10.601885559683103
The higher concentration of the substrate at the active site means that the enzyme provides a new micro environment in which the substrate concentrations are much higher than in the bulk and you get the net effect of higher substrate concentration on the reaction rate.	9.222919266015184
Then we have multiple t gs , each t g represents the t g for the corresponding homopolymer.	8.402926692707092
And in normal temperature , typically the reaction temperature , it is the temperature , where we do reactions , this dominates so the reaction these chain polymerization are; thermo dynamically feasible , in most cases are not.	10.048953084113363
But always it may not apply because the concentration of the second substrate will never be in excess in the living cell.	9.62365221803794
If you just consider the definition of.	8.075734897559439
So , we can write this as c by m n a v h.	6.277150783135252
If you recollect from the discussion we had , in the first two lectures that , in case of chain polymerization , the molecular rates builds very soon , and then it says , at very low conversion itself , it builds very high molecular weight , and the molecular weight remains has high , you know and very high during the conversion.	10.25014665528949
So , delta r for isotropic scatterer is angle independent.	8.558746457455456
For example in the first case in the diagram , in part a you notice that , the effect of ph is shown against the percentage rate of the maximum value.	9.052901949875794
While testing the several test parameter must be consider , for comparing the chemical resistance , or resistance of different polymer for example , time , of the contact with chemical temperature , at which you are doing the experiment , the stress level.	11.243304215978682
So , the reaction is too fast or it should not be too slow.	7.0169781700509875
Suppose this is the carrier particle.	14.336369594397347
Molecular weight , molecular weight will further come down.	11.037342538451785
Similarly , here you have a reference heater , and you have reference thermo - couple , which determines the temperature.	9.657147857485183
That is the basis of their energetic efficiency.	9.165140825533673
Substrate as well as the inhibitor binds reversibly , randomly and independently at different sites.	10.188415466164312
Now , in case of step growth polymerization , we also talked about that you know you typically have a monomer react with monomer at the beginning gives you a dimer.	8.97939048998535
So , stress is plotted against time or stress now remember , in this test and all subsequent polymer property testing , you must because , this test is very much dependent on the size , shape of the specimen and the environment , what you when you are doing the test like temperature and relative humidity of the environment.	10.277022326427929
A reasonable magnitude of this will be let us say about thousand per second and even at this thousand per second the exponential of course at time equal to let us say five minutes or three hundred seconds the magnitude of this exponential will be less than . 0.	11.840385478876028
Now what is the source for initiator , we require a radical species to initiate the polymer chain , and we now we will look at what are the molecules which , or what are the possible ways we can generate radical , in the reaction medium.	9.992534496747595
So , basically the degrees of freedom for internal rotation or the mobility of the chain effect the value of t g.	7.14468998337462
Therefore its use in a number of industrial reactors is probably very difficult because it will not be able to withstand the shear and the mechanical load which an industrial reactor for chemical processing will require.	10.845767810840988
These types of polymers actually show optical activity.	9.375857184500756
Say we actually immerse the test sample in that particular chemical agent , for that particular temperature , and for a particular specified time.	11.036266921016248
One of the most disadvantageous situations in the case of static process is that the loading of the enzyme is not uniform over the carrier.	9.183418420927934
Then you may need to monitor certain parameters , the instrumentation control , down stream processing of the product , all has to be integrated so as to have a complete application route.	11.497191780008698
So , if the sample is half , then the amount of , or intensity of the light , which is specularly reflected will be lower , and there will be reduction in the value of gloss.	10.997890650578151
This is another example another set of polymers is polyamide imides you take this aromatic diamines with one side poly anhydride and the carbo oxalic acid silica acids to form this amide polyamide imides.	10.225704507575353
Secondary anti oxidants , they are hydro peroxide decomposers; react with hydro peroxides and produce non radical products.	12.950503729894951
So , you can find this easily , the other one.	6.853314072780564
And we also studied in that context that in case of branching reaction going on the molecular build up is higher for a given conversion in comparison to a linear polymerization.	9.643386900944545
Then , we talked about importance of copolymerization in last lecture , how we can improve the property of an existing homo polymer by introducing another co - monomer in the polymer.	9.208598188852354
The factor operational stability will be identical in the case of two types cstr and pfr if we are operating on a system in the zero order regime whereas if you are operating in the case of first order regime , the first term will get out will be neglected and then the difference in conversion . . . .. . . . .. . between pfr and cstr will be magnified.	10.781163872743821
As you have seen that most , as i said that most of the case , pdi of polymer after the reaction found to be little lower to in practice.	9.1348038458499
There are two r s r and r are the alkyl residues.	8.7809658286819
Now , as you now that , most cases the reaction is carried out with the isometric amount of cooh and oh.	8.785038851543993
So , fire retardants have chemicals , which are used to retard the ignition and burning of plastics , by interfering with the chemistry and or the physics of the combustion process.	9.157003664245144
So , w i is the weight fraction of the molecules having molecular rate of m i.	6.972208810750013
I have shown here some of the reagents like ent which is water soluble derivative of poly ethylene glycol , entp is a water insoluble derivative of polypropylene glycol and entb is a water insoluble derivative of polybutadiene.	9.78206560542322
In this case it is k - 2 and k - 1of this one and the third path way will be pk2 k - .	8.849996031637454
Eh + s ehs eh + p if you assume that eh is the catalytically active form that is the enzyme is present in the form of eh , in that case the vm , the maximum reaction velocity will be vm = k . e0.h + / h + + k the enzyme is present in the form of eh and therefore you multiply k , the rate constant k here , with the concentration of eh.	9.678169272078847
So , this is the number of a groups remaining and this is the number of bb group , b group remaining.	7.310029737448723
If there is slight modification either in the conformation of the key it will not fit to the lock and thereby the reaction will not occur.	10.470523041161627
It is the temperature at which a flatten , needle of one mille meter square cross section , under specific constant load is applied , and the temperature at which penetrates , the plastic specimen to a depth of one mille meter , it is known as high cut softening temperature.	9.940897530924907
How this radical , m n dot , they can get terminated.	9.668576934987904
So , as we have seen , i understood in last lectures , previous lectures that to make a high enough molecular weight which is useful for application p as to be very close to .	7.193527270515678
So in most cases , this reaction , this reaction dominates than these reactions , so it s this is one of the cases of transfer.	10.186303991983374
If this is negative , if it is positive , then the rate of reaction increases with the temperature.	8.037660333986748
When you store the glutaraldehyde solution , it is present in two different forms.	10.969137063078227
Unless you get two different samples in the same linear range you cannot depend on the result because if you take a higher concentration of the enzyme you may be able to measure this reaction rate which is much lower than you would have got in a diluted sample.	11.577817309664507
And in fact , if you increase density of the polymer matrix , the barrier properties goes up.	9.83879139372572
If suppose we design an experiment to make a covalent binding with n terminal amino groups of the enzyme protein , but if the reagents will act on n terminal amino groups , it will be very difficult to ensure that none of the amino groups of the lysine are involved.	10.52356723935242
There are different types of impact test available , which you know the you have to if you are applying a designing any you have made a polymer and you want to test , you have molded it and you want to test impact properties then , you need to know the target application.	12.12678510539897
And you can do the polymerization in emulsion as well.	6.935108805219959
Now just the same information which we discussed we can compare between a branched chain and a linear chain.	9.948117455393907
Activation energy for the immobilized aminoacylases immobilized by different methods also undergoes a change.	11.161535674201318
And reverse history , if we know the values of del s and del h , we can find out the relation between the m e and t c.	10.368860753963856
Because if you study the use of one of the products of these bi - substrate reaction as an inhibitor and see their interaction with the effect on the rate expression you will notice that the different products x or y when used as an inhibitor they give rise to different pattern of inhibition , which we noted earlier.	10.741684246199293
I don t think any other filtration device is available which is so specific and lasting.	10.321474972737679
So , in all the cases , it will produce the same radical.	9.733628958289692
This conclusion will apply commonly to a chemically catalyzed reaction or an enzymatic catalytic reaction.	9.655783748230437
Another fact is if one were interested to determine the value of ki in comparison to km and vm and the characteristic pattern of inhibition , you can use the double reciprocal plot as a basis for determining the value of ki.	10.813632651325982
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
So , how many number; this is number of cells already occupied by the polymer segments.	7.813598311984213
Therefore eab will be given by e0 ( k1 k2 k4 a b ) eab =.	9.346052250976843
Now just recap , we had whatever discussion we had in last lecture , about the chain dimension , polymer chain dimension for a linear polymer chain we discussed that most of the polymer chains are flexible in nature; and they form random coil structure , either in solution or in merit.	10.532363461463644
Now let us look at the requirements of an immobilized system.	7.874507397572525
Here also you can actually get numerous numbers of composition , by choosing different a and b , and mixing them in different define ratio , but you know most cases , you cannot make two polymers , to homo polymers.	9.940020465621533
So , they are very close and at that the end of the reaction , again they will remain in this form.	7.066309200741952
Now , for a bulk polymerization this rates comes down rustically at the end will come and discuss why in a minute from now.	10.031855959537623
Presence of crystallites helps in reducing the permeability of different gases.	13.516040241098315
There are many preparations like for example preparation of fumaric acid from aspartic acid where the enzymes are too specific and usually there are no other enzymes present in the cell which will be able to utilize those substrate.	10.228635193534549
For example the propylene , we just mentioned in the last slide.	11.410536279753881
So , you have a much more broader polymer distribution.	7.509649010243747
So , structural units is same as repeat units and in this case whether you have a say example of poly terephthalic acid pet terephthalate pet to it is the polymer is derived from two different units then the repeat units is this whereas , this consists of two structural units.	11.402256766752831
That means the free energy change for binding process may be the same.	6.638701458777937
It will be water soluble with lot of hydrophilic groups and the enzyme can easily mix with the solution.	9.489529346528842
The 1 - f1 fraction is getting channeled or bypassed from the mixing pattern and therefore one is losing.	11.622963761964911
So , each third segment can be placed again by z p way; four segments can be placed in z multiplied by p s and so on.	7.657327496592168
I am putting v / vm - v as one and at that value the corresponding value of log s will be log s0..	10.254935187355082
Getting little confused.	18.504227845233707
We see , we visually inspect the material , whether any swelling has happened or in surface eroded or some cracking and crazing is happened.	10.120090818574559
So , c i can be written as n i is the number of molecule; m i is the molecular weight of that molecule.	8.22094770698776
Then you have glass transition temperature , then you have melting point or melting temperature , and then the degradation temperature or decomposition temperature.	9.795658721505571
But any way it has to transfer from the bulk phase to the stationary phase and their might be some concentration gradient in the substrate.	10.660326016361124
In the case of soluble enzyme the use of plug flow reactor will drive away the enzyme simultaneously and you cannot use it continuously.	8.441037836422442
Whether this addition polymers or a condensation polymers because they are not synthesized in the lab , so we do not know the constituent from or the monomers from which are the type of reaction is condensation reaction on a addition reaction by which they are synthesized , but looking at the structure , what we can anticipate or we can imagine or we can hypothesize , monomers form which they have been synthesized , they can be synthesized in the lab or in other words , the polymers can be degraded to some other small monomers , monomeric molecules , hypothetical monomeric molecules from which this can be synthesized.	10.379958364081972
So , basically if you have a reaction radical reaction , radical copolymerization between styrene and vinyl acetate , these are the 2 products of the reaction propagating dominantly.	9.48468353967964
How we can we have learned how to synthesize the polymers.	8.142547531663638
Only those proteins which have catalytic function , that means they can accelerate the rate of a particular reaction , can be termed as enzymes.	10.618555134547073
So , which we have random distribution of , or sequence of the copolymer , and also m 2; this is a , m 2 is , or f 2 in this case , f 2 is higher than f 1, if r 2 is higher than r .	11.395061197872533
Next , normally the propagation happen; propagation step , where it reacts with oxygen forming peroxide radical; and , this radical start the further chain reaction , forming further radical.	10.90413579645329
Obviously , a can only react with b.	9.158685785881724
So therefore all the intermolecular forces that attribute to the enzyme conformation are altered.	10.693900427196773
This carbon will not have a planar geometry.	9.156061045464625
Similarly , if we have a this ratio of these three carbonates , then we will know that this is a random arrangement.	9.05408968903263
And the inherent termination reactions , as in the case of cationic polymerization by beta proton elimination , in that cationic polymerization case are not present here because beta hydride elimination is difficult.	9.54984690762707
Actually it gives you worst property , then the individual homopolymers , unless you have a mechanism to , comfortablize , or misapplies , or have some sort of interaction between the two homopolymers.	12.509540914595393
So , we just said that the barrier , or the permeability properties of polymers depends upon the , diffusivity of the gas concerned , and of course , the solvability of that gas in the particular polymer.	9.200576574372699
The enzyme follows a kinetic behavior which can only be understood at the initial reaction rate that means when you carry out the reaction the rate of product formation at time zero.	9.246540210916887
Now , for p , 0.99 or 99 percent x n corresponding to 100 and t is almost 8.	10.567641581765288
And then these are now heated to a much higher temperature and the ethylene glycol is distilled out from the reaction.	9.557431922896992
In fact two of the systems which were very early reported were glucose by glucose oxidase and lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase.	10.086708419867334
So , again what happened.	5.562367880844345
Because of , rings of aromatic rings they can do interaction between them and because of this specific interaction , they form their entropy of mixing is negative and as a result , they form as result they form miscible blend.	9.22316375677362
So , if you stop the reaction in the beginning , you will see a lot of these high conformation conversion , but a lot of these small oligomers.	7.1180081124083685
Thermo , thermal process because e d is highest it was getting effected by the temperature rise.	12.170072803220153
But , these are not; this is the normanic life steps; there are though , they protect from uv light , but they have some other problems which basically prevent their use in practical applications.	11.232130916947105
Now , what do you call this as addition polymer or a condensation polymer.	7.788540436045036
So , we require n 1 plus n 2 x which is n 0; this is the number of lattice we require where each size of each lattice is either same as the size of solvent molecules or same as the size for a segment of a polymer.	8.856228700237367
From this again by dividing this term you can get the value of k a.	8.203179216247673
So , limiting oxygen index is basically , the volume of oxygen required , by the total volume into hundred that gives a percentage of material.	10.087883461538267
Then the length of the kinetic chain or if they are doing a termination by this propagation , then they are the x n is same as the kinetic chain length.	10.327531984192632
In the second case of recycle reactor , if the product outlet is closed and the total enzyme is then recycled back into the feed , the whole operation can be carried out over a period of time which is a batch reaction time.	8.980733805296163
So , the total unit of this polymer would be given by x n bar multiplied by 86 plus 1.	9.10608782788425
So , the termination reaction his low now once the termination reaction his low steady state is lost.	7.025066910489641
Now continuing with the importance of copolymer for example , if a polystyrene homopolymers , polystyrene homo polymerization is a brittle polymerization , brakes down easily , and also it has poor solvent or chemical resistance.	10.851892827998373
Now , most cases , most of the polymers , this entropic term is negative; most of the , in case most of the polymers , as we have seen earlier this entropic term is positive.	10.228459777932727
So that gives you a neat analytical procedure to define your kinetic behavior of the allosteric enzymes that are available in the living systems mostly for regulatory purposes.	9.440688488410105
But as all of us know , that the polymer sample consist of many chains of different length , so the t g corresponding to each chains are different , so that is why we get a board nature of this transition , because each higher size polymers will have slightly have t g correspondence to compare to a polymer chain having , lower size.	10.637877042433763
This del g is less than zero , for the typical temperature , where we do reactions in the lab , which means that , most of these double bond containing monomers should polymerize given is thermo dynamic feasibility , but if you think there is the kinetic , about the kinetic factor , not every monomer not every monomer containing double bond , can be polymerized with , every type of initiator , that depends upon the structure.	10.3421527489631
But when you are starting with the monomers , it does not matter , you will finally going to get the same polymers , whether there is or there is not any reshuffling exchange reaction between the two growing chain.	10.30923766162623
But initial autolysis of the cell increases gives some.	11.206890100190636
Similarly , if you take two homopolymers , and blend them , if we have invisible , again similar thing , then you have invisible multiple phases , multiple t gs.	10.62894310580339
In some cases , they are slightly above 1 and possible and in the usual copolymer reaction.	10.38905440277666
If you look into some values of.	7.099520349507203
Similarly , the example here; these two are stiff components.	8.990793353483628
So , every temperature , there is associated , for every temperature there is a ceiling temperature , there is associated equilibrium monomer concentration.	9.123993874496888
See whether we can estimate , we can predict what would be the molecular with distribution , both numbers average and weight average , weight fraction and distribution of the molecules present.	10.179190854124686
Here you have little better situations in the sense that the data are usually not so clustered.	10.23803687401199
In basically it is the combination of again the similar type of compounds and there has been a lot of research happened in this field.	10.920771546080752
So all these things contribute to the weathering of the polymers , to different extent; for example , the uv radiation is the most important parameter for , responsible for weathering of polymer , so they decreasing importance is , this way.	10.954722037229509
We are putting c0 as step input of tracer.	10.076841346597403
Therefore at high salt concentration adsorption is usually poor and minimum salt concentration is required to be kept.	9.97910185730963
So , please do remember all this terminologies , this yield point , this is final break point so , elongation at the break , ultimate strain and this slope , the initial slope gives us the elastic modulus.	10.856163930220516
Basically , steric effect or let me write steric effect of side groups.	9.7108029142307
If i react with another kinetic chain , and form a dead polymer by coupling reaction , then you have a polymer chain , which have two residues.	9.534861072932106
And so , as this , the hydro oxide group; remember , we talked about the equal reactivity of functional groups; so , we are considering all this functional group present at the end of a molecules are equal.	9.02641566597971
So , if you compare under this curve which is nothing but the intensity of those signal it comes out approximately 65 percent , and this is 32 percent , and this is 3 percent , which shows that this synthesize pmma is predominantly a syndiotactic pmma , if you have this m n groups maximum , then you would have isotactic pmma maximum now , let us this is a spectrum for a copolymer of mma and styrene , so this is a copolymer of copolymer of styrene and mma , methyl methacrylate.	9.583818252137414
The method is very simple.	5.716755499584101
And in most cases vapor pressure of the polymer solutions are invariably much lower than what has been predicted from the raoult s law which is the law describing the ideal solution.	10.140432643208324
For example in the case of second profile , this one , there is an initial increase of the enzyme activity and then the normal decay.	10.624755664011463
In the case of a and b acting in the absence of any catalyst , in our case we are considering enzyme as catalyst , when the transition state compound is formed there is a loss of entropy.	8.490962568322177
So , if you design a mechanism by which you can start all the polymers together , so if you design , can design a mechanism or you can start all the polymer together , and let all this polymer all this polymers undergo polymerization or propagation for same duration.	9.22023083042048
As far as the regulation of enzyme synthesis is concerned most of the enzymes are regulated entities.	9.243937326098688
So , with increase in elastic modulus of a plastic material , flexible modulus or bending modulus also go up.	7.5490307332616196
Because of the solvent molecules or small molecules or the free molecules , the solvent goes up.	9.863456265240693
On the other hand look at an example here on physical absorption on bentonite.	7.712504769027018
What is the ph.	9.81830860988499
And when a reaction has progressed some for some duration and then duration there is a chance that monomers might form dimer or small molecular weight , oligomers.	12.087192042558856
Now , this two regions are the exclusion limit and they are the cut off for the two regions where the size goes up beyond this molecular weight then none of the polymer chains can go in.	9.900915623119314
In the sample having mass of w i.	9.292338030366754
So , this is the average number of , we can get it from this and you know , unless the monomer is the monomer is sterically crowed.	8.556742350397228
Some of the typical reagents , although it s not the complete list but some of the typical reagents which are commonly used are diazobenzidine , it has two functional groups and 1,5 difluro 2,4 dinitrobenzene - two nitrate groups and fluro groups and trichloro - s - triazine and hexamethylene diisocyanate.	10.336552545083405
One segment will have z polymer contacts; next one will have z minus 1 contacts; next one also z minus 1 contact.	9.638325510955752
You notice in this expression that higher the required conversion level , higher the relative amount of the enzyme required in the cstr.	10.320862417024298
So , this is just theoretical number.	6.674968552026744
But the same scenario doesn t happen.	8.961697325517909
Now , as we can imagine or understand by now , that ring formation is a mono , unimolecular process , whether linear polymerization is a bimolecular process.	9.351518234262901
This is a , let us consider a simple polyethylene molecule.	7.980437859677315
Now , if we do not want to specify the microstructure , whether it is a statistical copolymer , as alternate copolymer , block copolymer , then we can simply write poly styrene , and write co in between acylonitrile.	8.86572743134967
Now , this is called nowadays initiator because this is the species , which is supplying the h plus or r plus.	9.878016245927608
So , research was still under way to understand the mechanism of the emulsion polymerization process.	7.932548979892655
And especially , if added for polar monomers , for example if i take an acrylate , and let us consider a propagating chain and it can actually abstract hydrogen.	11.055815851401478
Most commonly you may end up getting a profile of a very sharp maximum and we are familiar with the typical terminology called bell shaped curve.	10.4224283957752
You have a large molecular weight.	6.602997970029213
If we do the reaction , if we take the methyl methacrylate and do the reaction with a anionic initiator , say for example , butyl lithium in say toluene at a lower temperature.	10.080380035490261
So these are some of the illustrated examples not that these are the only processes which are operational; a large number of other processes which are operational commercially all over the world are one is penicillin acylase.	8.753552196455525
We discussed the various types of chain transfer reactions possible in radical polymerization , and their effect; effect on molecular weight in principle , that modes are chain , more chain transfer happen , molecular weight actually gets reduced compared to if there was no chain transfer reaction.	9.602780921711807
This is the inflection point this is the inflection point.	9.48221749304738
So , it is always advisable , it is always preferred and always industrial , it is always done to have monomer , which are extremely pure , very pure , so that you know what you are putting if you are adding two monomers.	10.101151938488194
The first and probably the foremost is yield of immobilization.	6.197922083847542
For example , if you have a diacyl chloride plus diol , which forms polyester plus hcl.	7.535715775172043
N i is the number of molecules , number of molecules in that sample.	7.971206041154108
Temperature is a constant.	10.974189269858874
It mean that the first order transitions which , in case of first order transitions like melting where g is a linear function of basically it varies with temperature , pressure and volume continuously.	11.08745811787776
Then also we will notice the effectiveness factor to be greater than one.	10.795955200420394
Some reactions occur better in organic solvent which have low dielectric constant compared to water and this may be due to the fact that some of the attractive repulsive forces between the electric charges are much weaker in the medium of high dielectric constant that is water than in those with lower dielectric constant.	10.899013700323843
If the middle thing is the ionisable form , then you can also predict that the left hand side form of the enzyme eh2 is more reduced form than the eh and then eh is more reduced than e.	10.61207780247737
Now , this will come from the individual values of e p , e d and e t.	7.866042857198197
And that happens there , is if there is the very good interruption between the polymer matrices and the surface of these clay.	11.729648510373062
If you have a resonating group here , which is electron droning neutron pushing , so it cannot stabilize a anionic group here , even if there is a weak electron withdrawing , group of by electron effect of this , word group by in the inducting effect.	10.83905919410356
In the case of pfr the same reaction expression will result in xs0 - km ln ( 1 - x ) + s20 / 2ks ( 2x - x2 ) = k2e0 e.	6.949901026240324
Now , you remember , when we talk about step polymers , give example how you make a step copolymerization , if you have , say , two different acids , di - acids , you can react with diol and make a polyester and in that case it is a copolyester because it has got r dash and it actually consists of two monomers , two different di - acids.	11.487751380221308
The fourth method is electrodeposition process in which the carrier is placed in proximity to one of the electrodes and the current is applied between the two electrodes and the enzyme particles which are charged usually they get deposited on the carrier particles and at the end the carrier is removed which gets coated by the enzyme particle.	11.52824642276991
If you choose monomers from same sets , then they will tend to form a ideal polymer.	7.636211160120644
In the case of cholesterol , cholesterol oxidase , collagen membrane and oxygen electrode is the measurement device.	8.506946250175952
The other methods that are known and available for immobilization of an enzyme are cross linking , covalent binding , entrapment within a matrix - it could be a gel , fibre or a microcapsule and finally the containment of soluble enzymes in the ultra filtration reactors and they are the whole variety of immobilization methods out of which we will be talking in a short while about the cross linking methods.	10.347204383112263
So , you can actually combine these three strategies , like using polar molecular , polymer solvent like thf , thf and do reaction in much lower temperature , say like at minus 78 degree centigrade and use bulky initiator.	8.954326060946316
If you notice here some of the experimental conditions , amino acylase was immobilized by ionic binding to deae sephadex 0.2m concentration of substrate was used containing 5x 10 - 4 m cobalt salt which acts as stabilizing agents , stabilizer for enzymes and reaction temperature was 50 deg c.	9.704327334022656
If you substitute here the value of gamma here you will get e1 / .	12.747523950893044
So , at any conversion region , whether it is a small low conversion , low conversion , medium conversion or high conversion , the reaction medium will have in number , fraction in number , not the width in number wise maximum number of monomer present.	9.547512396483194
The concentration of your monomer by m t is a monomer present in time t divided by total initiator concentration which is given by the conversion m 0 by i 0, each initiator by one radical and one radical produces one chain.	9.216663597299142
Now , what is the , what is the problem if i have some , few cyclic molecules in , in the polymer at the end of the polymerization.	7.998750476290818
And we will talk about the other aspects of step growth polymerization in next lecture.	6.036085607179831
This pathway is represented by this and this.	8.806883375010294
For example in the case of cstr , life is much simpler; if the fractional conversion desired is very high even at a high initial substrate concentration , the substrate concentration in the reactor will be quite low and that is the substrate concentration which is going in the outlet stream.	7.984597037317574
Now , you commonly think polymer you know where you can take polymer that make polymeric material and then , heat it.	10.013642393119122
This primary radical react with a monomer r m dot.	9.593926662979934

Similarly in the case of a constant you will have another km value k a . kb + kb . a kmapp = ka + a here also this is your constant a.	7.827411694190914
The other examples , but i am not spending much time on discussing those applications here.	8.250684912669422
And , as we have learned in last lecture that to make a high molecular weight of this polymers , the polymerization has to be pushed with , such a way that to the conversion of the monomers or functional groups are very high , more than 98 person.	10.915197026333669
So , let us first talk about the chain backbone stiffness.	6.224128906151849
L / p and therefore the value of kappm gets altered by a factor of.	11.019773296244367

The hydrolysis of atp is a spontaneous reaction but in the absence of hexose it will hydrolyze only very slowly.	10.090018417290738
Here in addition to biochemical reaction you have another limitation.	11.63327226767209
You may reach closer to it as you increase the substrate concentration.	8.373100605091613
So , now , we know what is w m.	8.15829100820072
But the reaction might proceed at a very slow pace.	10.7583935667776
If this is the free enzyme which has two binding sites , identical binding sites the substrate molecule binds first to let us say , a.	10.71188852746623
Now this term we have already determined this term from flory - huggins equation in our earlier lecture and this is equivalent to if you can recollect from your knowledge.	10.32464173163211
If the rate of diffusion is slow in that case the diffusion will become rate limiting.	8.451602806797922
L /.	8.259689227874071
We will basically restrict our discussion mainly on multi angle light scattering and then we will just briefly mention the difference of small angle x - ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering with light scattering and what are the information you can get from and saxs and sans.	9.964515962716664
It is very difficult to predict.	7.562643852247083
We will talk about the polymer properties , thermosets which we talked about in the last page.	6.705833511040901
The paradox remains.	14.52767747162803
And it is also called emulsifier , because it is responsible for emulsifying the medium , so it is also calls emulsifier , and it is used at quite high concentration , if we remember the concentration of the dispersant in suspension polymers , it was around 0.01 weight percent.	11.409740487220065
We will discuss the techniques like membrane osmometry , vapor pressure osmometry , and end group analysis.	7.829927510953842
Polymer can be classified according to the applications.	9.711198914550046
So , as we increase the molecular weight , the solubility are miscibility between two polymers come down unless , there is a specific interaction , which makes the entropy of mixing negative , which happens here like polyphenyleneoxide and polystyrene.	8.665845324270212
Let us assume that the reaction follows the type of mechanism as indicated here k1 k2 k3 e + s es et e + p k - 1 k - 2 k - 3 it is a totally reversible reaction and you have the rate constant k1, k - 1, k2, k - 2, k3, k - .	7.275439617088833
Increasing the enzyme loading influences the increase in f , the thiele modulus.	10.896294277630744
Variety of methods has been employed and after cross linking is induced the whole network becomes water insoluble and the enzyme molecules are entrapped.	10.845593427443868
So , the rate of polymerization is also vary , if we cannot take out this the heat which is generated due to polymerization reaction that we did not consider did using at this steady state kinetics.	8.7441381673511
So , what will they do in next lecture , we will start form this case , and talk about types of copolymer it forms , and the microstructure of that resulting copolymers , and also talk about composition drift in this copolymerstion medium and copolymerstion reaction , and also talk about the reactivity.	9.850599187477222
We were talking about methods for immobilization of enzymes and in our earlier meeting discussed the first method called adsorption.	8.749292593097893
Now in this case , this will not be a planar.	7.590094459902014
The first substrate has reacted and released the product.	7.757356218976383
In the case of induced fit hypothesis one can also appreciate that in certain reactions for example even if there is reaction contaminant in the reaction mixture which are very similar to nature in the terms of their conformation to the actual substrate , they will not be able to interact.	10.105984255466307
It is either cationic species or anionic species.	8.324281048221932
The molecule is very compact.	10.594062105557322
Briggs and haldane hypothesis was regarding the steady state with reference to e - s complex.	11.122908102323587
So , n bar is half , so we can write m p by twice n a , now you have , if you have n p is a number of such particles , then total this is the total reaction rate will given the by the rates in individual particle multiplied by the total number of particles.	10.451141479919231
So , solubilising larger size polymers are always difficult compared to lower size polymers at a given condition.	9.44940813661899
Another set of conditions s2 we consider v.	16.203682917412817
For example here as you notice enzyme species can exist in the form of e , es and et in three forms.	7.950092080865845
In the fermentation broth if the concentration of the product or the desired enzymes is very low the cost is very high and second factor of cost is the application and the degree of purity you need for that particular application.	10.576091577720895
We also discussed various way of making branched and cross linked polymers.	8.515220600942524
This is the height of the reactor.	5.422715230488483
So if i write this side as head , and this is tail.	9.917743664422082
Then the last assumption is that there is no significant partitioning of substrate between bulk and the carrier phase.	7.288796746287932
Now , what we , what do you mean by size.	7.645215990535928
Now let us talk about the second factor polarity , let us have some example about poly - amides.	9.028024497230717
This is for ultimately the expression for we started from this intrinsic viscosity and we did this all the steps and finally reached here.	10.084726307023868
As if these molecules are dissolved in the polymer of this.	10.89877778694933
I write this as aa and this as bb.	10.205228462950704
This means you know also p which is close to .	8.145079094064668
But one parameter what is understood as storage stability which is attributed to the thermal deactivation of the enzyme with time is always favorable in the case of immobilized enzyme preparation mainly because of the additional intermolecular forces and the intermolecular forces that are involved which keep the process of deactivation to a minimum.	10.267695163637617
It is not going.	9.85870610082761
Now , we know , that we , we know , that we actually know all this things , but just to conclude this anionic polymerization part , but in practice what we need to do as we have seen , that the anionic polymerization is very susceptible to the impurities presents like oxygen , carbon dioxide , water , where if the moisture present , it immediately will kill the , kill the anion , carbanion.	9.190600208343783
Now , so this is all about the zeigler - natta polymerization.	6.84236535833776
So in general case , if you are talking about radical polymerization of or ionic polymerization where you have the counter ions are free , then the stereo chemistry of this carbon atom will be determined once the next monomer gets in.	10.00211189210684
So , if we use one calibration for the other sample there will be error.	9.722599039329873
The slope and the intercept are both increasing by a magnitude of 1 + i / ki.	7.327417835289132
In the monomer , if you start from a composition here say , this point because m 1 is getting incorporated faster.	9.174751930878177
You can easily take out the heat , because of the dispersing medium , so no such problem in case of , as in the case of bulk polymerization.	9.500960141946598
A quantitative analysis of the partitioning effect can be given in terms of a factor what we can call the partitioning coefficient , the partition factor which is the ratio of concentration of any specie on the enzyme active site divided by the concentration in the bulk if you consider the ph effects or hydrogen ion concentration it can be described in the two phases.	11.40654580331818
This ionic behavior results from the monomer units that are present in the amino acid which are present in the macro molecule and when we consider a long protein chain bulk of the amino groups and the carboxylic groups in the amino chain will be involved in the formation of peptide bond.	10.787111428434017
In the case of 1m ammonium fumarate it goes down by 50 % activity in twenty days time.	7.921140343697212
As the name suggests , competitive inhibitor combines with the free enzyme on the same site which is the substrate binding site and therefore the inhibitor competes for the binding site with the substrate.	9.920994612710395
So , even if you write simply m n it will understand , it will be understood by all of us , we are seeing that it is a average molecular weight , so number average molecular weight.	9.099486603401841
And for example , this halogenated or brominated aromatics , they emits hydrogen bromide during decomposition.	10.406228902137256
Now , we also can imagine tryads.	9.213444802238838
And , we take as earlier , di oxide plus diol gives you polyester.	8.819142853852156
Therefore the energy of activation will be reduced by that amount.	8.8651423448907
That means , it will be more broader.	9.369739516052073
The most commonly used method of cross linking the enzyme molecules is by the use of glutaraldehyde which possesses two aldehyde groups separated by a hydrocarbon chain , the three ch2 groups.	9.377938469162194
For p is 0.98 or 98 percent which correspondence to x n bar of 50 t is say , around 450 minutes.	10.747127362974542
So , during the reaction time the byproducts also taking part in the reverse reaction and also the intermediate chains they are also reacting with each other by exchange ester exchange.	9.354201599641323
The reasons for the two types of losses , the real and apparent , could be attributed to one or more of the following four factors that are listed here.	9.099899054601247
Let us , only from the concentration of the monomer you can find out , that if it is below 1, then rate of this , rate of cyclization will be higher and if it is above 1, this will be a fraction.	10.809245725113573
When he added with this alkyl aluminum plus some transition metal compounds.	10.935716655403096
So , if you increase the concentration during a radical polymerization , then you know the rate will increase , but of course at the proportional to the square root of the initiator concentration; and , if you increase the monomer concentration , then rate will be a increasing , rate of polymerization would be increasing in , as a direct , directly proportion.	9.428048495578015
Thus , because the e d for this reaction , for this initiation process is much lower compared to a thermal initiation process , that we , while discussion in the initiation , the types of initiation process we mentioned , that redox reaction , you can do it at lower temperature , that is because the activation energy for the initiation reaction is much lower compared to thermal initiator.	9.860546329676566
The phosphorylation of d - hexose at the expense of atp to hexose - 6 - phosphate.	9.210153990649504
Now this actually can , this is a very acidic proton , so it can be easily abstracted by an anion , which could be another chain end , the styrile chain end.	10.089135781524716
It could be a gel , it could be a micro capsule and there by you could provide them an environment which is very analogues to a living cell and then use them as immobilize preparations.	9.491639267938943
His observations were all based on hydrolysis of sucrose by invertase.	11.03758423408959
Now every case if you look the structure you can write yourself; for every repeat unit you have cis arrangement here.	11.80127939646186
It is a polysaccharide , negatively charged polyelectrolyte.	9.88217356171258
Even operational stability is improved; as i mentioned that the confirmation becomes very rigid.	10.201995339053266
The product inhibition is more detrimental in cstr compared to pfr because the concentration of product is much higher in the case of cstr.	7.964983022979831
Now , we can divide each molecule , which is represented as i into the segments and one volume; this is reference volume , which is the size of the individual cells in the 3d lattice.	9.524758327404104
So a variety of configurations had been used but some of them are purely of catalytic interest also.	10.383956591073996
So this is , for example , compare a polymer matrix , just plan polymer matrix , and a polymer matrix , with all this.	9.891951409219995
These are some examples.	7.838848875025683
So , reaction stops the polymers becomes classy , so no low reactions can happen.	8.960170800993142
The third effect on the enzyme catalyzed reaction of the temperature is the deactivation of enzymes.	9.965869473632102
In fact the efficacy of any drug or a therapeutic agent depends on its permeability through biological membranes and even the efficacy of a chemical drug will depend on it s ability to permeate through the biological membranes and reach to the site.	9.593359758249445
Now , we have just concluded , that if t goes up , r p goes up , we just concluded in our discussion few minutes back.	9.158556467692486
The structure of succinic acid is - ooc - ch2 - ch2 - coo -.	11.836760032285722
Although in the idealized reactor performance we have not taken into account but in the actual reactors they need to be taken care while analyzing the steady state reactor performance.	9.486373546147833
Let us go back and this e r value , it can be positive or negative and values is typically from minus 20 to 40 kilo joule per mole.	8.07061036713148
We will move to the next topic of molecular weight distribution.	5.776271710736515
Initially , it was n .	14.257361986458614
So , p is very close to 2, at most if your polymer molecular is low , it can be little lower than .	9.729972951780617
Now , what we are going to learn in next few lectures is that how to characterize.	7.490964395416982
Not always.	13.350771543395348
So , this one chain terminates , gets terminated by this side reaction and you can form branch in other growing chain.	8.388906651827405
The cost of production per unit quantity of the product comes down by over sixty nine point of total cost.	9.469586106213624
What is the function.	10.4541125613761
That means a modified enzyme substrate complex is generated and a first product has been released without the formation of a stable ternary complex of kinetic significance.	9.418510366998062
In this course i planned to cover the following topics.	10.68888349238742
So , as the polymer confirmation is changing all the time , you cannot have a fixed value of end to end distance , because this might have some value which is defined from this value , which is defined from this value.	9.211729074543177
For example , if i have these colligative properties , you know colligative properties , properties; these are like boiling point elevation of a solvent , freezing point depression , osmotic pressure , like this.	8.42536522143485
Now of course , you cannot throughout all the solvents unit solvent recovery and recyclic which is a very hazardous for this.	9.907289919283016
You know we we know about impact like , if you have just a glass then , if you hammer it , it breaks which means , the glass has a very low impact property.	12.00730460181801
This is the back bone.	7.894110259985521
This has a average number of molecules nu , this also have average number of monomer molecules nu.	11.594797347313515
The use of soluble enzyme may be fine if you have to analyze let us say couple of samples three or four.	12.625725084797436
That will depend entirely on ph.	9.882780136610483
If we land up a number which is lower than 100, then also a problem.	8.438346974355797
Now , what is 1.5, if you we can get this number , if we consider the number of , how many number of initiator residue present per chain.	9.82959119319962
I talk about , i will talk about the kinetics and the mechanism of different polymer processes which includes step growth and chain growth polymerization.	9.811018570063288
We have seen , that during are discussions we have covered everything now.	7.590979296634611
So , this proton can be abstracted by another propagating chain end and form . .. . . now , this is unreactive molecule , so this is one example by which , that polystyrile anion is self - terminating and finally ending into unreactive or terminated polymer chain , but these reactions are very slow.	9.354734298431662
And the other cases , where the opposite case or the reverse case where chi polymer solvent interaction parameter is higher than 0.5, it against mixing.	9.814863882181525
There is a third type of polymerization we talking about where is a heterogeneous polymerization it could be suspension or dispersion.	10.39005216526256
Their contribution is so low that you do not see any optical activity when you get to measure the optical activity of the stereo polymers.	9.983150912725197
What about the leathery part , b to c.	9.035487596709174
You have a silver anode and platinum cathode , a plastic membrane which is supposed to protect anode and cathode which separates the fluid from the internal fluid and after that we put an enzyme gel layer.	10.352601409145024
So , entire , during the entire process , polymerization process , this equilibrium exist.	9.665020918659053
That means between the binding sites introduction of a spacer arm which is usually a hydrocarbon chain and which can make the binding more flexible and there by the steric hindrances can be reduced.	9.564601615936098
That means the bulk concentration vary more than at the site of the reaction.	6.426742983066234
Now at any instance , the rate at which m 1 and m 2 is getting incorporated , in the copolymer chain , which will be given by the rate at which , this m 1 and m 2 is getting consumed.	6.707779635670792
Now , you are doing the bulk polymerization in the small droplets.	8.858259218218594
So , we can write intrinsic viscosity is equals to this term.	6.8688100338324345
I write this in the next page , it can react with the name and start the chain propagation reaction and i can write a generic expression of this in this way plus m kp n plus 1 m plus iz minus.	10.40932838195887
This is , this is probability density function which is the probability unit per volume.	11.209995083418386
He also proposed based on experimental observations that the reaction rate for an enzyme catalyzed reaction that is conversion of substrate into product follows saturation kinetics.	10.215587282876431
Then , we talked about copolymer composition equation.	8.273888540660309
So , if you start or anytime during your reaction , if your free monomer concentration is higher than the equilibrium monomer concentration corresponding to tact temperature , your reaction temperature , then what will happen.	7.589081832841935
With respect to x as the inhibitor you get a mixed inhibition.	11.968564913775706
If you now that , this is a statistical copolymer , then instead of co you can write stat in between , and if you know that this statistical copolymers is a random copolymer , which we discussed in the last lecture , then we can write ran r a n in between.	9.471762829372315
It is still utilized for say making styrene , poly styrene , poly methyl acrylate , poly vinyl chloride.	9.937278769451028
If we look into basic units of the international si system , a katal in terms of rate terms will be the quantity of enzyme that produce one mole of product per second.	9.561788938171535
So , what will be the average.	5.620588030256191
So , you know how esters are named.	8.841238669314059
So , polymer behavior , elastic behavior similar in high strain rate also , at temperature and high temperature and low strain rate , polymer demonstrate viscous behavior , and an intermediate temperature , the rate of and rate of strain polymer big demonstrate viscoelastic behavior.	10.004662291202235
If it is close to 0 then they the will monomer will produce the alternating microstructure , if they are close to 1 then the 2 monomers will produce a random copolymer.	9.323096538778751
But for linear flexible chains , it will be between 0.5 to 0.8 and for theta condition what we have seen earlier for theta condition , what is the value of a s or expansion factor for theta condition efficient.	11.176795938117666
It is similar to the assumption we made for step growth polymerization , the assumption of equal reactivity of the functional group.	6.886854455506168
So , if you compare , shall i pmma with a bp pc , which have a reflective index 1.594, then obviously the maximum transparence possible , for pmma is higher than a.	8.51611392484476
You can call it nad activated.	9.320292254009596
Then the choice of solvent is another feature.	6.715222463992288
So , what i may be , the calculation may be something may be little different , but what you understand what you know that , if you consider this r from , this four aromatic protons , and this form this three protons from tertiary , butylacrolate munities , then obviously , you can find out from the intensity ratios.	9.974234970893637
Because in case of ideal solution , we knew that phi i for ideal solution of small molecules phi i was equal to the mole fraction; volume of fraction was equals to mole fraction.	9.940320962545139
So , if i , will this branch react with any other chain growing chain.	7.888675222906033
Enthalpic contribution might reduce energy by 2 kcals.	15.161447088540267
Now , we will come to the mechanism of polymerization.	5.22093223525315
The route which these molecules will follow will depend on the relative km value of the two enzymes involved.	10.588193773079995
So adjustment of ph and taking advantage of solubility the l - amino acids can be easily crystallized and produced in a very pure state without much of head ache of removing proteins or deactivation of the enzymes or separation of unconverted d form.	11.005497765608496
Now , this is what we found we derived the flory - huggins equation where now this is gibbs free energy of mixing given by two terms this term was coming from purely combinatorial entropy and this is always negative.	8.811864072790717
Now , if we find any monomer there , which means that during the polymerization one or more than one monomers has escaped by volatilization.	9.915569322714052
It doesn t use the proteins only once.	9.550844163437946
And then we talked about the dependence of monomer structure on the value or the values of the del h and del s , the enthalpy change and the entropy change , how that those values depend on the structure of the monomer depending upon how the double bond in a monomer is stabilized or the polymer is strained or not.	8.884372439807487
And , some of the additives used are antioxidants , which basically prevent against oxidation; heat stabilizer , which prevents degradation of polymer under heat; light stabilizer , which basically protect the polymer from uv radiation.	9.633972121313885
So , we use to calibrate the detector with the toluene.	8.663407629349646
One of the most significant enzymes under this class is isomerization of glucose to fructose.	7.876964961464197
And it will remain dispersed because you have added in that reaction medium and dispersions which are typically water soluble polymers like polyethylene glycol or some inorganic particles which actually get absorbed on this particles and prevent them to coulis.	10.884327748877977
So , instead of like this we can write a 2 c plus a 3 c square like this where a 2 is nothing but this term.	9.643256005115754
So , how many molecules , how many chains polymer chains , 2 moles because each kinetic chain 2 of 2 of the chain to 2 chains will come and react and form 2 dead chains.	9.066597515132516
In the part b and c , you notice the combined effect of partitioning and diffusion.	9.37237788335281
Now , what is e x n .	9.552475091887832
Now 80 degree centigrade is actually below the tg , well below the tg of the pmma sample , so you should expect , the polymer should survive.	11.641983633107746
And then when the dimer is formed it can react with mono gives you trimer or it can react with itself to gives you a tetramer and this trimer can again react with monomer gives you a tetramer and so on.	9.009466279886041
The reaction temperature while it will control the reaction rate it will carry out the reaction at a slow rate and it has also been seen in the polymerization reaction that slower the rate degree of the polymerization can be taken up to a higher level.	10.658258990197334
The presence of certain unfavorable interactions at the active site for the substrate when the binding has taken place tends to distort the substrate molecule in the direction so that the enzyme substrate complex tends to become complementary to the transition state.	9.668259303095653
To elaborate this if we have say , this two or this two , because in all this cases the terminal group , or the monomer unit which is present at the growing in a same , all these will have same chemical reactivity for propagation reaction , so this is the assumption we are making in the terminal model.	10.168718873438733
The molecules with higher molecular weight will be retained.	10.008073289541457
So , and which will depend upon the temperature.	5.9948964694280065
So , if you discuss or understand one of them , the rest will be clear to you and all this gives because colligative property is based on the number of average molecular weight.	7.876021512296641
So , we showed the examples of alpha methyl styrene or 1 1 1 2 or 1 1 2 di substrate monomers like a mallian hydrie , where these radical polymerization becomes difficult and that is all any factor , kinetic factor also plays if the resulting radicals cannot approach each other , radicals produced or propagating radicals cannot approach a monomer.	10.042513947950251
Now , the some polymerization , for example , initiation by coordination or semi clock side , which also progress through an ionic species , propagating , propagates through ionic species route , but those we are not going to cover as an ionic chain polymerization.	9.062065867899483
Considering the time , we can say that , the top one is the rate of polymerization , rate of disappearance of monomers and the denominator is rate of formation of the radicals , which is nothing but rate of initiation reaction.	11.193272901429747
So , how this translates to the real number , let us look at this following data.	8.53090850630684
They are packed bed systems and achieving a perfect plug flow condition may not be feasible in large scale reactors while in the case of small scale reactors by manipulating or by increasing the length to diameter ratio one can achieve a much better plug flow behavior.	9.331531014637209
So , in summary if the solvent quality is good obviously , miscibility is high , the delta g mixing is less , and if solvent quality is good in a dilute solution this change will separate , they will be isolate to each other.	8.826944598624463
That means if you maintain same temperature and pressure and substrate concentration increase in the reaction rate constant by a factor of 4.58 x 103 fold can be achieved for every drop of 5kcal mol - 1 which is a very , very large.	8.99436726966093
Some systems like immobilized.	14.217477349936184
We will not like any substrate to remain unconverted because the cost of substrate is very high and even at the cost of productivity you go for higher fractional conversion.	8.34986050638154
The purpose is that the chemical species to be analyzed must have a specific recognition for the biological unit and the type of transducers that are very commonly used are amperometric or potentiometric electrodes and the recent year developments have been in the area of field effect transistors , thermisters.	9.465203484926992
So , for the experiments we know this n 0 or eta 0 is the solvent refractive index , d n by d c is the specific refractive index increment for the solute , lambda is the web length of the incident light , n a is avogadro number.	9.364513813048683
These are mostly oligomers which can be polymerized using uv light.	9.662605328793072
And it is the sample , and then you can detect the transmission transmitted light of the emitted light using detectors , and then you get the information about the sample from absorption spectra , emission spectra or a scattering like raman scattering.	10.59658350300073
As an alternative some people have even proposed to use a cstr where by one can use a stirred vessel , a classical system where one can maintain the substrate feed at a constant reservoir and an agitator pedal , a stone filter just to retain the immobilized enzyme particles and the material is filtered through this stone filter and passes through a peristaltic pump to a charcoal column which removes carbon matter or other impurities.	10.206939554922396
But still the surprising thing is that the concept is not totally invalid today.	10.00319102780635
For example , if you have like compare these two , this basically have very low reactivity because they are 1, 2 substituent.	8.32554339153416
And if they are think if this goes down so they are there equal and then we get these if they are different then r 1 r 2 will be closer to 0, producing a alternate copolymer which is in sink with our understanding , whatever we have discussed till now.	9.48479824940973
So , it consists of three steps : initiation , propagation and termination.	7.484077836500232
X is the number of molecule number of structural unit present in one molecule and n x is the number of such molecules.	7.362807866592241
So , i can put another constant k 1 and eta square because there is no constant term because this passes through the origin.	8.57472454607935
Now , how do you choose polymers , which polymer , sorry , additives for a particular polymers.	8.496148646396575
Hexokinase phosphorylate hexose to a hexose phosphate through involvement of atp , a very characteristic enzyme.	11.864134615469863
Now , onwards what we , i am going to discuss is , what is the procession , what are the process condition to make the high molecular rate successful step polymerization.	9.113516987394306
One of the major issues with hydrolysis of starch is in the form of the viscosity of the feed because starch hydrolysis is usually used at very high substrate concentration usually 30 - 40 % dissolved solids which makes very viscous syrup during operation and this viscosity causes a significant problem as for the pressure drop is concerned in packed bed reactors and therefore not many packed bed reactors for these steps are operational today.	9.455205994508972
This is the total number of segment , n 1 is the total number of molecules and we knew that the volume or size of a segment is same as the size of a solvent molecule.	7.029456475840334
Now , from a practical point of you , maybe , i will come in the next lecture , that what is the utility of these branches , branch formation or a cross link formation.	9.213691410094313
And as the result of this chain mobilities , a bunch of physical behavior or the mechanical , a property of this polymeric material changes , it becomes hard material , to a hard glassy materials to a soft rubbery material.	9.532721956248517
So , for the polymers which we already synthesized how what is the molecular weight distribution.	8.90846660908777
K2 e0 because all the n binding sites have to be saturated.	13.630343870893864
Now , if for for a polymer getting for polymers getting terminated by combination that means one polymer is getting formed from two kinetic chain.	8.887438448514866
You do the same thing , say , with ethylene oxide and then acidify , you get alcohol.	11.293795468504257
So , that is the rate of polymerization , and this can be increased by increasing n p which is the number of such particle , which is taking part in the reaction , that can be increased by increasing the surfactant concentration or by increasing the number of micelles.	8.224256315896522
If we increase the conversion further , then also the maximum of the number of chains having small number of functional groups , small number of structural units and maximum , but this difference comes down as we increase p.	9.4062314524236
In case of polymer solution , as we will see in a moment that , it is not only the combinatorial entropy; it is also the entropy change induced by the athermal process also contributes the gibbs free energy of mixing.	8.445390006926916
There are two major modifications which has been proposed in the case of plug flow reactors.	7.071553573252107
Then , it this will be skewed towards , it will be skewed towards the more reactive monomer.	8.572964592404402
We are holding the enzyme molecule bound to the substrate.	8.354839993010035
So , as long as we maintain pure environment where you reduce or minimize or make no termination reaction and your initiation rate is much faster compared to propagation step , then you can actually get assured , that the polydispersity in anionic polymerization would be very narrow , so less than 1.0.	8.754975236955183
The parameters , the equipment are all standardized thanks to many other products which are produced microbially that gives an edge for microbial biosynthesis of enzymes.	9.702506588599713
Using either of these plots , personally i recommend you cornish bowden plot , for any analyses.	12.899760118633063
That means also involves which enzyme we want and what are the source of enzyme and the carrier which is required to be used for any method.	8.893646736619797
As per their plan they regenerated their material.	9.948439617925587
But , in typically , one particular polymer can have one type of this deformation behavior for example , polymer gels have this type of soft and weak stressed in behavior , this is hard and brittle.	10.99760044324526
Now in terms of copolymers , that main advantage is that , the options are unlimited.	11.673185707168429
Today we will be talking about immobilized enzymes.	6.647997034477943
Now , if you apply the vacuum or reduce the pressure , then chances of you know vocalization of the monomers comes down.	8.236204361757155
Now , there is another way of synthesizing polycarbonate is by transesterification of this phenol with a diphenol carbonate in presence of base catalyst , base as a catalyst that gives us phenol as by product.	9.485474643428924
Now , this expression is satisfactory for , for homogenous and reactions in polar medium.	7.102830088971983
We learned in the first lecture , is the number of structure units present in the molecule or in a polymer chain.	9.980266665088267
Now , relook at this expression and we can , this expression and let us write from this expression , thus ln m e is del h 0 p by r t c minus del s 0 p by r.	10.397554184944969
So , what is happening here.	6.549912073767752
One is the transport of substrate from the surface to the enzyme active site and then reverse will be transport of product.	7.568720031809252
So higher the substrate concentration the thermal stability is more; its kd value is much , much less in the presence of substrate and the deactivation expression can be written as - de / dt = ( k'd / s ) . e here the deactivation rate is inversely propositional to substrate concentration.	9.147511174098739
And then i will discuss several or several different possible chain transfer reactions and their implications in terms of molecular weight and rate of polymerization.	8.593388868745638
Depending upon the reaction product , you can classify polymers as addition polymers or condensation polymers and depending upon mechanism of the polymerization , the process by which polymers are synthesized; it can be classified as chain step polymers or chain - growth and step - growth polymers.	10.337202018715276
So , yield strength and the elastic modulus is becomes higher , if it is a flexible back bone obviously , reforming deformation is much easier so , modulus comes modulus come down.	9.252194554702344
So , only this will take part in propagation step.	8.172735065553965
You can have also steric effect affecting the monomer ratios.	9.060455277318695
If they are not able they are not biodegradable then if base whether they can be recycleable again to meaningful product or if they are not biodegradable or recyclable then how they the waste can be managed.	11.190207088144216
Again i am saying this is not a example of a perfect viscoelastic material , but this is what , i have in hand , at this moment to demonstrate , so i am trying with whatever available at home.	11.605169980250405
So , you have to be very careful , not having any presence of the , this impurities.	8.278682890662077
Another method which is very popular is loury s method which is based on the production of a blue purple color which absorbs maximum at 660nm with a sodium tungstate molybdenum phosphate reagent what we call as fallacy of call to the reagent which is usually a standard which is available and reagent is very accurate in the sense that you can monitor the protein concentration as low as ten milligram per litre.	10.444248970272907
So there is something going on and keeping those data in view koshland proposed a hypothesis as late as 1958 what we understand today as koshland induced fit model.	9.646005389573471
But enzyme loss can be there big time , over a long period of time.	6.656067752686319
In the case of urea , urease is the enzyme , immobilization method is polyacrylamide gel and ammonium ion electrode is used , ion selective potentiometric electrode and the range is one to ten micro molar.	9.25310845025069
See because of so many reasons.	12.033204384147144
In that case also , you can use the same expression which we got in the last page.	7.275878998086384
Two other very interesting examples also came in almost during the same time in 64 and 6.	13.050976194995663
See , this is specific case as a polyethylene , this is structure units , and repeat unit is this.	12.205638535714955
On the other hand in the case of a first order regime the performance of pfr , if you look from the point of view of fractional conversion the fact of fractional conversion on the quantity of enzyme required or the value of the space time , to be able to compare the reactor performance , what we need is to look at two different things : the fraction of conversion and the quantity of enzyme required.	8.703750639480859
But in many cases this may not be so.	9.172072717879255
Now , i hope you can you can get this , if we just look at this , that if i have a if i have a propagating radical having a active species here , if i have a if i have a radical here at the end of a propagating chain , i have another radical at the end of the propagating chain.	8.963809311741173
Now , we will move on and try to find out the value of entropy of mixing.	6.863279134420204
It is defined as the minimum concentration oxygen , expressed as percentage by volume; a volume percentage in short , in a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen that will sufficient , enough to support flaming combustion of a material.	10.157672199090209
If you consider polar solvent , that means , the ions are either solvent separated or they are free anion and in that case , the salvation , the separation ion , separation is , is , is more feasible for a small ion like lithium , a small cation for lithium because lithium will be much more solvated in a polar solvent compared to a larger size ion , cation , like cesium cation or a potassium cation.	9.921413255499761
So , with this , i come to the conclusion of this course and thank you , for being with me with this course and good luck to you.	8.679454372809118
To illustrate with example the insoluble substrates are like hydrolysis of cellulose.	10.939700913950428
Now this rate constant can write k p m this is rate constant for reaction between a propagating polymer radical p and a monomer m is given by these expression , where this 2 terms are the reactivity measure of the reactivity of the polymer like radical.	11.161748035756224
When you carry out the enzyme reaction in an organic solvent the role of ph becomes limited in the sense that as we saw earlier in the effect of ph in enzyme kinetics , the major role was ionization of the amino acid residues in the enzyme protein.	9.410433340365053
Disproportionation , 2 of these.	14.393182490391368
If you look at the performance of some of the enzymatic catalyst as compared to chemical catalyst , you will notice that enzymes provide very efficient catalyst.	8.473064485299846
The alternate to that is use of immobilized urease and this is an example of an artificial organ which is commercialized which is available commercially and with such a system a patient doesn t have to go hospital because the volume of dialysate they require is only about a liter which he can safely install at the site of his bed in the house and use himself.	11.178565987638716
That means one should ensure what is the site of action required.	12.71233975619184
So , what you need to find.	6.761069655166699
Here , the rate of polymerization depend on the square of this monomer concentration where in case of radical polymerization , if you remember , is the , it was related to the concentration of monomer.	10.132450056058515
Identical means the catalytic sites have identical free energy change of binding.	12.492156002970143
Now we can write; so you get this expression.	6.257462447697973
When i say km i am referring to k - 1 + k2 / k.	8.677776182626923
In this case , the polymer molecules is much higher is very different.	8.929591335480502
One of the most commonly observed mixed type of inhibition is what we call as linear mixed type inhibition.	7.700414072624322
If more stabilization means lower value of del h which means lower value of t c and the higher the strain , that means higher is the energy of the polymer again the lower is the magnitude of the del h value.	9.357834971573133
This polymer , which is also known as macromonomer because it can act as a monomer and start polymerization once more time physically with micromolecules behaving like monomers , so we often call this as a macromonomer.	11.503039147833494
In fact michaelis menten himself never proposed or gave the name as michaelis menten constant.	8.018313215995278
Now , it can undergo further polymerization from here and form a chain here so it can undergo here and form a chain.	8.463292878203985
This is nothing else but cross linked dextran molecules.	7.806142162523004
I am using a general term reaction environment mainly because while most of the reactions are to be carried out in aqueous medium today there are requirements that many of the reactions may be carried out in organic non - polar medium.	9.414147122837417
Again the number of ways you can arrange different solvent molecules is one.	7.564201152713542
Now if you think about the pure elastic material , if we stretch a crystalline solid what happens.	8.391814103303702
Now , what is the reason that this monomers are difficult to polymerize.	7.732025445590743
But in many enzyme catalyzed reactions the k2 is very , very small compared to k - .	7.4268005448054755
This is not the minimum hydrogen ion concentration but is the value of this function f which is minimum.	9.08878857687623
Instead of equilibrium behavior they mentioned in the case of rate terms a steady state behavior.	10.224486394219047
Sb - ss is the concentration gradient across the thin film.	10.711524362247653
For example , if i consider a h and then plot a h verses say t , we will have the discontinuity in the in this variation of a h with temperature.	7.83441762635158
Otherwise it was difficult earlier because if the substrate is coming in the solution form in an organic solvent you need to remove the organic solvent put into water medium and then carry out the reaction which is practically not feasible but which can be made feasible if you use the advanced enzymes in the organic medium.	10.391421102733467
When we are talking of enzyme and two substrates there is a quite logical choice that we might end up instead of binary complex , a ternary complex where e , a and b all the three are combined together before a product formation takes place.	9.937591829850083
Alternatively you can also give a pulse input also called as delta input where over a very short period of time that means your.	10.962827555873005
So , the slower the heating , you will see the decomposition temperature , at lower temperature , where as higher heating will take to higher temperature , basically polymer cannot follow , the heating , if you are doing the heating in much faster rate , the polymer cannot follow the heating profile.	10.02168183114981
Only initially we feed the reactor and at the end of the reaction time the output is taken out.	7.935610311152864
That is the reactor output instead of going directly to the product stream passes through ultra filtration unit in which the product stream is filtered out and can be taken out of the product stream while the retentate which contains mainly the enzyme is recycled back into the reactor.	10.779364356246369
Now , before we start getting the expression for enthalpy of mixing , just one point just to highlight that this is the expression we received or deduced for entropy of mixing for a polymer solvent.	8.763892021836236
Bond energy is not that high and therefore even under ambient conditions by attack of another molecule they can further be broken down to the resulting products.	11.642404042974064
This is another mechanical property testing , we just discuss all last few minutes about tensile basically , the stresses is applied in a longitudinal direction.	10.165503230904722
So , when we deduce this expression , we did not consider that these vectors have volume , so what happened the same space in this model , we consider that same space which are the intersection points can be occupied by the two two two bonds.	9.850574475046372
Now , this has a very high ability to stabilize this radical.	7.109877042074298
So , if you talk about mechanical property , then after the exposure , the mechanical property like , impact tension strength , there is a compact or the ductility.	8.803674626285666
Now , when you have a distribution to characterize or to represent this sample having different polymer molecules of different sizes you have to mention the average mass , average molar mass , we will say the mixture of several molar mass molecules you have to mention a average and also the distribution.	10.179334378239188
These ones are perpendicular to the plane of paper to indicate a three dimensional network and the enzyme being entrapped within the space.	10.684456100667038
For polymers the segment has to be tied up because there the segments are joined to each other.	9.938639499085186
If you couple polythene glycol , the whole enzyme molecule becomes soluble in non - aqueous phase and then it can be put into an organic medium and then it behaves almost like a soluble enzyme but in non - aqueous phase.	9.409965765720255
So , they actually increase in the polymer , increasing the restriction.	10.393521130596064
Under this condition i am trying to give you an analogy or an explanation as to how ka and k a are related.	10.24194653648
The mixed inhibition is a special case of non - competitive inhibition where otherwise substrate concentration does not influence the degree of inhibition.	6.878947219150171
The enzyme active site as soon as it comes in proximity , it wraps around the substrate molecule.	8.077958009958342
These are supposed to bind with x , y and z which are the amino acids residues on the active site.	7.628102686406719
Very often broadening of the output is one of the major problems.	9.34487923962116
The fluids have very strong conditions for example the fluid in the stomach will have a very low ph.	11.22896691229815
Then 5 and again strain comes down.	8.218744503890166
Total number of monomers polymerized , which is 600 moles that is a number of monomers polymerized.	12.117449683943779
Thank you.	17.98328929683109
Now we will discuss , or define this term , clarity and haze in a minute.	8.585809592039226
If this is the large molecule then conformation changes also may produce or the change the fluctuation in concentration which will give us the fluctuation in the scatter intensity.	9.79727879297898
It will be important to notice that the sharpness of the profile of the ph versus reaction rate will also depend on the proximity at which the pk value of the different amino acid residues lie.	11.089856025399966
They are cross linked and frozen.	9.412820959154972
The negative and positive charges are equal.	9.366690475596966
Now , this value indicates that for every 10 degree rise , there is around two to three fold , two to three times increase in the rate of polymerization.	8.276886802782068
It has very good resistance to aqueous basis and acids , but there is some problem , disadvantage in polystyrene structure too because it is an aromatic structure.	10.159943800216631
We know del g 0 standard gives energy change for polymerization r t c ln k , where k is the equilibrium constant.	8.565566377339712
But if effectiveness is the same the cost is the principle determining factor.	9.878276905909512
Delta h m is melting is always endothermic processes , so this is a positive value.	10.909982560366041
Now , what about the polydispersity.	7.301392807789336
As expected in the case of soluble enzyme there is no recovery of enzymes and the cost of the enzyme in the case of immobilized process is very , very small almost negligible compared to this.	9.354232381852027
This intrinsic viscosity is k by m.	10.233865619840302
They are used for understanding reaction thermodynamic parameters and other mechanistic aspects.	9.1809859696487
Now , you can justify these in , this way , that once you increase the temperature , the more and more radical gets generated for a given time , like more and more radical gets generated , then more and more polymer forms for a given time.	9.17034121067758
If you can couple an enzyme preparation to a matrix , an insoluble matrix , which is not soluble anyway couple whereas the enzyme activity is retained and this being an insoluble matrix , a particulate matrix , one can pack it into a column or one can use it in a stirred reactor and give a feed continuously and take all the product stream continuously.	10.44290336863812
Similarly , the chances of this type of carbonate linkage is given by again 0.25 and individually these two are again 0.25, so together they get 0..	8.302186914480586
And , that is done by adding secondary anti oxidant.	9.277808819785546
We get a profile.	11.755605449672819
In the absence of magnesium ions the enzyme will not be functionally catalytically active and therefore these activators function by participating or facilitating in either enzyme substrate binding or in stabilizing the enzyme substrate complex.	8.664076143665646
To the ester molecule a water molecule is added.	9.863841822661309
Then we will go on to the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions because reaction kinetics will play a very important role in the choice of enzyme reactors , to understand reaction rates and the role of associated physico - chemical interactions that will take place once you immobilize the enzyme or use them in bulk environment other than water.	9.967273103012488
Now , here typically its strong protonic acids like say tri floro acetic acid or say fluoro sulfonic acid or say triflic acid which are the way this , this are our acids which are very strong acid are required to initiate a ring opening polymerization.	9.752004238274104
One wants a sparkling clear beer and this clarification or what they call as the term chill proofing is done by immobilized papain , a proteinase enzyme which is immobilized and used in a column because it degrades polypeptides or even polyphenol oxidase also have been used or a mixture of the two so as to degrade those molecules and remove the haze which can be filtered and clarified beer is available.	11.065334973745616
Other is heterogeneous polymers like inversion suspension polymerization , is exactly the opposite inverse of suspension polymers , where the monomer is water soluble , and the dispersion medium is organic solvent.	10.994861358621044
And if it is substitution is bulky , so like if you have a biphenyl ethylene , one ethyl ethylene , then it is very difficult to polymerize , and if you have tri substitute or tetra substitute , then also its very difficult to polymerize.	9.207195574937476
So it is said that , you can basically choose any two co monomers , which in most cases can polymerized radically , but if you want to use any of this cationic or anionic technique then the number of pairs of co monomers you can choose are limited , as we discussed in during our chain polymerization discussion.	11.096995013743593
What is structure units.	10.935018313766168
What is the concentration of co group and h 2 o at equilibrium.	10.018956406874837
In case of kramer this is negative , so the slope will be negative.	8.426966833821222
And these polymers are formed from monomers by polymerization different polymerization techniques.	9.554899399445057
Now , let us consider first a single bond; the simple bond , one bond , if you one bond like this; now , the other one , in case of freely rotating , in case of freely rotating chain , you can place it here , you can place it here , or even you can place it here.	9.282327424715437
It will happen for most of the basis.	10.666108887496234
Because they are competing on the same side , if the concentration of substrate is much , much larger than inhibitor then the possibility of substrate molecule binding to enzyme is much more and once substrate molecule is bound the enzyme will no longer be available for inhibitor to act upon.	10.494339085519014
You need a soluble enzyme.	7.120234145133746
In this case we talked about chain transfer to counter ion.	7.508627606083652
How do you induce crystallinity in the material.	9.309430842178498
So , that is , let us , vinyl acetate , 1 into 10 to power minus 9 moles per liter; methyl acrylate , moles per liter; methyl metacrylate; styrene , moles per liter and alpha methyl styrene , 2.2 moles per liter.	8.077450233109078
Plastics is meaning formable.	17.131348432477917
And cohesive density energy is nothing but measure for the interaction or attractive interaction between the molecules.	10.158152365110318
You see that the active site here unlike the lock and key mechanism is not exactly complementary.	8.883705446960208
In the case of therapeutic products , the choice is not on the basis of cost but on the basis of its need if it is a life saving drug.	9.426907670379254
As i mentioned earlier , that this is your rate determining step , so the rate constant for this reaction is considered.	9.502762531211008
We have also not considered the deactivation of the enzyme on the reactor performance.	6.844464207768635
Though the sizes of this species are different , but the final reaction is between oh group and cooh group for a polyester exhibition reaction.	11.633293125152717
It has been shown at least empirically in a large number of experimental data that jd is equal to jd = c ( re ) - n a very general relationship for jd factor has been given that it s a function of renault number to the power minus n and under different conditions of particle shape and the range of renault number the magnitude of c and n varies and that can be estimated for a particular system.	10.02506006308665
So when we say retention of catalytic activity you are implying that a major fraction of the activity must be retained.	10.020816044419568
We talk about the molecular weight distribution and we will talk about different processes , different polymerization processes for radical polymerization.	8.036293587252578
H - t.	8.840850777355998
And , generally , this small organic additives , they worked by sacrifices , sacrificial mechanism; by meaning , by terms sacrificial mechanism meaning , that they do destroy themselves and protect the polymer , the main polymer which you want to maintain or retain.	10.848422537425051
Mechanism of the reaction is that you have a base catalyst reaction , so you have this molecule addicting to this carbonate group nucleophilic attack and the reaction starts from there.	13.072972960627851
As far as study of reactor system is concerned , we are not measuring the enzyme activity every time.	9.791972579857488
If the km value of the subsequent binding sites decreases with the binding of the first substrate molecule we call it co - operative binding.	9.258953495828678
It can never be more than .	7.96233445566608
To get a higher surface area you have to reduce the particle size which also has a great limitation of use because of the smaller the particle size its use in a packed is difficult because of the high pressure drops.	12.302622237615308
But turn over number for most of the enzyme catalyzed reaction varies in the order from 10 - 104 per second.	10.281355201591136
So , that might have in few cases , where the monomer can take part in homiletic cleavage and generate radical , or it can react with some other molecule , initiator molecules and produce the radical.	9.302683478728829
So , that is the rate equation and the molecular weight would be given by the total number of monomers is reacted.	7.589109610618526
Similarly , if i have a , say 25 a; a is to be 25 and 75, then chances of forming a o c o o a will be 0.25 multiplied by 0.25; a o c o o b , 0.25 into 0.75 again; twice because for the other way round and for b o c o o b will be 0.75 into 0.7.	9.460602250887643
You fix a temperature for your reaction and you start with a monomer concentration , which is lower than your equilibrium monomer concentration , which means , the reaction will not go.	10.883635621762735
The second characteristics feature of the effectiveness factor is that it is inversely propositional to particle size.	9.358353942099257
So , from this example where we can find out the composition of the copolymer , and what is the copolymer in this case it is , it can be seen it is more of course , syndiotacttic copolymer.	8.72746735573483
So , to a for a successful step polymerization , successful by mean in a by successful , i mean to build a high molecular at you have to have a condition , where r is also close to .	8.708258050046876
Now , initially before the steady state happened m dot increase slowly before it steady state happen.	9.07422228351991
If it is to be required to be used in the.	7.583307927880913
For the sake of writing the rate expression i named as p and a and in the case of a it is inhibited competitively.	9.328654825502644
That means ultimately they will tend to reduce the rate of reaction and provide a poisonous effect on the rate of reaction.	7.771940961955165
We will discuss the specific example in a minute now.	7.85991351452574
And with increasing the chain length , the molecular weight , the contribution from the ends goes down progressively.	8.525655156176587
So , high temperature is required to , to facilitate , to make the reaction faster.	7.678711209645423
The rate will pass through a maximum when the function is minimum and at this concentration of hydrogen ion the reaction velocity will pass through a maximum.	9.98167997073957
So , flexible backbone gives lower modulus and strength , and chain stiffness of the backbone and the bulky side groups , increases modulus , and strength which is self - explanatory.	9.042613650414683
So you get the two expressions for cstr the general reactor performance expression and also under conditions of zero order and first order scenario.	9.839535989451697
The current generated is reflected by dissolved oxygen concentration because on the cathode it is the oxygen which takes up the protons generated on the anode.	11.471434467933197
Now , the main factors : the t g depends on the free volume.	9.005351445590534
And now once you know the value of tau s we know this and we know from this expression this , so we know k p k t.	10.64892815144653
I am just writing the kappa values right on the arrow so that while writing the rate expression it will be easier.	10.07153002573797
This loss , if it is a let us a physical quantity like protein concentration the balance will be perfect.	10.759205298049341
This is immobilized enzyme.	6.77614362901638
So , the reactivity of that radical will come down.	5.805803878068844
Either half life during storage that means the time in which the activity loses to fifty percent of the original activity or during use in a continuous reactor or in a batch reactor that is in terms of number of cycles.	11.787721443056855
In fact most of the enzyme catalyzed reaction that do take place in a living cell involves two substrates in most cases.	7.440562669255865
They retain the catalytic activity.	9.497745774095367
And you know , less number of monomers can be polymerized cationically , and there are even lesser number polymers , which can be polymerized by both anionic and cationic polymerization.	8.783277199786959
And , once the bond cleavage starts , you can get lots of chemical bodies forming , which absorb the uv , visible near , uv visible range forming yellow colour of the polymer.	9.431925765011982
Because , the concentration of this monomers is quite low , so they can only form oligomeric species , and also this oligomeric species oligomeric species or oligomeric radical , propagating radical they are also not soluble in water.	9.22917494233734
Now , reasons for blending , as we quickly , as we have just mention this improvement with , for the base polymer develop in broad property range of material , dilute or high cost engineering resins and so on.	9.657829050718894
So , these are the possible , depending upon the polarity of the medium this could the four possible association state between these two ionic species.	7.0406936088597
I will cover in brief the reaction of polymers which include polymer degradation , stabilization and also polymer modifications and at the end i have planned to brief you about few new topics , and special topics and new development in polymer chemistry and at the end i will complete with a summary of this course.	9.888000292118443
Calcium has been most commonly used so instead of sodium alginate you end up in calcium alginate which is water insoluble.	11.085114608001826
Today we shall discuss the performance of enzyme catalyzed reactors , the reactors in which enzyme catalyzed reactions are supposed to take place . you will recall earlier we had discussed some of the salient features of different reactor types ranging from batch reactors , batch stirred tank reactors to continuous stirred tank reactor or plug flow reactors and fluidized bed reactors.	9.636141094666334
So , but the trend will be mentioned so absolute values of this monomer q and e value might change , but the trend will always remain same depending irrespective of the condition.	10.046786466330934
It gives you the distribution of the various elements of the fluid passing through a reactor.	9.277483838714758
So , once this is formed , this cannot reinitiate or this cannot actually take part in further propagation reactions , which means , this chain actually gets inhibited by this type of reaction.	8.393728783032202
You can increase the reaction rate or we can make the reaction more feasible.	8.74310724431477
We will continue from these , and talk about termination reactions or transfer reactions.	7.727982851850559
Now , look at the values of alpha methyl styrene , that is , 2.2 moles per liter.	7.526758171513982
What is the advantage of this mono functional group.	7.841952199078962
So , the so , the modulus also changes with temperature generally , molecular modulus decreases with increasing temperature of the thermoplastics and at t g and t m , the modulus decreases suddenly at t x added t g and t m.	8.412363701213714
We know that the enzymatic catalytic function has two key roles : one is binding of the substrate and then certain catalytic function.	8.031479655712763
Now , how can you think of which one is dominant product or which one is not a dominant product.	9.386201891930865
Now , there are few definitions of viscosity you should know this , these are common name of different viscosity , and these iupac name , these are most still now common names are used by many people , actually more people uses this common name than the iupac names.	10.22179218773322
These two groups participate in hydrogen bonding with water , but because this is hydrophobic group to hide this hydrophobic groups from water , the waters form , water molecules form structured around this hydrophobic group which we call hydrophobic hydration or cage formation and results , you get a negative entropy.	10.240504009627198
If you compare taking to different groups , where they are this electron deficient and this is electron rich , then they will tend to be forming alternate copolymers.	8.800390818884294
This is eta is the viscosity of the solution of a concentration , of a polymer concentration c at a given solvent and given temperature , whereas eta 0 is the viscosity of that solvent that particular temperature , so this eta by eta 0 or the relative viscosity is gives by the extent of increase , in the viscosity by the addition of polymer at a concentration c.	10.317352319674091
Now , the simple monomer is all polyethylene and polyethylene is synthesized at high pressures and temperature above the melting temperature , its melting temperature.	8.338056004930467
Because , the contact angle between the water and the polymeric surface is very high so , it basically rolls off and giving the strolling of process , it can take away that , they are the impurities , which are present in the surface.	11.199062637364529
The general concept that the enzymes have certain substrate binding sites on molecule but conformationally it is more complementary to the substrate transition state and that was the contribution which was stated in very clear terms by linus pauling that enzymes are molecules that are complementary in structure to the activated complexes of the reactants they catalyse.	11.136382660411876
So , if we just go back and see what we have seen , now we know the entropy of mixing of a polymer solution and polymer plus solvent is truly , now in this case , the entropy is truly a combinatorial entropy.	8.207626367217093
For example , polysaccharides which represent cellulose , starch , cotton , biopolymers , proteins , nucleic acids , wool , silk and so on and say , natural rubber , cis - 1, 4 - isopolyisoprene.	9.70884777300465
So , the molecular of structure units twice the molecular repeating.	7.724223069978036
That , all these rate constant for all these propagating reactions , they are same.	9.723662324803465
We talked about the glass transition temperature , and melting point earlier.	6.059626220058709
So , now this is regenerated.	6.6167065466624395
The other effect of this immobilization is on the kinetic parameters.	7.893577540353066
So , basically upper limit for determination is becomes lambda dash by 2 where lambda dash is the wavelength of the light in that particular medium.	7.942441233769233
It takes a very long time and that is the process very often many people use in laboratories.	12.001431928588998
So , it will also be a , but the degree of may be lower than most flexible chain like polyethylene.	9.914321356217014
That means by itself your reaction has to be very highly reactive , so that by itself without removing the byproduct , you can get the product.	10.039489725400356
So this is one example of normal alkanes as shown , that with increasing the chain length number of carbon atoms , the t m values goes up and eventually it is become a steady value.	9.196042022117327
So , modeled in stress is basically bad , for a polymer to be resistant , to a chemical.	10.846016157567448
So you have only one pattern for eab that is k1a , k2b and k.	9.127438951924873
In practice while we get a preparation which is highly stable , we also get a significant loss of enzyme activity.	9.068639721944235
Now , where how do you get these polymers.	8.668007829055583
So , this is a specific case , this , this example is not , there are many many case.	8.466617688409245
So , this is what i was discussing in in just a minute that , with a for a semi crystalline polymer with increasing crystalinity at the modules goes up elastic modules goes up.	7.899639616043477
By analyzing these parameters one can distinguish if the magnitude of k a is zero and one can conclude that the reaction mechanism under study follows the binary reaction mechanism.	9.947241109677027
Apparently it may look as if enzyme is doing something which is not allowed by a chemical thermodynamics but in practice it is not so because the reaction is catalyzed in association with another hydrolytic reaction which is energy yielding , which has a much higher negative free energy change and that is hydrolysis of atp to adp and inorganic phosphate.	11.605836527090798
In such case if you can have an enzyme preparation which has either a neutral or a slightly acidic ph optimum it is desirable.	11.604104551500036
The first and probably the most common feature could be the shift in equilibrium.	7.142795131597023
When you take the whole particle in account then the bulk of the particle experiencing lower substrate concentration means higher reaction velocity and so therefore this ratio will become more than one or in other words if you take two particles one of larger diameter other is smaller diameter the reaction rate in the larger particle may be more than in the smaller particle.	10.437479260707088
Now , if the value of this x 1 or x 2 goes up , the value of entropy mixing goes down.	7.851340063423246
And then we will talk about feasibility of chain polymerization , how the structure of monomers determines , which type of initiator would choose , and different modes of propagation of a free , in a free radical polymerization , different types of initiator and initiator efficiency.	9.472724837559717
So , if the polymer while vaporization is gets fragmented or degraded then while we get the molecular ion distribution , we do not know the distribution is because of the fragmentation or degradation of the high polymer chain or because of the actual presence of the low molecular weight chain in the samples.	9.411278877456793
The other altered physico - chemical properties are optimum ph and specificity.	8.76329673575271
They are fast; they are about , say , 10 to the power 4 to 10 to the power of 6 times of the reaction rate of radical chain polymerization.	7.4661061462635825
So , you can basically extend this graft polymer into another dimension to get brass copolymer.	7.438734967340382
That means processing cost can be much lesser that is you have to put a much lesser protein for achieving the same catalytic function.	8.920504492277843
You know they are used for very high in the application where you require very high temperature to sustain even kepler has a melting point which is higher than 500 centigrade , sometimes it even burn before it melt.	9.317123134369186
So if you can follow any of this property with temperature , we can find out the glass transition temperature , and melting point.	7.720888603581924
Now , this , this is the different monomer all together compared to the original methyl methacrylate monomer.	8.91897200503232
And , these unstauration or the terminal chloride , terminal chlorine , resins of terminal chlorine arises due to the chain transfer reaction during polymerization.	9.176685503091122
So , that gives the importance of the equilibrium constant in a reaction in a step polymerization reaction that you always prefer.	9.105136506763579
The chemical species which needs to be analyzed is anylate.	9.742552159527824
So what are factors that influence the value of melting point or melting temperature.	9.084683729264675
For example , if you want to use some medical devices you know you in medical devices , like cringes and some other medical component like you most cases before use they are sterilized by applying some spirit rectified spirit , which contains alcohol.	8.432753352491375
I should think about the lower values of p , 97 percent , or even 9.	13.239359328453395
Total mass of the sample n i is the number of moles having molecular rate of this.	9.88594252959035
Before that let us go through few practical points and for example , for organic solvent the beads are typically used as cross linked polystyrene or surface - treated silica gel and for aqueous medium porous beads of cross linked water soluble polymers are used.	9.98738328381601
Obviously , we want to use this polymer for some applications.	7.962706906183981
So , we will discuss a little bit of maldi tof now.	7.759309549880139
So , what we have done in this lecture.	7.519076025631135
The other complication arises like increasing a viscosity or lot of heat generation.	10.330111284765
We are carrying out reaction in cstr and when the reaction goes on , the product formed is sent out as the permeate in the ultra filtration cell and the enzyme and the polymer bound coenzyme is retained in the reactor and the substrate can be fed continuously by pressure gradient in the reactor vessel and the reactor can be continued over a long period of time.	8.57218337456897
Probably the very first step at which the temperature influences is the interaction of enzyme substrate complex , an equilibrium process , you know is a reversible equilibrium process.	11.00840094452323
If there is a transfer reaction is happening with the monomer.	7.6765397819372145
There are n 0 minus x i number of vacant cell.	8.136588641401438
We have seen in the previous pages.	7.480766670822775
If you write the double reciprocal equation for the same thing , what we wrote earlier 1 / vo = km / vm ( 1 + i / ki ) . 1 / s + 1 / vm if you plot 1 / s verses 1 / vo you get a series of profiles with increasing i.	7.425120917750966
So , it actually often cannot reinitiate anionic polymerization and even it does , it actually slowed down the reaction a significant way.	8.841625340121984
They have become very important tool both in diagnostics as well as monitoring of information from reactions.	10.669709957057101
In the first case when we are talking of constant b your profile will be something like this.	6.226603358511135
No . sorry diffusional coefficient will come here.	8.19804771150887
Now , they can get terminated by other type of reaction , disproportionate reaction as well.	7.937584245303141
He can immediately take a decision to either switch on or switch off or terminate; whatever decision has to be taken on the plan and in those cases such systems are very , very useful.	10.701466913245962
So , what we will do in the next lecture we will start discussing about the other methods of determining molecular weight namely m n and m w and other polymer solvent interaction parameters.	6.257005452315463
It can be microorganism , it can be a plant or it can be animal.	11.262241320653578
So , k p , m , f k d , i , k t , to the power half.	6.099672305105543
But when higher fractional conversions are required the problem becomes more and more serious because the product concentration is high when the fractional conversion required is high and therefore in those cases the plug flow reactor becomes almost a necessity.	10.462745310811028
Eventually it will lead to that.	11.012209470901187
For example is example of metallocenes , where you have two side; two cyclopentadienyl coordinated with , attached with iron.	10.72262047762406
This one here it is k1s and k - 2, k - 2.k - 3p and k1s and k.	10.827469127400187
Now in this lecture itself , we basically completed our module on polymer synthesis.	9.345045651519984
The method remains the same as we have talked about the enzyme molecules.	8.718779005519863
The binding energy should be distinguished from the energy of activation.	6.746436242805777
How do you get molecular x from , you got x n average degrees of polymers from this; you can get experimentally , p , q , can experimentally determine the fraction of molecule present.	10.065685264336956
You can express it in a mechanistic way the enzyme going to ea or eb and eab and this four this will go in cyclic form.	9.604627335503633
I will illustrate with some of the examples.	8.38570309150142
In the most , most cases except when r 1 is r 2 is equals to 1 or r 1 and r 1 r 2 is .	8.251639194807003
So , basically in this case this two molecules this two carbon atom has different configuration.	7.66608101815302
Then unless you have the temperature lower than theta , you will not get the solution.	11.78748726193849
In those cases , the polymer surface comes in contact with biological fluid now , the surface of the polymer should be such that , it should not interfere the normal biological processes or it should not basically introduce , or start the coagulation process in the biological fluids.	10.267861015713397
Third is the intrinsic viscosity of i chain is given by k m i a; that means what we are assuming that k and a values are independent of the molecule.	10.05012059516063
What does this table means.	11.373907594149589
If the water is stripped off or is not present then the reaction can go in the reverse direction and instead of hydrolysis , synthesis can be used and in fact it is in this area a very significant application have emerged where the ester synthesis has been carried out even commercially in fact for some of the very high value products.	10.785730079277274
A polycarbonate would be called lexan by sabic , makrolon by bayer and so on.	8.288876870731686
So , you increase the temperature again and when you increase the temperature , again the time goes up; again the molecular weight builds up.	9.820536089084529
You will add on to that about 10 % open added space or for various purposes.	9.753252373369934
The first one is tau which is the reactor space time in terms of v / q.	11.529877890034102
It is same , it is same as the initiator concentration because as we discussed , that each initiator actually initiates one chain , so the concentration of the anions would be same as the concentration of the initiator molecules.	9.49383648439493
In practice what we do is if we operate a reactor we are making feed from the bottom at some concentration s.	10.65254250990303
Whereas this n - butyl is minus 2; isobutyl is 29; tertiary butyl is 64 degree centigrade.	8.093727506031843
We begin our discussion with a general feature of chain polymerization , how chain polymerization compares with step polymerization.	9.2180711762084
As far as their industrial application is concerned the issue is restricted to mainly three issues : one is that the coenzyme and the enzyme must be retained in the reactor.	8.327892108218078
This example probably was the first commercial process used anywhere in the world using immobilized enzymes.	9.779652087644264
So , don t confuse that , for applying this equations , you must take the temperature in kelvin.	9.986796950786553
For example , poly ethylene oxide and poly proplyne oxide they are synthesized by anionic opening corresponding cyclic monomer of ethylene oxide , and propylene oxides.	9.342292216729966
So , they will have elution volume of v 0 and if polymer size becomes lower and lower , and becomes such a low that all of them can penetrate equally in the pores then all will come at the same time , and this become v 0 plus v i.	9.010080183196237
The pfr is a desirable type of reactor where the effect of drop in the reactor performance as the result of enzyme deactivation will be much slower for substrate dependent thermal deactivation.	12.216255541122063
So , that when the molecular weight becomes infinity , x n becomes infinity , that means , basically , you have the entire molecular polymers unfrosting to each other.	9.730259962099433
What i am trying to explain is that the chances of finding one vacant cell near the polymer chain would be lower than if you go little distance from a polymer chain because of segments are attached.	10.11894671413606
They only say that after all these interactions have taken place some of the reaction mechanism responsible for catalytic function will take place and the reaction is catalyzed.	12.24100301360222
So , because of scattering and absorption , there will be loss of intensity.	7.4099632022590765
Second thing is the enzyme catalyzed reaction in the presence of a competitive inhibitor results in an increased km value and the vm value is totally not affected.	9.68706392979255
And this means that c and d are two equilibrium , equilibrium composition and we name this as binodal , binodal compositions or binodal points.	9.427207410253432
And if you increase the temperature typically , if the free volume increases , the polymer becomes lesser than or the materials becomes less dense.	10.227121926748776
You have to place the repeat unit such a way that the seniority the one , the part which is senior most gets the , you put in the extreme left hand side.	8.706788960696755
One of the most important features of these kinetics which i like to reiterate are the assumptions that are involved in arriving at these rate expressions and i would like you to clearly consider them while applying this kinetics to any experimental situation.	8.645128021275234
In enzymatic reactions usually there will be oxidoreductases , redox reactions if they consume oxygen or give out oxygen a difference in the dissolved oxygen can be used to measure the substrate.	10.553504856441151
Polymerization happening inside the miceller core , monomer concentration get depleted , so the monomers inside the micelle , this monomer droplets will become smaller by supplying micelle , supplying monomer to the miceller core via , this aqueous medium.	10.179243599286929
When i say catalytic efficiency , i normally mean the magnitude by which it is able to increase the rate of reaction compared to an uncatalyzed reaction or the turn over number of the enzyme that means number of moles of substrate converted to product per unit time per mole of the catalyst.	8.651811350626593
The activated carrier is then stirred with the buffered enzyme solution followed by washing of the unbound enzyme.	10.219847992879936
Y - axis is the activity factor , ln e / eo in the logarithmic scale you must get a first order decay as shown in the first case.	10.169519947992889
Today we shall discuss about the effect of immobilization on functional properties of the enzyme molecules.	9.191812573953927
Now , this is between c and d you can clearly see that c and d are the binodal points where is 0 between c c and e d and f the slope is changing in positive way so d pie 2 is greater than .	9.775501108664345
Jd factor is defined as a lumped parameter which takes into an account the mass transfer coefficient particularly field diffusion coefficient as well as the reactor operational parameters.	10.731571924466785
These two parameters can be looked at from these expressions.	8.909693748752632
In fact even batch reactors are used in commercial preparations extensively mainly because of their simplicity and ease of fabrication and operational convenience for many reactions.	9.718294582636018
So , in the chain reaction , you have the long polymer chain at the beginning itself.	8.526562758893979
And as the reactions are happening or the monomers is getting added at the end of the chain , high molecular weight even possible at low conversion.	9.388925941845812
But if in a reaction mechanism some of the steps or some of the inter conversions are irreversible in nature then many of the patterns will disappear because there will be no chance of synthesizing that particular species.	11.4107794086085
No single reaction cannot , no single reaction can have negative activation energy.	9.787016599873233
Now , as i said before that for engineer , it is not always very easy to build a reactor where you know you can take out the condensate molecules to the level , where you want for the building of molecular weight.	8.832468530607654
If these blends are miscible sorry this co polymers the two blocks are miscible , then obviously you are going to get single phase , and which will give as a single t g.	9.153516597701318
For living cells usually adsorption has been a method which had been very commonly used while for non - viable cells , entrapment is the method which has been most widely used.	10.9457268978031
So , the polymer which are same type used and calibration.	7.713317907041515
So , let us compare between the two polymerization processes one more time in the chain and step polymers.	8.22060659870962
The combination of the two studies particularly the effect of substrate concentration and studying the nature of inhibition with respect to one or more of the products will give you the nature of inhibition pattern and that information can give you a conclusion about the nature of the reaction mechanism.	10.400255008145955
Now as i just mentioned that this light scattering technique can happen for any electromagnetic radiations like visible light or x - ray or neutrons.	9.868184960177972
Basically what you are doing when you increase the enzyme loading is you are changing the thiele modulus.	9.65682620811354
The methane mono oxygenase enzyme oxidize methane in to ethanol spontaneously in the living cells particularly those organisms which can survive or consume methane as a carbon source.	10.137651248339537
So , you can take those m w s and use here and do the calibration curve.	7.599612308879567
Most of the hydrolytic enzymes are regulated by the mechanisms commonly known as induction or repression or catabolic repression.	9.57475066402478
That means , this solvents are very poor solvents if you want to build higher molecular weight in the radical polymerization.	7.70196919924153
Whereas in second order transition; in case of second order transition both of these are continuous functions , but the second derivative of the gibbs free energy function g is varies with these parameters discontinuously.	9.392426648796171
Now intrinsic viscosity; if you compare this two expressions then we can write this m v is.	10.810808012399951
The fatty acid or whatever lipid molecule you have used for making the micelle , they are arranged such that the hydrophobic heads are diverted inside which form a structure and tails are extruding outside and then you disperse it through the use of surfactant and you have an interface here consisting mainly of the hydrophobic tails which remains very stable in the organic medium.	10.895447475855702
So , the efficiency actually comes down , came down during the reaction.	6.554330951048632
Therefore non - porous matrices usually have a limitation of low surface area.	10.860588017101156
Another very common inhibitor which we come across at always is oxygen.	10.333680967238237
So , in this case , we call this as short branched chain.	4.923665476016122
Nonetheless one semi empirical method proposed by price and alphre is often used very commonly to sort of get the reactivity ratios of different monomers , and a ranking between different monomers in terms of their reactivities.	11.734610871505904
We just go to the next set of the properties , where is basically expo.	11.133898336476479
And , it depends upon the final applications; if your applications required a flame , a polymer which is flame resistant , then you must add a flame retardant to it.	9.643332707827229
How nucleic acids take part in information transformation from one cell to next generation , what are the mechanism of cell - cell signaling , communication between different cells or how does the protein molecules behave as a defense molecules.	10.777353001917076
You need a very specific enzyme and that brings in some sort of disadvantage as far as their role as industrial catalyst is concerned.	9.588618141927983
So , primary anti oxidant , basically trap this r dot and peroxy radicals.	9.336365588077491
We must also look at the possible kind of interactions that are likely to take place and almost all the interactions between enzyme and substrate for bi - substrate reactions have been classified into some general forms.	9.25648293322094
In case of thermosets , you do not need that compromise , because thermosets are generally starts with low molecular weight polymers , and you make the final product or you process that low molecular weight , and then subsequently you cross link that , to increase cross link or cure in other term , and increase the molecular weight , so you do not have to compromise anything.	10.785529651318171
While a packed bed system cannot be used in the soluble enzyme but a hollow fiber reactor can be used in soluble enzyme and particularly where contacting an enzyme and the substrate is a problem such reactors have been used and in terms of flow behavior , because of these hollow fibers being of the capillary size , very fine capillaries and a bundle is made so they almost provide a reactor performance in line with the plug flow barrier no.	10.792065696672395
Degree of purification required is also larger because you will not like any protein contaminant present in the sample and their cost is therefore significantly high of the order of about 106 us dollars per kg.	10.734149530984325
When we mentioned our assumptions of michaelis menten equation , you will notice that these assumptions will largely not fit into most of the actual enzyme catalyzed reactions.	9.078804095125772
The enzyme particles which are hydrophilic contain the water molecules around the enzyme and they are suspended in the bulk organic medium.	10.618725786717185
Now , let us consider that n 0 is the number of molecules at t is equal to .	5.232212979219802
In this case the formation happens by addition of monomers towards the chain end.	7.605671781440089
The significance of co - operative binding lies in actual practice in the case of allosteric enzymes.	8.400723891456154
If there are more substituent s , both the carbonate terms in the example , we said just showed in the last pages , where you have ch 2 c h y , instead of one substitute , if you have substitution in the both the carbon , then it becomes more difficult.	10.768555810748756
Now , this size , the size of this radicals or size of this oligomeric propagating radical is much smaller , very oligomeric in nature , so whether they terminate by this propagation or they terminate by a combination , the size of the final dead chain is same as a size of this kinetic chain length.	10.05106749586334
This expression is valid.	8.730292625617105
Now , mechanical probabilities is polymers , mechanical prosperities is related to deformation , what happened in when you apply some force or a stress to polymeric material or plastic material , it it deforms.	11.014165666780242
They are exactly fitting.	9.9934835910734
Anionic polymerizations , as i said that it is much more solvent dependent compared to cationic , cationic chain polymerization.	9.254583437925934
Whereas , if , is take a undried pet , which have significant amount of moisture in the sample , then it actually hydrolysis very soon in that high temperature and high shear condition , during processing as a freezen molecular weight drops , and viscosity of the sample also drops.	10.729114457087839
So , brittle that if this copolymer does not have a significant improvement over , over the polystyrene molecule homo polymer in terms of brittleness.	11.046098535412026
So , from the single data of m n and the structure , you know all others p is close to .	7.663297539073137
Stabilization of transition state means that the enzyme because of its confirmation which is complimentary to the transition state , binds and stabilizes the transition state complex.	10.688245641664244
But in general with increase in fractional conversion the productivity will go down in both the cases because in the reactor performance equation the decrease in tau will be much faster compared to increase in fractional conversion.	9.072511061257522
In the last lecture we have covered the cyclization verses linear polymerization , what are the conditions which prefer linear polymerization , which are different the preferred ones.	9.3773941527115
So this can , this counter ion help in strong coordination between the active chain end and the polar substituent of the another monomer residues present in the chain.	8.421775239251755
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
So , typically this technique is applied; the lower limit is around the order of 10 to the power 4 to 10 to the power 5; this is the lower limit and the upper limit is given by this lambda by .	8.718780147344209
This has very important feature.	10.013587743952614
You can dissolve the monomer in a solvent and do the polymerization then it is named as solution polymerization.	10.329044672455069
So , what does del h and del s 0 means.	7.013737403112974
They are macromolecules of different amino acids in a sense they are hetero macromolecules , hetero polymers; that means the monomer units are not identical in nature.	9.669053384776078
Now , let us let us go back and look at the mechanism of the emulsion polymerization , now what are the constitutes , now say at the beginning what are the constitutions we have , we have monomers which is water insoluble or slightly soluble , very slightly soluble in water.	9.148657399670762
But in the case of large reactors there are lot of deviations from the plug flow behavior which we will consider.	10.279283287548065
In last lecture we introduced different types of chain reactions possible and we also convince our self that if there is a chain transfer reaction , expect if the chain transfer is by the reaction with a polymer chain dead polymer chain.	10.48648890242512
Now , i do not expect student to remember a question , how many ways a polymer can be classified , but students should be aware of the terminology , which are used in this various classifications , so that when they come across these terms , they should be able to relate the meaning of this term.	9.833914887914377
So , i would be i minus .	6.723595567523903
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
That means the enzyme transfers again the action of atp to adp.	8.34933741874197
But there is a potential that it can be produced provided the applications emerge so that the scale of operations which is required for bulk operation can be easily maintained and so the reversible interaction between availability and application is a very intrinsic feature and probably will illustrate the story of many of the enzymes which have become commercially viable today.	10.973938397015742
These are the yellow ones of the branched of this linear polymer; imagine this two have same molecular weight.	7.060409082731326
That will be only restricted when you are talking of a fibre or a surface.	10.154426047096248
There have been some academic efforts to take advantage of anti bodies to provide a catalytic function , to take advantage of stabilizing effect because antibodies have very high values of affinity to their substrate.	9.410225993184739
Now when you mix this two , as it was mixed by ziegler what happens , this forms beta form of titanium chloride which is brown in color.	10.238509464353246
Or in other words in place of turn over number k2 that appear in the case of michaelis menten kinetics you put the rate limiting rate constant in this sequence of interaction in the enzyme substrate or in the enzyme kinetics and that will still be valid.	10.102284398127336
The expression will represent a straight line with a slope of km / vm and intercept on the y - axis as 1 / vm and intercept on x axis as - 1 / km.	7.770675669314275
V = 0 this gives you a generalized second order differential equation which can be set for internal pore diffusion cum biochemical reaction.	10.864396621643879
And in case of step polymers you get the high molecular weight only at very high conversion.	8.705262107912853
Most of these cases are usually related to bisubstrate reactions particularly because you notice here that the inhibitor binds after the substrate is bound.	10.682282435064707
Enthalpy of mixing del h m is positive or 0, if delta 1 is equals to delta 2 the drawback of these approach is that it cannot predict any negative enthalpy of mixing , which sometimes happen if there are strong specific interaction between the polymer and the solvent.	9.814994302499358
So , in this lecture , what we will do , we will get the expression for enthalpy of mixing.	6.142997850212733
So , the impact behavior of glass is basically poor so , the glass impact behavior and modulus does not always match with each other.	8.781674031242796
The relationship between pore diffusional limitations and the thiele modulus is explained in terms of effectiveness factor because if you know effectiveness factor you can have reactor performance equation , where you multiply reactor rate expression which is.	12.656345214411187
Now let us , that is not practical , you know , the chain without a restriction , bond angle restriction or bond rotational restriction without is physically unrealistic.	10.749130981992689
You see here in the bulk phase , the part b shows that in the carrier particle the diffusional limitations are not very high.	9.63547662444528
So , we need to have very good mechanism , so that the , the can be exposed to the vacuum you are applying , so that you can push the reaction towards the product side.	8.528296395140824
Substituting the value of es from equilibrium analysis you can come down to a initial reaction rate vo = k2 [ e - s ] if you look at the original mechanistic hypothesis proposed by michaelis and menten , you can write k2 p + e.	9.921252868642357
So , what we basically need what we basically no that simple cyclic rings like cyclo pentain or cyclo butane they do not undergo reopening polymerization.	8.578684081798908
So , what is the effect of temperature on r p and x n is we are going to discuss now.	6.174176204006145
Now , remember this is a gaseous reaction to polyethylene is a gas to solid form , solid polymers.	9.513690183589757
So , the higher is this ratio higher is the poly in dispersive index that means higher is the breadth.	9.02541049272507
We can have polyamides from the diol plus diacid.	10.888811466354587
Different methods have been used; so crosslinking becomes an important parameter to provide stability to the immobilized preparation.	9.277301755316257
Now if for a dilute solution , the plot of eta s p versus c is linear only till your eta r is less than equals to .	10.197678827915084
This is only a cross section of the system.	5.504936968447358
So , basically , absorption of uv light is basically determinant for the polymer molecules.	6.108245451590818
I like to illustrate only one example which has become quite interesting say for example in the case of patients who suffer from partial kidney failure.	9.785229598291851
The third kind of material is gel structure.	8.825756091864235
Now , polymerization , chain polymerization are in general consist of three steps; three main step , initiation , propagation , and termination.	8.634640201362314
Let us move on and try out; some other points which we must just to add some more points in this membrane osmometry that the membranes are different for different solvent.	9.234944303411671
Tensile strains for bulk bulk polymers are less than about 100 mpa whereas , metals and ions , they are quiet high.	12.399638379077436
So , determination of or evaluation of reactivity ratios , so i write just like r.	9.569694075822026
Based on that assumption then he gave a rate expression which is v / vm = sn / k + sn this is called hills equation.	8.099905905168432
V is based on surface area unlike in the case of soluble enzyme where we usually represent based on the volumetric reaction velocity and that s why we have multiplied by 2pr.	10.446119040006153
So , then spectra nmr spectra , then we are talking about that many number of that many number of equivalent groups of protons present in the molecules; the chemical shift of the delta h value will give the idea , what type of idea , what type of chemical environment , so what type of group.	9.468817040979632
And then basically the value of t g becomes independent of molecular weight.	7.505186709374419
Then , monomer reactivity , how it depends on the different modes of chain initiation and then talk about effect of structure on reactivities , mainly in radical copolymerization.	9.054403664909794
So , basically the higher the solubility , it is higher is the permeability of the polymer matrix towards that gas.	10.794872995733185
Similarly you can design another equipment where you have a polymer solutions in this capillary and which is separated by a semipermeable membrane which is only permeable to the solvent molecules.	9.646294490580956
So obviously their cost per unit quantity is comparably very high and coupled with their stability it becomes an expensive proposition.	10.775673252692382
Now we can apply clausius - clapeyron equation and write del p del t is del h vaporization by t v m; v m is molar volume and if you consider the vapor is the ideal gas , considering the ideal gas vapor we can do few mathematical steps to write.	10.254151515196526
These are the various parameters like the enzyme itself , the reaction , product , equipment , running cost and advantage of scale and one has to analyze a given process on the basis of these parameters and then take a decision whether it is desirable to go for a soluble enzyme batch system , immobilized enzyme batch system or immobilized enzyme continuous system.	10.497807570511034
As you know from your physical chemistry knowledge that any non - ideality which happens in case of solutions for small molecules are due to non - athermal mixing or delta h mixing is not equal to .	8.893272499031493
They very they produced in small volumes , and we are not going to discuss much about conducting polymers.	11.353585719140804
So , toluene has high r value rayleigh ratio and pure form easily available.	9.276551978985097
Other design parameters are fractional conversion and productivity and reactor capacity.	11.543327043353358
So , in a polymerization what is the relative facts proportion of this all the possible structure we just discussed 1, 3 addition , 3, 4 addition and 1, 4 addition; obviously , between 1, 2, 3, 4 and 1, 4 addition; between these three obviously it will be the addition which will give the intermediate having lowest energy.	10.527125294274738
So , conversion is number of molecules reacted , number of function group reacted and the number of functional group originally present , so that is a fraction , that is a conversion , which gives you 2 by f average minus twice n by n 0 f average or twice f average minus twice x n f average because n 0 by n is your x n.	9.856605702111572
The same thing you can do if you what to keep this in the organic medium you can add a phase transfer catalyst in the water side , which will then complex with this bisphenol a salt and bring it closer to the organic medium.	9.023401730438884
If there is a endothermic processes , there will be delta t will be lower correspondence to the difference , because you were supplying constant amount of energy to the system.	9.243019209274097
In many cases the binding of substrate can influence the catalytic function on the substrate binding.	7.972690372185549
Therefore the tau increases with increase in fractional conversion more pronouncedly in the case of cstr , the reverse may happen in the case of productivity.	9.03399322460064
If there is no substrate or product then the rate constant will be as it is.	9.638362147003198
Besides the equilibrium conversion or equilibrium constant of the reaction , the catalysis or the enzyme catalysis also follows all thermodynamic concepts that are applied to chemical reactions.	9.288783771383688
So , pore size might vary from very low to moderately high and they are packed with having beads of diameter of 5 micron to 10 micron.	10.106105863658447
We can break down the reaction and the classical arrhenius equation , the expression for rate constant can be written as k = rt / nh exp (.	9.448577567580479
That means an enzyme can bind to substrate forming enzyme substrate complex.	7.535168977316323
That means the reaction will take place under conditions of s , p or x which exist at the exit stream.	7.803287385041364
In the case of a fluidized bed reactor the voidage is very high.	5.3122243826426185
I just showed one example in this page.	7.406881832424268
We just seen that it is a ether , then it can be polymerized by cationic , it can be difficultly polymerized by radical also , but most preferred choice of polymerizing a ether group , hanging from a double bond is to use cationic polymerization.	9.80235496556818
In such a case you will ultimately end up with the kinetic equation or kinetic expression which will express the sigmoidal reaction velocity profile response.	9.144646618763971
So , actually the main contribution for chain transformations chain transfer reaction is , the solvent so whether this might be significant for some particular cases , for this is very important for majority of the radical chain polymerization reactions.	9.792135165617443
If i want to know the ability to scatter a light from that sample , it would , you know , we need m w value , rather than m n.	9.447940985735348
They are very low refracting index which makes them exceptional having optical clarity because no aromatic group containing , so they have good weatheribility.	10.427515607410884
That means the kappm will be dependent on the thickness of the film.	6.367524580586228
The third component there is significant reduction in the labor cost.	9.069364119067151
That is for a particular enzyme catalyzed reaction how to identify the reaction mechanism it follows.	13.367538987272761
What we will do; we will just come back in the next lecture and by now we understood that by flory huggins approach we can find out the entropy of mixing for a polymer and a solvent.	8.046906097329856
You know we have talked about different types of copolymers.	6.4875143950749505
Now , let us compare some numbers.	5.792432269122033
So , acrylo acrylonitrile would give you poly acrylonitrile and so on.	6.979849110002539
So , basically , if you have a specimen , you try to bend them and if you resist , you feel resistance to bending you call this , the material is stiff.	9.589792972550482
Now , we have this equation.	5.678026017350209
The molecules have to reach to this state of the energy so that the transition state can form and then it can be broken down to form the enzyme and the product.	10.381391559773656
All these are constants.	9.517941017108717
If they are alternate one after one , then if you call syndiotactic and if there is no order , it is placed random and then , we call as atactic.	10.614442650059217
So , we will talk about kinetic.	5.740215169946671
So far we have discussed various facets of enzymes starting from the chemical and functional nature of the enzymes , reaction kinetics , methods of immobilization of enzymes followed by the design and analysis of immobilized enzyme reactors merely from the point of view of their application in process industries and today we will take some examples of these applications particularly in process industries.	9.081218507318992
So , in this case , the molecular weight remain unchanged; it becomes the dead polymers , as same as the size of the reacting polymer.	6.997897778323994
And between e and f this is the change of slope , sorry this is slope and this is the rate of change of slope this change of is coming in positive direction here , and negative direction here.	11.227477256754652
Third is es is small which means low enzyme loading in the matrix.	9.77639965839809
Today we will be looking at these environmental parameters and how they influence the whole enzyme catalyzed reactions.	7.992850471273815
You should know the relationship between x n bar the number average degree of polymerization with r the stoichiometry ratio and p the conversion in a normal step polymerization process.	10.160845230639884
It is because it is linked to another carbonate which is not in the basic chain.	10.593917291449257
You know they do not change too much with reaction conditions like temperature and reaction medium , but if we have different chain initiation mode.	10.90460369827533
These are the timer dimer which is present in maximum number.	7.528885379318519
If there are gel effect then what happen you know that branching might happened and if branching happen between or the which results from chain transfer two polymer.	9.251990114690706
So , then the reaction of this two reacting species will be happening in the organic side of the interface.	10.132279057329523
And that is the reason this is very difficult and and that is why this reactions are very difficult to carry out.	9.498511253045299
But , this reactions we know this direct esterification of alcohol and acids or say ester an acid groups are very slow reactions.	9.52857833030824
But the data beyond sixteen hours have not been shown here but within a couple of hours definitely not more than twenty four hours it is able to say and the reactor performance drops down.	10.10408677310432
Cstr is much more desirable.	17.6603669054982
Now , you can deliberately , in most cases laboratory , we do terminate a propagating anion by adding some external reagent.	9.657608242856893
So , this is a case we are talking about reversible termination.	6.57892777708404
It could be in any shape.	8.897105406241357
You can make a polymer of different shape and later on , if you melt it again by heating and again , you can reshape it , give it reshape , ok.	10.86877688114431
So , we know this.	5.02481317926465
Unlike a step growth polymerization , where we require a high conversion to a high molecular rate , in this case , we do not require a high conversions to build a high molecular rate.	9.129123096746206
So , mainly it is the polymer.	7.337110669085489
So , you have to understand that there are already i number of polymers present which means i into x number of cells are already occupied.	7.894152480505604
They could be on the same site where the substrate binds or even they could be on a site in proximity of that or in such a way that the binding of the substrate is influenced.	8.860528296040073
This is a very few of trade names covered in this slide.	9.40238513600925
You talk about amide , you have this.	11.062304515497313
Next step of additives are basically use to make the polymer surface useful for biological applications , there are lots some applications , where polymers or parts of parts made of polymeric polymeric polymers are used in biological application.	10.788682790255512
Although there is a very , very mild concentration gradient , the substrate is present all through the carrier particle.	11.063066553354332
That means it ranges from first order to zero order regime.	6.9342683680938695
So , what we now know that it is almost difficult to take out entirely the small condensate.	9.024110683318094
If you consider such a reaction you will notice that the concentration of hydrogen ions at any given ph can be regulated by the ph of the environment.	7.998665396238032
If the side reaction rate also increases , then again the problem of molecular build up come.	10.342075862818405
So we just , one more time let us discuss.	10.53327653439846
And this we talking about a amorphous material and at the highly temperature is , it behaves like a polymer liquid.	10.820833871254237
This addition of water molecule results into an unstable transition state compound , which has partial bonds , partial negative and positive charges at the molecule.	9.780215180226953
It is a non - assymetric product.	8.509055872174775
If the total enzyme is present in the form of eh that is vmtrue.	8.062904693219503
So , i have , what i have , i have the dove made of wheat flour , and i just made this dove from wheat flower , i just put some water to make it soft.	9.712695837314
Mold release basically , the a polymeric surface - active agent , which have long hydrophobic tail and because of , presence of this high surface low surface energy long hydrophobic tail , they migrate to the surface.	10.114559292514368
And we will also discuss little bit about other thermal responses in other , other responses polymer shows when you heat up a polymer material.	8.97285413627606
For 0.2m , it deactivates much faster and you see that in twenty days time only 25 % of the enzyme is left , 75 % has got deactivated and here in the same period almost 50 % of the enzyme is present at a higher substrate concentration.	11.277551173121607
Which means , what i am telling that , this is the original state now , if i already have stretched and aligned oriented little bit then obviously , aligning from or stretching reforming from this state will be much easier compared to aligning from or deforming longitudinally form this state.	11.25211039702979
Unless , if you do not use the additives in those resins which are coming out of the reactor , they are , will come down drastically.	12.162328942991305
At the time of fischers lock and key mechanism , the most understood enzymatic reaction was hydrolysis of sucrose by invertase to glucose and fructose and obviously they would look into variety of other sugars like lactose on which the enzyme could not act.	9.719976728172485
Example could be bf 3, alcl 3, sncl 4, slcl 5, zncl 2, ticl 4, and so on , or they are derivatives , like racl 2, r 2 alcl and so on.	9.337147204209495
That means the protein molecule itself is not catalytically functional but in the presence of the cofactor the molecule may become a catalyst and may be considered as an enzyme.	8.996609233368638
See by emulsion method , you make core , you make take a butadiene , and polymerize in by emulsion method to make a butadiene code , and some of the double bound which has remain unreacted.	11.520475496301136
But you cannot recover that.	9.644730479851457
Whereas if the toxic generates immediately after burning , then what happened , they cannot , they actually get ill immediately , and they cannot run away and find a safer place.	10.105992777629908
So , remember , we talked about in step polymerization that the reactivity of the functional group present at the end of the oligomeric chain or a polymeric chain , does not depends on what is present in the other side , whether the other group is reacted , or what is the length the oligomer.	8.486488445876766
One of the major advantages is that you always end up having a distance between the carrier surface and the enzyme molecules.	7.367921563918669
Basically if you take this example , propylene by titanium catalyst; now , this can get transferred and you can have the chain get terminated.	11.467560974127924
Now , if these two monomers are present like this where it is sort of combination of two small blocks of a and b , so it is like oligomer of a or polymer of a which is linked with oligomer or polymer of b.	9.473693030591702
The dotted line here indicates the process.	9.051569037489761
See aa bb type structure , this can cyclize to give like this.	9.748568263585371
If this is positive then rate of polymerization will go up with temperature and if its negative if it is negative then it will go down.	9.24356376274546
This is the monomer which i have written here at the end now.	9.64736975367498
Very often we must realize that the causes of deviation from the ideality are because of certain stagnant reasons in the case of reactor.	8.720137660233858
So , if at least with this type nmr s analysis , we can clearly say that whether a copolymer is a random copolymer or a block type copolymer.	9.421114301111258
Therefore the substrate concentration at which the reaction will take place actually in the particle boundaries will be less than that in the bulk or at the surface and therefore the effectiveness factor will be less then or equal to one.	8.395256221508456
And , once the chain length is reduced , molecular rate goes down , and the properties of the polymer also go down.	10.07567692247627
If not we again go back to the mechanistic hypothesis modify it , revise it , in the light of the deviations and then again go back to a new rate equation and therefore such an analytical sequence continues till we are able to match our rate expression with the experimentally observed data.	9.916655944110918
X z minus .	16.137952050952197
So , it is preferable that the column is kept in a constant temperature; obviously , the sample loading is small from a very dilute solution; specially , when you are using detectors like light scattering and viscosity there we are assumption the solution is very dilute.	10.243451745522187
Now , this example i am giving for polycarbonate , but this is , this analysis is applicable for any polymer , any copolymer specially for poly condensation copolymers; where you have , you can find out a carbon which are signal , anymore signal dependent on the two two groups which is holding that bond.	9.444563448066303
At the beginning , n 0 is number of molecules.	9.341649185093667
So , in some cases , you might get m 2 getting in and then again may be one more at m .	8.874635785122654
So these are the issues that provide us a very important understanding towards the role of effector molecules.	9.647518095603592
Now , if i compare between cyclization tendency verses linear polymerization tendency , now this depends upon both kinetic factor as well as thermodynamic factor.	9.37891789038508
Under this first order design or under condition of s0 &lt; &lt; km there is another feature which we must look at.	10.992991599786839
So , now we know that by experimentally we can know the rates the individual rates we know r i , we know r p , we know r t and we also know k d , k p , k t we know all this from experiments.	9.71345714390491
For example , liquid additives are normally difficult to handle.	8.434085294651192
If you start the feed inlet concentration say at hundred times the km value and the final substrate concentration from the effluent is let us say fifty km.	10.126887773743087
On the other hand in the case of sigmoidal kinetics this ratio is only 2..	7.874936259545802
Obviously polycarbonate will not be soluble in methanol water or some of the non polar solvents , cyclohexene and sides carbon tetrachloride zylene and so on.	9.760353278373996
Ki = e . i / ei km = e . s / es you can write the rate expression for such a binding mechanism and the rate expression will come out to be s s v0 / vm = = km ( 1 + i / ki ) + s k m + s now if you compare it to michaelis menten equation which is s / k m + s.	8.752909601522596
Now , if you compare the other cases like r 1 and r 2 is .	5.065655976156939
So , how do get this combinatorial entropy or gibbs free energy for mixing for the polymer solution.	8.950683957488065
Also the effectiveness problem can be more serious when substrates of low diffusivities are to be processed.	11.648727284455186
If you run out of the option of increasing temperature then people try to increase the pressure to increase the rate of polymerization.	8.781748396055338
You start with small molecules monomers as a low viscous to liquid and then , put it in a container and then , cure it by heating or doing some chemical reaction by that doing this reaction are by heating.	10.844762909199744
Now , the term azeotropic mole fraction is coming because we know azeotrops were mole fraction of 2 liquids in vapor phase equals to the mole fraction of the 2 liquids in liquid phase.	9.634701003311772
This was one of the earliest analyses for the experimental data in the light of michaelis menten hypothesis.	9.78350601689536
Only dependent upon the molecular structure , but also in the crystallity and crystal morphology.	11.947176681214208
If the volume is lower in transition state then del v will be negative.	8.478086772896463
So , basically all have a hetero atom in the ring , whether it is a or ester or amides whatever is the case.	7.8249049539996465
A special case of ordered ternary complex formation is thorell and chance mechanism because in many of the enzyme catalyzed reactions , thorell and chance observed that ternary complex is not a very stable entity and it exists only for a short period of time.	7.689413651304909
We can consider the dissociation constant of es as km.	8.372309304870466
So the magnitude of km , the magnitude of michaelis menten constant , also gives you a parameter for assay of the enzyme so that you can choose your substrate concentration for carrying out the experiments.	10.741049158848426
All these studies are based on initial reaction rate but if you look at the practical application that will be based on total productivity and both the effects the deactivation as well as increase of reaction rate with temperature should be considered.	10.78756542374573
And the chain growth occurs in titanium alkyl bond.	9.479299578845682
Now for branched polymer , obviously , even if even you consider theta condition and put a branched polymer , then the expansion factor will be lower than the one if you compare with a linear polymer.	10.074277632262207
And it will decide because it is always negative and it is always contribute in favor of mixing.	11.041420861989934
And depending upon the amount of scatter , the transparency will come down , and higher the scattering , the transparency will be low less.	10.785282485862854
You must have studied also in the case of bio separations particularly the concentration of salt is used for increasing as well as decreasing solubility.	12.930921252156262
Now , let us talk about one of the common example of polymer degradation and the stabilization; and let us take example of polyvinyl chloride degradation.	8.018807019872618
So , again just for one more time that the initiation rate constant his much lower compare to a propagation chain propagation which is much faster reaction very termaist much faster even faster reaction.	9.42820731249361
You can have the other ingredients along with the polymer like a stabilizer fillers or pigments , but it is the polymers which is the major ingredient and other additives acts as a support which either enable the polymer to have you know better performance.	10.52591571679208
That is because this has same effect as excess bb.	8.617198187428087
So , at very beginning itself , you get a high polymer , very high molecular weight polymer in the system and more and more active species get generated , more and more monomers reacts.	9.299829832367676
Until 2000, more than ninety five percent of the ziegler - natta polymerization used combination of this sort of catalyst before the discovery of the metallization catalyst.	11.141927395441416
In the c part the reverse is there.	8.327233855468391
So , if i consider one example.	5.198992782990398
You can also carry out isomerization by enzymatic route using the glucose isomerase.	9.089354221302
Start with different f 1 values.	12.058868003645
Whether we are looking for high fractional conversion and that is the demand of the system or high productivity depending on the nature of the product stream.	10.424596914884825
But in most of the cases , this ceiling temperature is quite high compared to our reaction temperature.	8.754446269264122
The third parameter is one must ensure the substrate concentration for assay of the enzyme.	8.580454502684033
That means a - 1, 4 - glucoside linkage.	8.075900341664385
Then you have a set of environmental parameters like hydrogen ion concentration reflected in ph , or the temperature of reaction.	9.67009966518752
Pure monomer is getting converted to a pure polymer which is completely amorphous or slightly crystalline.	11.61144215585118
We are familiar with many of the diseases which are seen when one of the enzymes stops functioning.	13.5234549496262
I like you to be very critical about the scientific , technological and engineering aspects.	8.526648460567786
It can be a random input in any fashion; you allow some quantity of tracer to be inserted randomly and notice the output which will also be random depending on the flow profile.	10.084267545261026
Let us take an example.	4.813064321504609
And it is not dependent on the reaction initiation system you are following.	11.152909122651701
So , how many of number of groups , number of molecules present now.	7.7389281072457194
Now , if you talk about , if the , all the radicals which are produced , do they , do they all react , or do they initiate a polymerization.	8.135532893796949
So , what is , again , continue in a random way.	7.260012905890022
In the molecule the carboxylic group and the methyl group are bound onto the enzyme active site.	8.072271479415388
The fourth is the diffusional limitations.	7.7347674502885795
Xylose is the inducer.	17.131348432477917
And also , we gave example of other type of initiation reactions where there could be inherent termination reaction.	8.93782998754703
So , the confirmation the confirmation of a flexible chain looks like random flights of division of particles , when particle say , gas particle diffuse then what happens.	8.58983730381208
Another example , we can show , the other , the other example where.	13.230612196496635
Now , if you increase the temperature of polymer , polymers typically degrade.	6.8973327360921735
If you have a capillary , then there will be rise in the height of the capillary and this will continue till this additional pressure compensate or increases the chemical potential volume of the solvent this side equals to such a extent that it becomes equals to the chemical potential of the solvent in this side.	8.865174853055976
Therefore this acts as a very potent sulpha drug.	11.538400591034724
Then only it will represent the actual sample what in your hand or what you are handling with.	10.470410118955085
The inhibitor can bind to only to the es complex and does not bind to the free enzyme.	9.314016999674546
Now , if i go and look this m n m n dot chain one propagating radical , they can react with a monomer , which is k p and it can react with x x a it could be solvent in others , which is basically the transfer.	10.454315977778725
Even in chemical engineering that is very conventional thing; only difference is that those catalysts are very , very stable interms of their thermal , operational as well as storage stability where as immobilized enzymes are not as stable.	10.884553669272723
The essential characteristic of a catalyst is to accelerate the rate of reaction that it is supposed to catalyze , but in the process it is not used up in itself and in an ideal situation it must be possible to recover the catalyst at the end of the reaction.	9.872236815570632
But because you have dispersion present in the medium , this polymer polymers will remain , they will the dispersion will get absorbed on the surface of this polymer , and the polymers should remain as dispersion in the polymerization medium.	10.067284380172588
If suppose the carrier is negatively charged , there will be higher concentration of the hydrogen ions compared to the bulk and vice versa and therefore in the case of a negatively charged carrier , the apparent shift in ph will be on the alkaline side.	9.801057122468324
It acts as a competitive inhibitor for folic acid biosynthesis from para amino benzoic acid.	8.29152196174147
So , as you know from our knowledge if carbon has four different substitution then this is a stereo center or stereogenic center; sometimes we also call this is an asymmertric center and it is a chiral also.	10.263150860025624
So the only way out left to a scientist is that one isolates and tries to mimic the conditions of a cell so that one can probably try to interpret the functioning in a cell; how it is happening and the immobilization provided isolation of the enzyme.	9.357941535646132
A typical example of the ordered ternary complex formation as i mentioned is liver alcohol dehydrogenase which is obtained in the mammalian systems and also lactate dehydrogenase is another example of ordered ternary complex formation.	8.386048288570668
In case of photochemical reaction it actually gets slight increase in molecular weight with increase in temperature.	7.620223710279124
So , now what happens , what happen to k c , rate constant for cyclization.	9.19664379159715
Now , also polymers if you with it is presented in a solution most and most commonly in the organic solvent.	8.115287708495217
So , there will be an interaction between this positive counter ion and the negative propagating chain end and the new incoming monomer.	6.90719587054447
Similarly if the substrate is also positively charged you are going to have higher substrate concentration in the carrier or at the site of enzyme rather than the bulk or it could be the other way.	9.149769100662953
H value.	7.909474820348859
Which side now the hydrogen and r will come.	12.954993970701837
Anybody who gets into the room can occupy any of the seats and as many numbers of students can come in as long as they can occupy the number of seats available.	12.930311454151603
Gpc is also called sec size exclusion chromatography , because we will know now itself that the principle behind the separation of this polymer molecules is based on the exclusion of size.	11.964503525215255
If you have a anionic group and a carbon ion and if your counter is tightly bound , say , if you have lithium plus , you are doing a reaction with a n butyl lithium in a non - polar medium , then this carbon ion c minus will be having very strong tight ion pairs as we discussed in case of that conjugated diene polymerization; they will be very tight.	10.329649987505922
You always stand up for choosing amorphous material.	9.432101927906764
But even though there could be possibilities of this dispersion remaining in the polymer beads as impurities , so these are the disadvantages.	11.416342365088914
You can get isomerization.	9.86995257131686
Per unit carrier how much of the enzyme can be loaded and it is something like specific activity of a soluble enzyme preparation.	12.2054001700789
These are the reactants and these are the products.	9.141346785864739
Substrate binding sites are one of them.	10.200429668904722
So , total number of polymer solvent contacts , q would be , n 2 is the number of molecules , polymer molecules x , z minus 2 phi .	7.559835030285953
Now , let us talk about that , monomer reactivity , reactivities and chain initiation.	6.105862617437191
We saw that they carry out lot a large number of reactions.	9.445918864963234
We defined the second molecular rate which is m w bar or m w or m w which is weight , molecular weight which is defined at , in last case we had this , the mol fraction multiplied by the molecular rate of individual fractions.	9.859497429413956
So , many numbers of vibrations are possible , and each have a individual individual absorption in that higher region , so the higher spectra of polymers have lot of this absorption bands , and it is impossible very difficult to assign for a particular reason , or particular vibration , for all the absorption peaks in ir spectra for a polymer.	10.053296794820099
So , i can take this expression and write this k terms in terms of the arrhenius equation or else , we can simply write , ln r p from that earlier expression , m f to the power half i to the power half plus ln a p a d to the power , this is a d , to the power half a t to power half minus e p half e d minus half e t by rt.	9.47178408020907
It also true for normal radical polymerization that that the polymers are dead , which means that you , once the polymerization is complete you cannot take this polymers and add the second monomer to make a black copolymer , or something like rather that.	10.01568722565809
The second reason for the apparent change in km would be attributed to diffusional limitations.	8.778951788988282
A characteristic example of these kinds of enzymes is hexokinase.	11.757646410050398
So , it scatters more , and the transparency is transparency is very less , in fact , this is opaque.	11.008241726696088
To summarize whatever we have discussed today , the mechanism where by enzymes lower the free energy of activation for a reaction they catalyze can be grouped under following major heads : propinquity or approximation , orientation effect so that they are built into a proper orientation either through aligning some of the functional groups or by orbital steering , then strain or distortion effect on the bond which is desired to be broken during the reaction or strategic positioning of reactive functional groups in the active site.	9.540688340088826
To simplify the situation there is an equation available corresponding to michaelis menten equation which can be applied to allosteric enzymes.	9.953602703290645
That means if you carry out the reaction with substrate the maximum reaction rate velocity it reaches is vs.	7.727173912415786
On the other hand although the operational stability is not very high but the advantage is that the carrier can be regenerated and reused.	7.0387838467061385
As we realized in the beginning of this lecture as well , that as the more cyclic molecules , small molecules form , it affects both , the degrees of polymerization number , average degrees of polymerization and the weight average degrees of polymerization , but it affects more the number average degrees polymers compared to weight average degrees of polymerization.	8.215217811676814
But the destruction of or disruption of non - covalent bonds , non - covalent interactions will retain the protein molecule but we lose only the catalytic activity , catalytic function and that is what is the usual meaning of denaturation.	11.00385298530087
This is what it does.	6.884025875458872
You can also conclude that the faster reactions will have a smaller value of e *.	9.778989792407806
Now , what happened here as more and more reaction happen , the monomer concentration get depleted , so to supply more monomers this size of this , monomer droplets comes down , and it is supplied to this reacting polymer particles.	9.541346720115852
Now , some cases , this polarity , this steric effect , the polarity effect actually can help in polymerize or we overcome the steric effects.	9.866260983840748
If 90 percent of the fractional groups are reactive , when normal organic reaction is in small molecules; say , we have an esterification reaction , a 90 percent reaction means , you all happy; if you not happy you increase , do something to make a 95 percent reaction , then very happy.	11.576154986356466
Now , you seen that it can be shown that the radius of gyration can be found from the r m s , root mean square , the r m s end to end distance; and as i said earlier , the r m s end to end distance is useful for our elasticity and the radius of gyration useful for directly relevant to dilute solution properties and light scattering and it can also useful for branched molecules and cyclic molecules.	7.992379905229111
So , that is depends upon the movement of inertia , which is given by the shape and geometry of the specimen.	8.962923679585412
That is what we notice.	7.944905512115096
The same polymer can be achieved by a ring opening polymers of epsilon caprolactam and a self - condensation of 6 amino caproic acids.	9.467317701398422
This is very slow.	7.032028576111475
Whenever we analyze any given enzyme sample , we usually resort to both the basis : its initial reaction rate as well as protein concentration.	10.825052901351768
It basically measured as a ratio of reflectivity of it s , of a sample , to the reflectivity of a standard , and typically the standard is taken as a optically flat black glass , for a particular incident angle.	10.79139895995777
So , they flexi glass will be pmma from one supplier , with some other company.	9.370410695431065
After isolation from the cell you are trying to bring back because you see when they are in a living cell you have no means to study them excepting indirect calculation that this might be happening and this is the rate of flux.	11.470044629132039
Unless , you do not know the structure property relationship between the property , which enable the polymer to be at the final application , you cannot design the new polymers.	9.37598784692096
Now , if we talk about the other initiation process , like redox , number two is redox initiation.	6.850249754479819
The biochemical reaction kinetics will not have a major role to play and the whole thing will be controlled by the physical diffusion.	10.606322932218111
Vinyl acetate utilized to vinyl alcohol to make poly vinyl alcohols.	14.035889769231279
Polymerization side reaction is cyclization.	13.314635543764773
They will have higher reactivity towards a particular monomer.	7.91602274662597
A large numbers of methods of immobilization are reported in literature.	8.026919372518133
So if you have only one functional group in this case double bond , it is sufficient to give you linear polymers.	12.205462287944163
So , if you have more flexible group , instead of c h 2 c h 2, for examine three groups , three c h 2 groups , then the polymer becomes the contributions from this c o n h 2 group in this case , is higher compare to this case , because your adding more non polar groups.	8.573825620403424
Example of these primary anti oxidants , hinder diamines and secondary anti oxidants , and how they do this trapping or decomposition or increase in the rate of termination , we will discuss briefly now.	10.585966198549235
In the case of pfr , the expression changes to k m ln ( 1 - x ) = k 2e0 e.	5.015150203289242
It is not very usual thing observed for a monomer pair , but if that is the case , then both the monomer has a greater tendency to homo polymerize compare to copolymerize.	10.184076779853344
After the gel is formed then you can subject it to butyraldehyde to provide crosslinking and therefore get a permanently insoluble gel preparation.	10.147564948856118
If you look at this one , you will notice that from the estimation of jd factor as a function of c , renault number to the power minus n one can determine the value of kl.	8.43249199654744
Obviously if you have branches present in the polymer chain , it hinders in crystallization , so crystallization become difficult , so it affects the t m.	11.916224548623397
Because they have seen this propagation species are similarly charged , they cannot react with each other and terminate the chains.	9.351915830385769
If the polarity of the medium is slower , then they will become closer and closer.	8.3227373853606
Then percentage of transparency , is given by the fraction of light , transmitted , and deviated , through the metrics.	11.087899665898327
Our total orientation to study the inhibitors will be mostly directed towards the understanding the reversible inhibition.	10.58294595056972
We were discussing in this last lecture the termination by beta proton transfer to different species and we gave examples of the transfer reaction with monomer.	9.450004252261296
If you can divide or bisects the polymer into different parts then these values for f are available in literature.	8.584806762182367
But the ph effects are noted on a minor site in cases of gel entrapment and non - specific binding and particularly crosslinking effects also.	10.052279684822185
So , the principle is that you have pores in the column and the polymer molecules which are higher size they do not or cannot go inside this pores.	10.021011852561491
And if there are gel effect effect like gel effect and all this things were molecular weight shoots up at the end because the reason we talked about in the last class it could end up a p d i value of 5 to 1.	9.829268729636656
Therefore another feature is that the enzymes often show certain behavior which can be explained on the basis of coupling of more than one enzyme reactions where by we are able to produce certain net results which may look apparently to be non feasible but otherwise they follow all the laws of chemical reaction kinetics as well as thermodynamics.	11.074207864782435
One can also look at the double reciprocal equation , lineweaver burk equation , make a double reciprocal plot , see the nature of double reciprocal plot and identify the nature of inhibitor which we are talking about by understanding these.	10.65183671938994
Now , if we can , if you can do reactions where you do not have these side reactions or this chain transfer reaction , then you can keep this propagating cations , cationic propagating chains alive and you can get living cationic polymerization.	8.75027997910523
And this line gives you the configuration of the carbon atom.	9.607460524901676
For example , if i talk about a self initiated thermal polymerization , polymerization of benzene styrene a 100 degree centigrade this is percentage of conversation and this is time , is normally have reaction rate of reaction like this by time more propagation happenings.	10.01094196669872
Pvc plasticized means it by adding some additives which are called as plasticized t g is brought down.	12.10285387870769
Consider that the analytical solutions of a internal pore diffusion and biochemical reaction can be determined by a second order differential equation.	9.915788472807042
The enzyme molecule binds to both; substrate as well as inhibitor and the resulting esi complex is functionally inactive.	11.29234391699836
When m 2 is getting over all the m 2 is getting incorporated in the copolymer chain , you will get rest of the m 1s , which is remaining.	10.039899614344288
The fourth thing was he confirmed the concept of enzyme substrate complex.	7.188992658288531
Equilibrium constant k is k p by k dp is 1 by m at equilibrium now at i write e because this is an equilibrium.	11.924778408691932
Whereas in the case of enzymatic catalysis the loss of entropy as a result of combining into one entity is attributed in the binding process which are already taking place in the binding process.	8.174885131872749
For example , polymer air interface or polymer mold interface or interface between two polymeric phases in a blend , for example.	8.741550166316298
We have learned the classic continuous and classification that that detailed differences between your chain polymers and step polymers and then we studied the nomenclature.	9.958067697723338
Another general feature which gives you the properties or the characteristic of any type of inhibition pattern is degree of inhibition.	9.687732463250397
But in case if there is inhibition pattern that must be taken into account for analyzing the reactor performance.	7.494892298354478
We have also seen that functionally they are very efficient catalysts in the sense that they provide a very high degree of specificity , a very high degree of turn over number as far as their function is concerned.	8.283547914294648
At the initial rate the product concentration is zero and in general expression if we write p equal to zero you will arrive at initial reaction rate.	8.184043153038253
So it , does it mean that we know that t m from this curves we know that glass transition melting temperature is a melting is a first order transition , thermodynamic first order transition , but whether does this mean that glass transition is a second order transitions thermodynamically.	10.588337715218234
And this is obvious , that radical scavengers stops , radical inhibits radical polymerization whereas it has no effect on ionic polymerization and this is , this is what , why you take trouble of all these reaction conditions for ionic polymerization.	9.012194620369707
So , let us talk about the energetic , which means , that the effect of the temperature on the reaction rate and molecular weight , like in case of radical polymerization if you just recollect this , this is the expression for your r p , rate of polymerization , and this is the expression for your average degrees of polymerization.	7.257519051856364
You take feed monomer ratio with different f 1 values and stop the reaction say less than 5 percent conversion and quantify the amount of mole fraction of the monomer unit present in the copolymer at the end of this 5 percent or when you stop the reaction.	9.0776870970359
This is the example , the spectra for the first block , which is the tertiary block , the block of tertiary butylacrolate; now this this peaks corresponding to this 4 aromatic protons , so you cannot see properly.	10.799203984156158
Another parameter which they considered was the pressure drop; probably that they considered to find out the height of the column and they noted also that the pressure drop across the column bed followed very typical fluid dynamics expressions which are available and it was proportional to the space velocity as well as height of the column.	10.305928317725586
Once the reactants a and b bind to an enzyme molecule at the active site there are only half of the their degree of freedom that means they become one entity and they lose six of their degrees of freedom and thereby there is a loss of rotational and translational entropy and the transition state will have only three degrees of rotational and three degrees of the translational freedom each.	10.421926959786244
It forms the dispersion with the enzyme molecule and a collagen method is not exactly like a gel as we consider a poly acrylamide gel or an agarose gel or any starch gel.	10.721749613324388
The cases where transfer reaction present , the transfer constant goes down with decrease in temperature , as a result , that molecular weight goes up.	8.933412705572747
This is the actual input to the reactor and this is the exit stream which is going f1qc and this undergoes change in the concentration.	9.841901356217132
In many cases such a thing happens and such a behavior is often called as modern rack hypothesis today it is proven by many experimental designs that partial breakage of the bond can take place on the enzyme site but in earlier days people have thought of the concept that enzyme tears off the whole substrate molecule which has proven today by modern rack hypothesis and which illustrates that the enzyme can accommodate a substrate in which one of the bond which is required to be broken for catalytic reaction to take place can get distorted partially during the binding process thereby reducing the energy of activation.	9.799377973994766
So , please remember that for large expansion , this expansion factor is approximately proportional to the molecular weight to the power 1 over 10, and we know we knew that this unperturbed dimension was dependent on 10 to the power half.	7.776258744992616
Now , this is a special case where you do not see the concentration of product is appearing in your equilibrium constant , it is only the reactants.	9.388644844204597
The other types of , there are few other special type , or very , a small applications of other types of radical generation , or other type initiator; for example , there are electro chemical initiator , if you have a salt of carboxylic acids , and present in electro chemical cell , then in this carboxylic acids all can get ionized , oxidized to form a radical.	10.23759961179209
For example , phases of crystalline phases , in a semi crystalline material , the amorphous in the crystalline phases will have a different refractive index , so that will cause scattering , and for this reason actually most of the crystalline polymers are opaque in nature , because of the heavy amount of light scattering.	10.820911580009227
So , basically we are talking about pendent group size , we are not talking about this , we are talking about pendent group size and type.	7.055797795335751
Now , in this expression e e know this , we know this we know this , we know this , we know this , this is all known.	8.375176934296174
X is the number of structure units.	6.46478469906436
Relative quantity of enzyme required or the relative value of the space time required in pfr for increased fractional conversion is much , much higher in the case of cstr compared to pfr.	9.204894846977853
So , at , equilibrium constant is related to the concentration of the monomer in this case only.	8.692523660773736
It has been immobilized on to a solid matrix by some bonds; it could be an electrostatic bond; it could be a metal salt linkage; it could be covalent bond or it could also be as an entrapment within a gel.	9.952548886152488
If one of the orientation is preferred , much preferred , if one of the orientation of this incoming monomer molecules is much preferred over the others , then what happened.	9.31619280925706
So one can experimentally determine the magnitude of klam by carrying out the immobilized enzyme reaction in a continuous reactor and getting the steady state performance of the klam and from that km and k2e0 and once you know klam you also know the substrate concentration gradient sb - ss by the first equation where you have related the rate of mass transfer because that is klam . ( sb - ss ).	11.00110242308955
In the case of hollow fiber the system is something like in a shell and tube reactor; shell and tube heat exchanger type of situation where you have very fine capillary type of fibers which are semi permeable in which the enzyme can be entrapped.	9.49850210293873
Why , if you impact , because of its flexibility it can absorb that impact energy more effectively , and gives you a higher impact strength or it does not give a better facture on getting hammered by a impact or gamma by a load.	12.04096128044595
So , what is a conversion.	5.640496591837861
That is a very major understanding which we must appreciate.	9.972290638375993
This is having more , more polar , the intermolecular forces between the polyvinyl chloride chains are much higher compared to polypropylene chains.	8.57298199521
If you look at what we talked about kt = rt / nh x k * ( 6 ) you can also write k2 as k2 = rt / nh x exp ( - e * / rt ) ( 7 ) now this as all you know we call it as frequency factor which is often written as a.	8.182414382087925
But , beyond this yielding point , it will not come back to the original state so , permanent deformation happens so , this is a plastic.	8.943549840639959
Now , what we planned to study in this lecture is continuation of the strategies and now , we in this lecture would quantify the relation.	11.223593238613768
This alpha can be easily determined at t = 0and x = .	11.092959727378652
Hydrogen ion concentration is more in the carrier.	11.659743244909395
So obviously , if the temperature is higher , then it can rotate and form the isotactic polymer as well isotactic linkage and in that case if there is a random orientation of two asymmetric carbon atom , then you are going to get a syndiotactic molecule.	10.339140194007719
This is the dissociation constant ki , classical km and k.	9.542855457107514
The quaternary structure could be a dimmer , it could be trimer , it could be a tetramer depending on the number of chains present and the organization will really lead to the final conformation.	10.063602032889095
The second major advantage which has been noted in these cases is that if you use a regenerated carrier after the enzyme has been leached out , you again immobilize the enzyme on the regenerated carrier.	9.749862916264393
If you consider a first order case , then the reaction velocity will be v = kf amss kf i have defined here as a pseudo first order rate constant which is based on surface area; not volumetric rate constant; but the surface area based rate constant just to have a dimensional homogeneity with the mass transfer correlation.	9.27807571682606
Now , this value is quite high.	6.164138427128905
We cannot get the value of m w , m n and other average molecular weights from this raw graph.	10.591687042817048
In this lecture , i planned to cover kinetic chain length and the molecular weight of the polymer produced in radical chain polymerization.	5.9639584674788155
So , these are the other type of nomenclature we use.	6.697695731496249
So it will be k ln 1, again 0; number of different ways you can add in this solvent molecules , but unlike the ideal solution case s 2 is not equals to 0 here because the amorphous polymer chain has different confirmations and so you can actually arrange the polymer chain in different ways; not only one way like small molecules.	10.310826673892814
For example , if you have carboxylic acid like acrylic acid and then compare its copolymerization behavior over acryl amide , then we change in ph of the medium.	8.195411471472427
So , you get this expression.	3.6445838500465215
Ph electrode is a potentiometric transducer.	11.590483598189461
Just for simplicity i have written here and this is k.	12.899405554724664
We can easily distinguish and get the magnitudes of the values of the various kinetics parameters vm , ka , kb and k a and if the magnitude of k a is negligible or zero one can conclude that it is binary reaction mechanism and not ternary.	10.862557039507227
This is ki , the dissociation constant for the inhibitor.	7.914142707892031
It reacts with monomer , dimer , trimer and itself forming dimer , forming pentamer , hexamer , heptamer and so on.	8.173839928240296
It is not extended like a rod.	8.096068244006702
In this technique usually a tracer which is an inert material is put along with the feed stream.	9.53579970750933
That is the order of magnitude which the binding energy goes in the binding of the substrate.	7.779197536734311
T approaching zero you provide a small quantity of a tracer and then monitor the output.	11.058666150663516
It interacts with the water molecule freely and it is very mobile but when you put in organic non - polar medium its mobility is drastically reduced.	10.64610681735645
If you plot del g mixing first segment if you can get from this expression of what we just saw in this case , from this expression we will tell you it will give two general type of variation of this p and g with in this case say pie 2, of the polymer.	10.594302087240793
Here also , molecular weight increases slightly with increase in the temperature.	9.152810875394728
Emission spectra light it when we sign a light in a sample , it can absorb and then it can emit emit , may be in the same wavelength or different wavelength , and with the help of detector we can get a get the intensity of this emitted radiation.	11.268738691177768
Very broadly the effect of internal pore diffusion in a very simplistic way is described for isothermal reaction incorporated in the pore diffusional effects by k 2e0ss v =.	10.763388023785428
One example , very common nowadays used in research is polyanisopropylaclamide.	10.839091615406227
If you have a molecules which have only one functionality for example , instead of ethylene glycol you have a phenol molecules , then once this weights of phenol is reacted you , the chain does not goes , you you cannot make a polymers.	10.896687579088322
So at a room temperature , this has a crystalline structure.	10.602314175154149
They may only provide stability to enzyme substrate complex.	7.443245156225135
Once , you start this monomers containing the initiator will form droplets.	11.004160758138735
The most difficult part of the enzyme thermister is the very high order of insulation required because the temperature which we are measuring is probably a fraction of the integer; some times as low as 0.1 centigrade , one hundredth of a centigrade; that is the kind of temperature change we are talking about to ensure very high order of insulation and the effectiveness of this system depends on the quality of insulation one can provide.	11.291178958972887
So , we are telling this conformation as planar trans , and we can show this conformation in newman projection like this , this dots are ch 3 when this ch 3 groups are same side in the same plane , there are seems to each other , then we have a planar cis conformation , and this is shown by newman projection in this.	10.139531006440118
So , then this additives themself is not , or they would not decolour the polymer , but final compounds , when they form after stabilization , that could generate colour in the polymer matrix , that is the one drawback.	11.1862747738992
So , basically if you have very high molecular weight then the concentration at which the polymer starts from going , from becoming one phase system to two phase system is very low , if your polymer molecular comes down then this goes to little higher concentration.	8.255354744770507
We can get these from our r d r expression we derived in the last lecture as this.	8.975113960499383
The second thing is , on the basis of this binding process you develop a rate expression.	8.02389679195608
If we consider that the dissociation constant of activator binding to the enzyme is ka , then in that case the rate of such reaction can be expressed as vi = vm . s km { 1 + ka / a } + s you ultimately end up in a rate expression in which the km term is modified.	10.25608303791502
They can be written as k1, k - 1, k.	8.403781228833774
So , these are very high polymers which are high very high performance polymers we move to next say we have just given generic example of branching and cross linking in last lecture.	8.653560467862485
Alternatively you can also consider as a like a tangent series model because a plug flow reactor or plug flow pattern can be considered as a infinite number of cstr in series and plug flow can be considered as a cstr in series and if you can calculate based on the reactor performance , the number of cstr in series as equivalent to the plug flow that can quantify the reactor performance.	9.496941327087479
For example if you take this and react with a phenolic group of the enzyme molecule , it gives you a enzyme bound at the phenolic group.	9.38417646460787
Therefore by a double reciprocal plot at different concentrations of b and plotting the 1 / b versus the slope and intercept one can determine the values of the four kinetic parameters that are involved in a bi - substrate reaction that is ka , kb , k a and vm.	8.255081728729946
Polyvinyl alcohols are not produced from poly vinyl alcohol because vinyl alcohol does not exist in that.	10.909683957055563
Now , these are a not very common example of polymer synthesis or lots of industrial polymers are not used by this technique.	8.831724530066616
We also assume that the individual rate constant for the propagation steps where equal.	9.381659516431357
Now , you understood why we are bringing this concept of cyclization.	8.13892327499862
So eta s p by c can be written as , this is the slope of that linear relationship between eta s p by c with c and that is only applicable till eta r is less than .	9.48609307081831
The reaction may stop as soon as some concentration of the product and hydrogen ions are built up.	11.397768085660436
So , each polymer has these many contacts with solvents.	7.411620613881083
That means as soon as the ea of the first binary complex is formed the interaction with the second substrate forms a product , first product or it splits off to a product and a modified enzyme substrate complex which then reacts with b to form y.	9.485023988861368
It has been noted in most cases that the solvents which are relatively more non - polar are better suited for carrying out enzymatic reaction mainly because of their lack of interaction with the water layer on the enzyme molecule.	8.840226688544261
So , now , we can plot this as a combined function of c and theta.	8.250807105084997
So , often we need catalyst to make the reaction feasible.	7.874391087046763
Substrate concentration s0, changes at the exit.	14.33914395296904
Consider that after a certain period of time the reactor comes under steady state situation.	10.15247133743811
As a result of this approximation one can also consider another feature.	7.21157445799517
With small pull , they stretch out longer time.	9.882455962701568
Actually , there is no or very little de - polymerization reaction depending on of sling temperature of the polymer as well.	10.965727005974014
Now , depression a suspension polymers is similar to the bulk polymerization except that in this case , you have this tiny droplets which are dispersed in the aqueous medium , whereas in the bulk bulk polymerization , there was no such case.	8.867453735845409
Whereas , we have seen that , you after making the synthesizing the polymer you have to go through the processing step , to make the final part.	9.279286633486857
Even if the binding takes place this amino group cannot come in the vicinity of the catalytic site , cannot approach the catalytic site and no reaction can occur.	9.279506522956357
So , if i have some polymer chain , which branch having a a at the end , now what will happen.	7.528335274816112
Now pi is very small.	9.22104025801459
The same enzyme aspartase continuous operation in the packed bed reactor gives you the percentage of the l - aspartic acid recovered in the product stream and they carried out at two different substrate concentration 0.2m and 1m ammonium fumarate and the performance over the operating time is totally different as a function of new substrate concentration.	9.419538776378202
It can be used to express co - operativity index.	7.279386001068114
So , basically we can write or we can say that as a basic principle of light scattering that first principle is that amount of light scattering is directly proportional to the product of polymer molar mass m and concentration and this term which is specific refractive index increment.	10.207915978281118
And this energy gap between the vibrational states such that , that it it resonate with the electromagnetic radiation about , having wavelength of 1 micron to 15 micron.	10.311083036822627
You also know that x n bar , the number average degrees of polymerization is given by expression , we have deduced this expression in earlier lectures , so you should be knowing this very well , where b is the average number of initiator residues per polymer molecules.	8.886673259676387
Now this term is nothing but ln activity of the solvent.	7.998517522674594
Now if it has a planar geometry , when the next monomer comes in because it is a planar it can come from both the sides.	8.135644821227494
This is a c p cyclopentadienyl , c p 2 say titanium chloride , inclination of mao.	10.049298180921628
Or on the other hand if the biochemical reaction rate is very , very slow compared to diffusion or diffusion is very fast you might have a reasonable concentration of substrate even at the centre of the particle and therefore the apparent loss of enzyme activity may not be serious.	9.51454797590215
When i show it in expanded view , this time scale is probably only for few seconds.	10.203136698399476
The binding energy is a totally different game and therefore that should not be confused.	10.387726358295636
One can have such a profile and when one wants to analyze the reactor performance for any given immobilized enzyme system , one must really characterize a system with reference to such kind of profiles so that one can get a feel of the substrate concentration required and the fractional conversion required , one can choose where to bank upon.	10.60905441250068
There is no functional group in the backbone.	7.245101627774008
There is no porous network and in those cases if there is optimum temperature change it is attributed to conformational change and diffusional effects are also very prominent with respect to temperature effects mainly because the diffusion itself is a process which is very significantly affected by temperature.	10.544893564025703
Most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions will experience some kind of inhibition.	7.763193359191588
It will follow saturation behavior where the saturated reaction rate reaches to a value of vm , which is nothing else but k2 [ e0 ] and the reaction rate at half the value of maximum reaction rate was defined as kd , dissociation constant.	10.741035647929301
We discussed first the freely rotating chain , how the size the end - to - end distance , rms end - to - end distance comes about , we found that that is n to the power half multiplied by l.	7.089955303176029
They are very difficult to predict or estimate the reactivity ratios and as a result copolymer composition from given monomer structures.	9.96988039113486
So it is very important that all the reagents that have been used are free of oxygen.	9.887818590351369
You take enzyme particle , dry it and suspend into solvent and because they are not soluble they will tend to form lumps , aggregates that is what these aggregates are shown and they can be used to carry out the reaction.	8.556839329618333
So , this done in laboratory , in a escalated way , where basically the specimens are heated , in a elevated temperature , with some relative humidity , and with time the retention of properties are monitored , and then compared with an existing material , which is already in application , for long time.	10.341167762934694
At that time we had great limitation of analytical methods.	10.787000500256768
One more fundamental difference in case of radical polymerization with the step growth polymerization , i spent some time in lecture probably couple of lecture back.	9.656021223493916
These are typically you know , these are available in the fatty acid there are lots of fatty acid which are which can be unsaturated available where you have a unsaturation or double bond in a other side not necessary end , but other side.	10.892080352484008
When this activated matrix , we consider this as an activated complex , is further brought into contact with the protein or enzyme again some of the water molecules are replaced by the functional groups on the enzyme.	9.530014434736232
One of the sides is blocked.	7.860364098667837
The second category and probably which is of most significance to us as in the case of immobilized enzyme systems are continuous flow reactors because the major purpose of the immobilizing enzymes is to use them in continuous modes or repeated mode.	8.687354578649225
So , nu is the average number of monomers which is getting polymerized per radicals.	7.576919191484832
And i will very briefly covered the other properties like thermal , environmental , barriers , surface , electrical , optical , fire resistances , etc.	9.74624061617316
It could be three point bending test or four point bending test , is like stresses or strain is applied in bending direction so , higher the modulus as bending will be lower.	9.067314372562643
The glucose can enter into more than one metabolic pathway.	11.709613821703268
Simple example where i can compare the reaction which can take place both by chemical catalyst as well as by enzymes is hydrolysis of hydrogen peroxide that is break down of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen , a very common reaction that takes place in living cells by the enzyme catalase.	11.748867980974287
If you if you rotate the c 2, c 3 on clockwise direction , you will get this conformation , if you put in anticlockwise direction , you will get this other conformation.	9.014327534615466
This is a trimer consists of monomer molecules and this is tetramer consists of four monomer units or structural units.	9.783766628074158
Now what is the chance that all the z cells are vacant; remember the lattice already has x i number of block cell.	8.94302008664991
Now , as i said that fortunately there is a relation for large n and for linear molecule.	7.456590416389293
This q e scheme , which basically takes care of the resonance stabilization and the polarity part and basically have values for different monomers and from that values , we can actually predict the copolymerization behavior of the 2 different pair of monomers.	10.386853049827778
The a class refers to grafting of the enzyme to a pre - formed water insoluble functionalized polymer.	10.62429935716139
So , in most cases to find a polymer , these polymers are synthesized in a plant from raw materials which are monomers by the process , which are termed as polymerization.	9.57152373592521
While in the case of the first , the monomolecular gluteraldehyde residues , they give you cross linking reaction between the enzyme molecule particularly amino groups of the enzyme molecules are involved in cross linking and you get a chain of the enzyme protein which gets aggregated and gets precipitated.	10.84768297427156
However , if you remember , that the in case of temperature effect of photo chemical reaction , which is little more complicated because the initiators , which produces radical photo chemically , they also produce radical at a higher temperature.	11.24146389318951
In anionic polymerization , we , we had discussed two types , mainly two types of initiator , one was organo - metallic compounds and another was electron transfer through electron transfer reaction.	9.611359343597737
So , these are all t i initial thermostat temperature of the medium.	6.352950036007254
What solid by state , i mean that it is not flowing in the condition where we are using.	11.74625341225458
We can write the value for c i n i m i by v and c is basically summation of c i.	8.812940626989686
That means dialysis is something like an artificial organ; it s like an artificial kidney that you take out the blood and put it in an extra . . ..	9.709743904602854
They are also used in packaging material as like bottles , box - lids and they are also used in wire and cable insulations for electrical valve and they are also used in some of other uses of surgical and protective gloves.	9.588873074498954
This is diamines and this is diacids.	12.715204110147305
Another option available to us is instead of eh , e - or the negatively charged enzyme is the active form.	9.73516680368273
Now , i was telling little earlier that now you can draw similar lines like let me try and then join this spinodal points.	8.644322803227643
Look at this monomer maleic anhydride we know the structure of maleic anhydride.	12.171628483062364
In that , vacant d - orbital and titanium gets alkylated.	9.846545599646545
So , unless there is a specific requirement like you are making a specialty polymers like then there is no point of making these polymers by these ionic methods.	9.499279272172718
And or carry a stress without suffering permanent deformation and it is indicated by the elastic limit or the yield point , beyond yield point the elasticity the sample actually undergoes permanent deformation.	10.707651085756027
The major reason is that ultimately the objective of an immobilized enzyme system will be to have a very high activity.	9.002680758362656
Now let us talk about how to calculate this combinatorial or configurational entropy and we are continuing our discussion with most simpler system of ideal solution.	7.757134947872688
Now , what is the sign of this entropy of mixing of these things.	7.978643536610806
So , they also used in applications where string and link requirement for high temperature.	7.579329123296984
You can see what we have observed , this is experimental curve for observed for solutions having polymer and solvents having upper critical solution temperature.	9.649253769541783
Now before we end this lecture , let us go through the commercial , a few commercial coordination polymers.	9.77267671546316
The cost of the carrier and the regeneration capacity are directly linked.	7.761050154372648
Therefore for different molecules of reactants to react collisions must take place.	9.320099255285594
So , the monomers can attract each other and do the reaction.	6.731409383725755
Here , the proton is transferred to the counter ion itself.	10.203997079742258
That means we define a term degree of inhibition called i which is nothing but v0 - vi / v.	10.02593155094387
So , with this you can generate free acid group and a alkene group here , at this is very common by if you have a beta hydrogen present then by doing a 6 membered considered reaction , it might do a side reaction.	9.599484260400944
And for example , if we consider the beta proton transfer to monomer , i can write k transfer monomer just like the radical polymerization.	7.877058319960512
So , that is b , with the lewis acid i can write generic structures like mx n for lewis acids.	8.455770762846264
Now , this valid for dilute solution when no intermolecular interference and this also valid for low scattering angles which comes to an equation from like this.	8.114657477890571
If n a is the number of functional group present at the beginning at t is equal to 0 and n b is a number of functional groups of b present at t is equal to 0, so what are the total number of a molecule at t is equal to .	8.160400289697238
And one thing if you look at this scattering factor p theta versus scattering angle; now , if you have some approximate about you know length of the molecular weight of your polymer then you know how this polymer or how the scattering factor p theta will vary with scattering angle.	9.781194836054253
And then , the inherent gas is injected through to inflate this tubular profile , till it get the shape of the mold.	8.776685149564873
So , as a result , radical polymerization is done at comparably higher temperature and typically higher than 50 degree centigrade in the lab and the industry.	8.402781088435127
The enzyme , water soluble enzyme is mixed with an aqueous solution of the appropriate polyelectrolyte.	10.810668295795491
This is basically empirical equation depending upon the reaction operational data the height required for effecting the mass transfer across that film.	9.686044108558129
Therefore carrier cost becomes coupled with the cost of immobilization particularly in terms of chemicals it becomes quite high.	10.970288564871497
Glycerol as we know is ch2oh - choh - ch2oh.	15.55546980280761
Another would be obviously less than .	9.588565135594898
How these double bond is polarized , is it the electron deficient or electron rich and steric effect.	11.577298892092092
For example , if i consider a case of halogen acids like hx and take the generic structure of the monomer with the reaction , we put on electrophilic reaction , it will form the same initiating species , but because this halogen anion is , is so strong nucleophile , it will actually combine again and form a covalent bond.	10.287832438335574
These three things must be clearly outlined.	11.360617820682391
More reflection means the reflective will be higher , and that depends upon angle of incident of the light , and angle of refraction , which in turn depend on the refracting index of the medium.	10.41279821315463
But in the case of protein adsorption when we are talking about enzymes , we are talking about proteins and macromolecules , adsorption over a narrow range of temperature offers a reverse phenomena.	8.987180808400678
But , on expanding it has to come in contact with the solvent molecules , with the solvent molecule solvent molecules do not like , so they will try to compact the polymer chain.	9.353217065990636
Now , let s talk little more about this two points and this two points c d and e f.	8.688481943704918
Then the second factor which is responsible for loss of enzyme activity is steric hindrance.	7.421581550722398
We would like to make certain assumptions before we go into the reactor performance and the assumptions are that first thing we are assuming that the reactor undergoes an isothermal operation.	9.627684282393062
Where in case of radical polymerization x n varies each time the dead polymer chains are forming.	9.084556250955622
And if this electron withdrawing group which basically reduces the electron density on the double bond.	7.928005603545544
So , like this curve , no matter what is your r , you can only reach up to this level.	8.255866977464752
You have a large variety of carriers that can be used.	7.689528011938565
In the case of porous matrices a very large quantity of fraction of total enzyme which is immobilized is within the pores of the particle.	6.17978364859767
We had also seen earlier the factors that affect the choice of different reactor types and to recall some of the factors that we had talked about the most important ones are listed here like form of the enzyme.	10.648228600538186
It is a two stage ester exchange process , first stage dimethyl terephthalicd m t is reacted with excess of ethylene glycol at say around moderate temperature and methanol is distilled out to form this compound.	10.040626274469792
Physical interpretation of.	15.835251657729776
And in this case as we see that , most cases making block copolymer by this method is difficult , so that is why the reason why , is almost cases , this is the processes applied to make block copolymer.	9.961898635953048
You can notice that in a living cell the enzyme is not as unstable as we notice it in the laboratory or pharmaceutical applications.	9.674715266237568
See if we consider the elution volume v e for a particular polymer sample as v 0 plus k s c into v i where v 0 is the volume outside the pores whereas , v i is the total volume inside the pores; and k is k s c is the equilibrium constant which basically is given by the concentration of the polymer sample inside divided by concentration sample outside the pores.	10.81402564609268
So , this is a vinyl acetate radical plus styrene monomer , vinyl acetate radical plus vinyl acetate monomer , styrene radical plus styrene monomer , styrene radical plus vinyl acetate monomer.	6.880319536633241
If we increase the temperature of your reaction then what happens , m e goes up.	6.865756306243759
Amorphous polymers are mostly clear and crystalline because this domain , crystalline domains will scatter light.	11.094362172888923
The theoretical chromatographic adsorption column must operate as a plug flow column but ultimately because of certain non - ideality there is some kind of broadening.	11.226863402389833
K a is the dissociation constant for binding of a to the enzyme.	8.17195912611087
Such reactions are very often noted to be poisonous in nature.	9.294122645048605
When you substitute those you get a rate expression as k3.e0.a . b v = k - 1k3 / k1k2 + k3 / k1 b + k3 / k2 a + a . b again the same pattern of generalized rate expression that we noticed in the case of ternary complex formation and both the type of ternary complex formation will follow the same pattern.	10.273489994668381
It will behave in a different way.	8.572118280738255
Now , how can we make sure that this counter ion and the active chain end are tightly bound.	7.70977668434831
What is the relation between conversion and excess in the molecular weight.	7.952839074769571
You can clearly see , that with increase in temperature , here temperature goes up , this values of transfer coefficient , transfer constant goes up and if this transfer constant goes up , that means , what will happen.	8.915642681006329
This activated nad is coupled with the polyacrlyamide hydrazide and this on coupling gives you a water soluble large molecular weight coenzyme analogue which is functionally compatible with the dehydrogenase which you want to use and similar systems can be designed for use.	10.97467053973158
That means the molecules do undergo certain collisions.	8.950647319544691
As a rule of thumb it is still valid today.	9.221566739956232
Now , if you have say polyethylene molecule or say polystyrene molecule; obviously , the rotation , the rotational freedom across the single bond will be much lower in case of polyethylene than polystyrene , because of bulky substituent , the rotation across the single bond will be restricted in case of so , polystyrene is a stiffer chain , we will say that this is the most stiffer chain than the polyethylene , or in other words , polyethylene is a more flexible chain than polystyrene; but still , in spite of being this phenyl in side group , it is still , it is also having significant freedom across the single bond , rotational freedom across the single bond.	9.76313737323834
So , basically if you have cyclic ethers say tetra hydro firen or a di oxine they do not undergo polymerization.	7.757113198030913
Whereas , 5 member ring are strained due to eclipse confirmation and 7 8 member ring having also strained because of transformations.	10.14705445392887
Now , what are the ways you can tackle this , one thing you can do if you find that their monomers are getting volatilized during the reaction.	6.694657111610184
That means if you make a plot between ln v = 1 / 2ln es you will get a linear fit and that can be checked experimentally by making preparations of different enzyme loadings and merge in them enzyme reaction . . ..	8.74237332769487
So , basically now by studying the angular variation of p theta we can get information about the size of the polymer molecules.	6.9494177415733995
This is example of block copolymer and there is another version of the block copolymers , where you might have a backbone of homopolymer and so on and from which you may be hanging chains of another block , then we call this as a graft copolymers.	9.034333531232638
If the a surface is not smooth; say it has rough , then the lights which are getting reflected specularly , from different region , they will have different distance to travel to the observer.	10.75909242047857
If you have pendent groups present on the substituent present regularly , then it is easy to pack or packing it becomes better , so t m goes up.	7.592689929349501
The way this model works is that you put the chain end at the origin of the 3 d coordinate and found out what is the probability that the other chain end would be at distance of r from the origin; say , if you put this x y z , then the probability of that the other end would be at point x y z which is having a distance r from the origin would be given by , right.	9.705090367045019
And this is we talking a continue our discussion on radical copolymerization so it is applicable for radical copolymerization.	8.878002120760428
And in other case of chain reaction you can do it with lower reaction temperature as well because the reactivity of these monomers are quite high.	8.455118630467538
You need to design enzyme reactors which can take care of transfer of materials; transport of energy , transport of momentum and all transport processes can be taken care.	10.58848115885461
If it is the chain is not difficult to rotate , the single becomes difficult.	8.968146432686568
In all the situations the performance of the reactor is lowered compared to what we look for by analysis in the case of an ideal fluid flow pattern.	9.957904483088178
You buy a cheap processing you can make , take the polymers which is comes in after from the lab or in a plant and you can do the polymer processing , do a process and make or give that polymer a very nice shapes of your choice and give good style which is not possible with the traditional materials like glass and metals.	10.544049337364553
That means there are no actual dispersions and so the velocity profile of the feed stream throughout the length of the reactor is flat or in other words the feed inlet , the feed stream moves almost like a plug and therefore the name what we talk about as a plug flow reactor.	8.60763599752637
This was anionic initiator , if you have a cationic initiator for this case , then if it has to react , and form something like this.	9.289422184483966
So , the end - to - end distance in this case , distance between two ends , two carbon atoms present in the ends at 3.9 ampere , and in this case 2.9 ampere and as you have , you can understand and this is more stable conformation than this.	9.801920059460162
A variety of types of tracer inputs are inserted into the vessel.	10.623914937766166
And at the end of the polymer also polymerization also , if the viscosity of the resulting you are your final polymer is very high then processing also becomes very difficult.	9.32482574024871
The midpoint of these two , some people consider this as a t g , and some cases what happened , the point where there is a maximum change in the slope , during this inter temperature in the slope changes , keep on changing.	11.942169914978626
The concentration of e - is negligible.	8.31355876005398
With the help of that , the polymer chains can slowly align themselves and form crystalline regions.	9.880635813686437
Some uses this inflection point , the inflection point as t g.	9.890129386066953
Now , they are big benches; we can occupy any chairs if you choice; so , all 50 of you distributed in the 5 benches.	10.06287507377589
But if we plot this rayleigh ratio; so what we will do we will start from.	8.374138380335085
We start with an acrylamide monomer which is water soluble.	9.219825597825889
The requirement for this type of transformation is this , because we know the definition of m n is given by where w is the weight fraction of a polymer chain having molar mass of m i and we can express this in terms of an integral form like this.	10.96974403891301
So far we have been talking about the status of enzyme technology as is being practiced in the industries as for the application of enzymes are concerned in different sectors of their application.	8.49555056710725
Now , let us consider a case where we have this system aa and bb with slight excess of bbb.	8.00990926536216
So , rayleigh ratio is basically this expression and delta r theta is nothing but rayleigh ratio for the particular theta for the solution minus rayleigh ratio for the solvent.	9.084258680398225
For most of the patients suffering from leukemia one of the problems is their lack of asparagine.	12.233636023620782
So , we can write nu as r p rate of polymerization by rate of termination , rate of polymerization given by k p m dot.	6.794073864936204
So , for a single metal , say , if we consider titanium , then again the lewis acidity increases with the oxidation number.	9.157549982836061
So , there will be no change in volume after mixing of the components.	7.412329442520552
Very often wherever the substrate is also a charged molecule similar partitioning effect will take place.	9.05167706540653
Now as the technique suggest this is using the dilute solution of viscometry.	10.341353918194669
The reaction rate being high , the diffusion became limiting.	12.159335451352634
Now let us put or place the solute and solvent molecules; solute are and will be shown as number 2 in this course and it is typically shown as 2 and solvent will be represented as .	10.5086289234481
The aggregation is less , so as a result if you decrease the temperature the aggregation become less , so the reaction become faster , so the reaction rate goes up.	10.53569983704262
So in chain polymerization , you have , finally when the polymer formed , you get a head tail head tail arrangement , not any of these , if , whether it is a head or tail does not matter , you can have a tail head tail head tail head arrangement as well , does not matter , but it is basically alternate , head tail head tail head tail type arrangement in the polymer structure of the monomers.	9.420898203115385
These two monomers can react by itself.	8.333594988692921
Again a peptide bond is formed.	8.899502906468685
So , when i talking about the reactivity it would also include the diffusivity diffusivity aspect of the monomers is well.	10.025964885220565
It will be only the residual amino acids and the two ends one will have a carboxylic group and other will have an amino group free and both these groups will be free to ionize at any given ph.	9.841328400808674
Now , if you have a radical which can undergo reversible addition to this s is a form r s , this is let us put at carbon.	8.914785263697201
Now , this can be given by n 0 by n; if n 0 is the total number of monomers at the beginning , and n is the total number of chains present at after polymerization or some time.	7.7020429881984835
Now , in this case , if both are less than 1, you will get a line like this which will cross over in this point.	7.014300099092679
So , at the time , you apply the state , it will strain to some extent , and then keep on continually forming , till the load is present.	9.962488696085943
Obviously , first thing happened that it , when it just heat the polymer surface , or the part surface , it can get scattered from the surface of the polymer , if the surface is rough , and of course reflection , part of the light gets back to the original medium by reflection.	11.380377524465963
That is the effect of ph as far as the ionization of enzyme active sites are involved.	8.105560571552806
This explanation of the specificity was purely based on certain observations and analysis of the situation mostly mental and not analytical because not many analytical facilities were available.	10.677482503013872
If i want to add another molecule , another segment , not molecule; if i want to add another segment where it has to stay of course unlike the small molecules where the molecules are apart from each other.	8.236152331649096
Once that takes place , still the catalytic sites are not approached by the functional groups which are likely to undergo reaction.	10.54184256897626
So , we will come back to the next class with this.	5.393634706025127
So , basically what i again telling that , the scattering amount of scattering , depends upon the refractive this mismatch.	9.803168651343894
One of the two , which is larger , is required to be considered.	10.3530072819518
Now , these steps are part of propagation.	7.3766972239012665
You require very high temperature to , generate a radical form that initiator molecules , and also this , radical the initiator molecules would generate radical , in a moderate rate , so that they can be utilized in the reaction , it should not be very fast.	9.781287511103843
So , each initiator generates and also , each initiator , if you are talking about organic butane lithium or say , sodium and naphthalene electron transfer reaction , each initiator molecules actually generates single carbanionic center , active center.	9.45198201615256
There is no question of change if they are rigid in nature.	8.437915364054016
One cation cannot react with another cation , cationic propagating species and terminate the reactions in case of radical.	10.611729190628473
So , t g is very low; minus 120 degree.	9.093766813232788
A very important factor is amount of water present.	9.211012949893544
Again similar considerations as we talked about in the case of michaelis menten kinetics.	7.117511742816368
Now , in this case , we go back and see how we define the average degrees of polymerization , x n in this chain polymerization is a number of monomer polymerized by the number of polymer chain.	7.285511102996845
What is clarity , clarity of ability of the sample , to transmit the find details of , the object view through of.	9.745835671840968
We started and we are half way in that discussion.	10.272583043273315
So , from third to last will be z minus 1 because one is already blocked; one of the neighbors is already blocked.	9.61675611151722
These molecules can be polymerized using uv radiations in the presence of a photoinducer , a catalyst , and benzoin ethylether is used in most cases as an inducer for photocrosslinking.	10.93387673498311
In case of step polymers the monomers as you have seen from the earlier pages that monomers disappears early from the reaction whereas , in case of chain polymers the monomers disappears steadily with time and as monomers disappears you get high molecular chains forming and typically even step growth polymers you have heteroatom in the backbone whereas , in the chain polymers typically are formed by the carbon backbone.	9.936223738290122
We can only approach to vm and for all practical purposes the substrate concentration that is chosen is roughly of order of about greater or equal to hundred km values.	9.15624886659588
A reaction with a turn over number of 104per second means so many numbers of molecules of substrate is converted to product per mole of the enzyme which is a very large turn over number as against a turn over number of ten.	11.355203871457302
If you look at the first one , the a , it is a homogeneous system containing individual enzyme molecules , water and water miscible organic solvent.	8.175480488939758
This also limits to a single substrate reaction.	9.024528307871352
L is less than one that means in this region , the value of f is approximately equal to one.	6.305477423679912
In such a case the typical profile that will be obtained of ph will be a bell shaped curve with the ph optimum at the middle of it which we consider as the typical profile and vm.	9.297479092165576
And that will lead to cis monomer formation whereas if you increase the polarity of medium , then obviously the active chain end and the counter will be well separated , well solvated; so there will be apart from each other , separated from each other.	9.01938539539554
A large number of correlations giving the values of c and n have been proposed under different conditions and one of them which needs the actual reaction conditions can be chosen from the literature and used for estimation of jd.	10.394648387120025
The conventional use of enzymes in therapeutic has been the use of proteases.	12.814702715837843
Kappf can be used to designate the reactor performance of the first order immobilized enzyme reactor with film diffusion limitations or film diffusion control.	12.48559615953372
Now , if the reaction is slow , slowed down , then the dispersity problems comes , you know the polymer has become much broader and the heaviness becomes difficult to maintain , so there strategies , which are utilized to minimize this side reactions is especially for the polar monomers.	10.451841461995514
For example here the enzyme species are three so we will take all patterns that have two steps only two steps and nothing else and those patterns will be considered.	9.513530626962183
So , basically again if the backbone of the polymer chain increases , the stiffness of the backbone of the polymer chain increases or the t g goes up or the flexibility increases , the t g comes down.	7.704377026741717
But note that all the contaminants are revoked which may not be required because any order of purification will mean additional cost , enhancement in the value of the product.	10.281038073429217
Now a solution in the solvent , chemical potential is lower than in the solvent so the vapor pressure of the solvent in the polymer solution will lower.	10.288827572802438
Let us look at this cartoon , if you compare as collection of small molecules or short molecules like a sugar and a long molecules which is a polymer sample.	10.240706738945603
Most of the inducers for many enzymes very often are the substrate molecules themselves.	9.58183685318352
But if the interaction factor alpha is very , very small , at each stage affinity will increase by a very significant level or what we understand as co - operativity is very high.	7.98040698969088
One macro mole of product formed per minute of the reaction can be considered as one international unit.	9.946159652023002
And some cases or some people also prefer to write this is d l or we know this is d or l but if it is d then this is l; if it is l then it is d.	11.877799144304449
You can get it from this expression and it is not very significant.	8.255458314513039
So , so other protonic acids like h 2 so 4 or say , hclo 4 or phosphoric acid.	8.930772880184938
Suppose , this b comes here and you have b b.	12.377535877467054
In some other application , which work other type of surface like polymer mold surfaces , to improve the mold release property of the polymer polymer material polymer material mole release are added.	10.916471169353525
It could be any of this species , which we wrote here.	9.217299512949404
If you look at the polis polystyrene obviously polystyrene will not soluble in water and methanol , but it polystyrene almost soluble in most of this solvents.	8.919368517227044
In terms of the total gross weight of the product for example if you look at the total immobilized enzyme preparation almost ninety nine points will be contributed by a carrier.	10.511097728103488
There are three constraints.	10.464073134672946
In those cases living cells are used and usually these living cells have been immobilized by adsorption method because when they are living on the adsorption method although it is a method which regularly leaks out the cells from surface but then the new cells which are growing during growth phase they can also bind to the surface and then.	10.776934803212267
So , from this you can get the value of the intrinsic viscosity.	5.954904192261982
It is coming from the expression we used in the last page.	9.2055801539982
You know in this case of styrene you have polystyrene in this case.	8.979982386592331
And then we will begin the important discussion on polymer characterization which is basically how to determine polymer molecular weight.	7.483107789533135
So , chains are initiated all at once because initiation steps are much faster.	8.78790612557469
If it is a 3, 4 addition , we can recall the molecule; this is one , this is two , this is three , and this is four.	13.866173240279068
The basic advantage here is that the method is based on the peptide bond which is very unique as far as the proteins are concerned.	9.631723621576558
The flow rate we typically work the gpc s work like in the range of 1 ml per minute.	9.783120208579094
Because many of the carriers although expensive , can be used for a long period and in number of repeated cycles.	11.375364738771385
We discussed that glass transition temperature is a secondary transition , glass transition is a secondary transition , and melting is a first order transitions for polymers.	8.99101319607465
So , what is typically done.	5.887168882179281
In summary the broad objective of this course as i mentioned so far will be to study various scientific , technological and engineering aspects associated with the application of enzymes as a bio catalyst in process industry.	10.334162537523426
And if diffusivity increases , with the decrease in the size of the gas molecules.	9.450707349121853
Many of the specific systems require intervention of enzymatic catalysis for safe disposal of the waste emerging from a particular industry.	10.117860933520845
Average degrees of polymerization and this nu , if the polymerization is done by coupling , coupling , then m n would be , x n bar would be , the average degrees of polymerization would be twice nu; nu is the average number of monomers consumed in this chain.	9.786658381789197
And , we have sub - temperature or sub - temperature conditions , where these two transitions takes place from gas to liquid state at volume point and from a liquid to solid state as a freezing point.	9.823403145466575
So , this type of model , 3d lattice model is quite justifiable.	8.042874800301258
Now , long range interactions are coming , because the fact that once a bond occupies a given volume in this space , no other bond can occupy the same volume , so if i have a bond here in the space , the same space cannot be , if i have this in this planes if you consider a bond , then you cannot , then like this let this plane is bond , you cannot occupy the same space with another bond.	9.648191307487654
The immobilized enzymes will also find use in sensors that means the electrodes if you want to have an analytical tool in the form of an online sensor in that case one looks for the immobilized enzyme preparations which can detect a particular product of interest.	10.481680527171807
For that of course , we need to know the absorption behavior of the individual homopolymer , like in this case called polybutadiene , and the polystyrene.	12.1631490034891
Only initial phase changes and the first one is typical hyperbolic profile , the second one is the sigmoidal profile which is exhibited by allosteric enzymes.	10.529400586099674
Hydrolysis of proteins or even glucose syrup can undergo bacterial contamination.	12.797688861006524
If you look at the same data , as we looked in the case of amino acylase , in the case of aspartase they also carried out variety of immobilization methods including the physical absorption , ionic binding , covalent binding and entrapments.	9.73394980313324
So , if you plot with 1 over t , this is the curve for r p and this will be curve for your x n , x n bar.	9.156510782091813
Now , you have the monomer droplets along with the initiator molecules has a small droplets which are dispersed in the aqueous solution.	8.361996363763739
If you look at these numbers here , k p k d to the power half k t to the power half , here k d is in the down.	7.652181857694021
Then one looks at the effect of inhibitor on the michaelis menten constant and the maximum reaction velocity of reaction.	8.583703563431833
So , the propagation reaction is fast and termination reaction is much faster.	8.03949766978807
And , also this k 3 is the; the value of k 1, k 2 and k 5, they have much higher value compared to k .	10.165329866356252
Now , if you talk about weight fraction , then the weight fraction of different chain length molecular weight was maximum for a given molecular weight.	7.894364167938236
If k and a are not known , what you need to do.	7.2258712229233675
Only when the hydrogen ion concentration becomes smaller than k or ph becomes greater than pk , log vm = log vmtrue log k + log h + the hydrogen ion concentration will influence , vm will be decreased and you get a downward fall.	9.769366056653567
Therefore i think one should very clearly understand the relationship between fractional conversion , enzyme quantity required or the space time and productivity.	10.740635985649707
Polycarbonate has carbon plus oxygen in the backbone.	11.427810836601425
The other factor which is important to be considered is enzyme loading.	7.564955633884829
So , you have to name according to iupac or is very complicated name , complicated structure where common names are very difficult like co polymers and and so on , the kind of structures are very difficult commonly then you apply this iupac nomenclature procedure and name the polymer.	8.73388943735211
You can have either way; also you can put your enzyme into a column and pass it through a spectrophotometer; that can be automated; no doubt about it.	9.871994841028767
Now , always its try to avoid these acrylonitrile solvent specially for this carbon tetra chloride and carbon tetra boride type solvents.	8.746314674410177
So , if i take this this part then it this consist of four structural units , but only two repeat units and as i said degree of polymers is number of structural units , and the molecular weight of polymer molecules is degree of polymerization that means number of structural units multiplied by the average structure unit.	9.06941590039016
So , how many groups it has we have to count groups there 2 c h 3 groups 1 c h 2 group.	8.467488134107256
In all other cases the chain transfer happens then molecular weight will come down.	9.146351396165354
So , these are the examples , typical example of this azo compounds of this.	6.3985802619526915
As i said most cases synthetic polymers are prepared or synthesized from monomers which are derived from petroleum resources.	9.407113085137475
So for each data point we can develop a straight line.	8.857119378284287
So , that is , that we are defining this term and we are assuming for simplicity , that , this is the condition we are having.	9.154195890570934
The third item we have seen is the inhibition pattern which the kinetic reaction follows and probably another pattern which is very , very important in analyzing the immobilized enzyme reactors is the reactor type and operational stability.	10.488124254267563
Similar to stiffness , and the magnitude of the elastic modulus is a measure of rigidity , elasticity is the ability to undergo reversible deformation.	10.219940910555255
When you talk about the solution phase then this values will be similar.	9.21484733045812
For example , if you take aibn , you have seen that aibn on dissociating to this , this species; now , they can again recombine by reacting with themselves and form these molecule.	9.743008725068814
They have high turn over number.	7.304659826738798
So the inhibitory effect will be totally masked.	10.709333841089187
So , this type of solvent dependent reactivity was absent in case of radical chain polymerization.	5.768874402114453
H in the case of catalase , it is 100.4 kilo joules per mole.	13.220113765128676
Today briggs and haldane s kinetics has become a universally accepted reaction kinetics which is followed all over the world to understand the enzyme catalyzed reactions.	8.93862265944776
That when you cool a polymer melt , it is not possible for the entire polymer must , to crystallize mainly because of there is not enough space or you are not giving enough time to the polymer chains to arrange or align themselves in a crystalline manner or maybe the polymer chemical structures do not allow them to align in a regular manner.	10.61920277995795
Now , let us compare between first styrene and alpha methyl styrene.	5.137353432985276
So , this would have been the time average value.	6.247847484404586
So , you cannot make a step polymerization of high molecular weight , where pdi is narrow.	9.153610537998349
These adsorb preparations are usually in dynamic equilibrium.	10.626569015966961
This hypothetical situation will never emerge because there will always be equilibrium between enzyme , free enzyme , substrate and the enzyme substrate complex.	8.599291104773323
There can be a membrane through which the product or any other species which comes out as a result of reaction passes through and approaches transducer , an analytical device which generates a signal that can be monitored.	10.135390851182684
What is there mechanism and surface migrating of additives.	10.483031644268078
This is the volume of this particle.	7.249459329152812
We assumed the stability behaviour of enzymes.	8.970611852234864
It is not only polarity , but the capability of the solvent molecules to solvate the ionic species giving the chain propagation.	9.733664557240452
It usually leads to a fast method and most common method used in the laboratories.	12.143524818103586
In case of kinetic control , as i said , that it does not maintain the equilibrium.	7.852486112241713
Large varieties of carriers have been used and are available for use fortunately and these carriers have been classified by various people in different modes , in different forms.	10.68183640787882
Polymer or these polymers can be also imagined like this , where head and head is linked and a tail and tail will be linked to next monomers.	11.027402146536398
But even traces of oxygen can reduce degree of polymerization in the polymerization reaction.	8.370251333367678
If this is r then it will be s whereas in this case they have same configuration; if this is r then there also r.	10.231926380966138
So , this statistically does not have any significance in terms of final polymer product , in terms of their molecular weight or molecular distribution.	9.593304132719664
You can write down the expression ln s0 / s 1 k 2e0t + = s0 - s km k m ( s0 - s ) from the equation two if you just simplify you get a straight line equation which can give the values of km and vm.	9.08242014694997
We just simply consider these the irreversible process.	9.163485733148223
One of the disadvantages here is the stability of this material.	8.217356946804268
So , this is one way we can determine the theta temperature.	6.40499369881525
It s an observed change.	8.753944376582389
Now , with time the value of m and i changes.	9.78292159824362
Then we have looked at the effect of mass transfer on the reactor performance by virtue of steady state analysis of mass transfer and biochemical reaction taking place simultaneously in an enzyme reactor.	8.022209186483325
All the globular proteins are known to be soluble in aqueous medium and so are the enzymes.	9.283468057827625
So that is one of the probably simplest configurations that are possible to carry out an enzyme catalyzed reaction.	7.073071423357448
So , we can determine titrometrically or spectroscopically these group polyamides nh 2, cooh groups or polyurethane.	8.671236055066412
That means the f is equal to c / c.	7.132431314505244
They are retained in the reactor system.	5.630987736695548
So , if i write the 12 is reacting with 12 dimer 1 is remaining which means that you had 12 tetramers plus 1 dimer left which makes it on average 12.5 tetramers , 12 tetramer plus 1 dimer which resulting at on average is 12.5 dimer.	9.122875142348777
So , negative means electronic rich.	9.407919407669866
Recently , evaporative mass is detector is getting popularity where the polymer solutions are evaporated and the scattering from the polymer globules are measured; and we can also interrogative spectrometer , but it is not very common.	11.651188112026919
So , we should be careful in using very high molecular weight in determining very high molecular weight in gpc.	8.981838199524919
Now , to start the discussion on molecular weight , we defined a term called kinetic chain length nu , which is which is the number of monomers polymerized per each radicals , that initiated the polymer chain.	8.556676709140564
These expressions have been obtained analytically in the case of different particle size like in the case of thin films and for spheres.	11.000008369909233
I also will cover copolymerization specially the kinetics of free radical copolymerization , and then i will also cover other important polymerization techniques such as ring opening polymerization , and coordination polymers.	9.950806426577092
From this then you can write down rate of reaction as equal to v = k3 [ eab ] if you look at the original rate expression the product is being formed.	9.978257413738225
Now , lets us discuss more about r 1 and r 2; as we define r 1 given by k 1 1 by k 1 2, and r 2 is given by k 2 2 and k 2 .	9.35640256707667
Not all the collisions result into product.	9.053284519200151
But if you take a little more realistic case that instead of having one amino acid residue , we have two amino acid residues or two ionisable residues there might be more than two other amino acid residues which are involved in the active site but they may be non - polar.	10.890780714043299
It serves two purposes; one is that it provides strength to the enzyme sheet.	12.1727964618881
So , let us go back and talk more about the calibration.	5.880438765122347
In the case of activation energy and optimum temperature i mentioned that different systems have shown different kinds of behavior.	8.252174242532146
So , again the strain of you know thermodynamic feasibility will decrease as you increase from c to c and then again go up if you increase the ring size.	8.173322788360219
A particular class of inhibitor gives you a typical effect on the value of km or vm.	10.829977642451299
So , again , one more time let me emphasize , that if you , every temperature , every , your reaction , you can choose any temperature of your reaction and consider that as a ceiling temperature.	8.903236273072896
No , if i have to , if this branch has to react with any other chain , any other polymer chain , then it has to find b group , which it can react , but there is not any polymer chain having free b group at the end , which means , that it cannot undergo reaction with another chain , which means , in this case there would not be any cross - linking between two polymer chain.	10.403990520619963
But , when you impact , apply a hammer on that , you are applying the stress in a much faster rate so , a strain in the material at the very faster rate and the material performs poorly , the glass perform poorly.	11.655334955004264
Let us now discuss the effect of steric effect.	9.560083777623362
They might be some kind of deviation from the ideality because of the packing characteristics or some channeling taking place or in laboratory you can very easily maintain a good plug flow reactor.	9.899779035606008
I would like to make it very clear the phrase , presence or absence of solid support . while initially the enzyme molecules are interlinked through a bifunctional reagent between some of the functional residues on the enzyme protein itself , the method produces a three dimensional cross linked enzyme aggregate.	10.126793243219476
This has the t g 73 minus 73 degree centigrade and this is minus 20 degree centigrade.	11.02377138874026
So , by using these three strategies you can actually minimize this side reaction from methyl methacrylate and carry out addition anionic polymerization for methyl methacrylate and this similar sort of strategy can be applied for other polar monomers as well.	9.006505824181213
We will discuss lecture on living radical polymerization; and we will talk about three different type of living radical polymerization , atrp , sfrp and raft.	9.553385853799528
Similarly galactose oxidase also is in the same concept but in practice these enzymes are not so highly specific.	12.120331462318022
A redox initiator is , rate of initiator is , k d , concentration of reductant oxidant.	12.172426070453524
What is the reaction we are looking at.	8.91307241789052
So , a polymer formed by coupling of two kinetic chains will have two initiator residues whereas , if this undergo disproportion and form two different polymer chain , then each polymer will have one initiator residues.	9.022564458685578
Del s is basically difference between your translational , rotational and vibrational entropy of monomer and polymer.	10.425572241390771
S . i think all of you should be familiar that conventionally in biochemical systems we are used to use these terms with prime and i am sure that you must have understood the meaning of prime for the thermodynamic parameters in biochemical system.	10.530213933836366
That means both the substrates are in large quantity and they are able to saturate the enzyme which in concentration terms is much , much smaller than the a or b.	8.692195836809198
And this case presence of electron withdrawing c n group this will be more stabilized.	11.125064486697394
Let us come to the last very end of this course , i just want to make few concluding remark.	10.856499032894444
That means how do you prepare; what are the reaction conditions.	12.866320557352543
The substrate might reach at the centre of the particle and all the particle is interacting with the substrate.	8.174286313217578
Because the polymer can change the conformation and as of the energy , now polycarbonate having lowest stiffness given by this number , so polycarbonate should be as you explains much much more impact resistance polymer compared to say pmma or polystyrene , and which is a fact among pmma , among pmma polystyrene pc , polycarbonate has much more impact resistant property than the other two polymers.	10.363558283297259
In the first profile there is no peroxidase added which means as soon as the reaction starts the hydrogen peroxide produced inactivates the alcohol dehydrogenase and no further reaction takes place.	9.393707589021556
This step one and step three are where m 1 is getting consumed , and getting incorporated in the chain; see we will write k 1 1 m 1 star m 1 plus k 2 1 m 2 star m 1, and 1 2 plus k 2 2 into star into.	10.038196417913861
Most of the reactions that lead to such kind of inhibition patterns have been then concluded to follow one or the other ordered or ternary complex mechanism formation.	9.019855986703933
Today a large variety of developments that have taken place in the area of biotechnology in general and enzymes in particular can be attributed to the use of a number of physical techniques which have made us to understand a variety of systems and develop and improve upon them for various applications and physics becomes a very important component to understand the enzyme role.	10.834420952667214
So , s for the branch , you know radius of gyration for the branch will be lower than the linear for same molecular weight , so this g would be lower than , so if you can calculate these two , you can get the extent of branching , the lower is the value of g , the higher is the extent of branching.	10.017170277109091
And in other case normal linear poly condensation case you have dimmer , trimer , tetramer and it go slowly one after one , but in this case the monomers comes by diffusion to the interface reacts with the chain end.	8.573709028847764
Therefore the relative rate of diffusion and the relative rate of biochemical reaction are the other features which control the effectiveness factor.	8.15791149834564
So , total molecules at the beginning at t is equal to 0 or n 0 which is n 0 is n a by 2 number of aa molecules plus number of bb molecules n a bar r 1 by 2, which gives plus 1 by r.	7.866477300997398
The total charge inside the carrier particle or around enzyme where the catalysis is going to take place will be different than in the bulk.	10.373658244689508
But del h value will change as we were discussing in last lecture and that will depend upon the amount of stabilization which could be due to resonance or inductive effective or by hyper conservation or by the inter monomer complexes.	10.529394720394132
The other techniques in very briefly thermo forming where , sheets is first extruded and then , it is heated to a temperature just below the , just heated to the softening temperature then , vacuum is applied.	10.802218138982639
In fact most of the products for example the beverages particularly pepsi and coke they are based on glucose fructose syrup; they don t use sucrose as a sweetener because of the use of glucose and fructose syrup in their parent countries their processes need glucose and fructose syrup.	10.536188666120236
So , if i write on the , complete this sentence , in that you can able to do , stabilize both cationic and anionic propagating species.	8.534697233379834
Now , how does it propagate , this can react with either of these two carbon , in terms of possibilities , so if its react with this , then it forms.	10.322756825974738
We are trying to broaden the specificity through protein engineering methods.	8.787622110263282
Example , this was the basis of choosing or designing fire retardants now , we talk about few additives , which work by one of these mechanisms.	12.915416366423145
Elongation is where , polymers win over metals , the polymers can elongate in case of a elongation typically , polymers elongate much more than the metals.	12.871798803703228
So , i consider a solution which corresponds to this particular pie .	9.417992367744096
Here , in case of flexible or bending testing is basically bending mode where , the stress applied.	10.988043250912058
So , anything , anything , which stabilizes this energy , the monomer energy will decrease the difference and over anything , which actually increases the energy of the polymer , the produce or resulting polymer , it also will reduce your magnitude of del h.	9.917672195840622
In a lots of governments are banning plastics , plastic bags mainly because the waste it generates are not degradeable and so , basically , they creates lots of environmental hazards.	10.40791227407717
As i mentioned earlier the degree of inhibition is defined as i = v0 - vi / vo where i is the degree of inhibition and v0 and vi are the enzyme reaction rate at concentration of inhibitor at zero and at some particular concentration i for the enzyme reaction.	8.500623342067835
If you do a higher reaction at higher temperature then equilibrium concentration comes goes up that means your polymerization reaction stop at a higher free monomer concentration.	8.83813768505793
So , the linear formation will be rate of polymerization will be higher.	6.670016191327603
So , this is for a purely statistically random copolymer which is the case for in this case , so this is how we can use nmr , we can get the information about the randomness and the blockiness in this.	8.247014099066984
Look at the data on the activation energy of various immobilized aminoacylases.	12.357031686684401
In practice a well insulated immobilized enzyme column is used.	8.846470268618033
In dilute polymer solution we had found that the excess contribution excess chemical potential , we got this relationship.	10.109772355882095
That means you can use them continuously over a very long period of time and we must also look at how the reactor type influences the operational stability.	8.198525945393214
But in practice the reaction does take place in a living cell as shown in the second half.	8.221429268720035
This conformation is result of not only covalent interactions but of a large number of non covalent interactions which can be disturbed very easily and that is why the deactivation of enzymes can occur and deactivation from industrial point of view is some kind of a loss.	9.84375581859933
Then you have inversion of sucrose a very typical illustrative example from the point of view of india.	8.923847817139173
Two functional groups , so number of functional group reacted , groups reacted is twice n 0 by n.	8.47512966530388
The third and probably , from the operational point of view , very important is stability because we must be able to use the same immobilized enzyme coating for a number of samples so that it is stable over a long period of time plus reproducible.	9.744233840393873
Such a situation can be conceived as a simplification of michaelis menten system.	10.69829476361642
For example if you are going to immobilize this enzyme you can introduce a kind of a hydrocarbon chain before it is really coupled to the enzyme molecule.	7.9495637724287285
On the other hand when we are starting with a monomer unit which is water soluble , then to get water insoluble gel you include a cross linking agent.	8.187382510157846
So 1 - f2 is the dead zone and therefore if you integrate this equation you will get c / c0 = exp ( - f1qt / f2v ) this can be combined with the outflow stirred equation that means the mass balance equation.	10.799484420801749
So , you want the polymer material to be behave as barrier to that perfume whatever is there inside.	8.829776915774278
And then we would move to a new topic on frictional properties of polymer molecules in dilute solution , which basically talks about mainly the viscosity of polymer solution.	8.50247291144572
Therefore only small molecular weight substrate and products can be processed while the large molecular weight substrate or products cannot be processed using entrapped immobilized enzyme preparations.	9.849433187449689
If you replot the modified intercept as a function of inhibitor concentration it will give you a ki and therefore value of a can be determined.	8.473222297533843
Now , how do you achieve the condition where you let all the polymers , all the chains react for the same duration.	9.350659953956777
So , the more amount of incident reflected light.	7.335168688642191
So the product of this kappa is this.	7.804166220325895
Bulk of the bi - substrate reactions do fall in the category of either oxidoreductases or transferases or lipases.	9.182637439316148
Now , let us move to the next topic which is gel permeation chromatography , gpc.	5.637985939911152
So , this is dimer.	6.399386577113132
So , this is in your hand.	5.652260464853128
The most absolute specificity in terms of an enzyme , with which some of you may be familiar , is oxidation of - d - glucose to glucono lactone by glucose oxidase a fungal enzyme which is produced by aspergillus niger.	10.267205773905939
Now , if i have one kinetic chain like this , the one end , this end you have a one initiator residue , which initiated the chain.	9.258736633341636
And prevent that chemicals reaction , which basically produces , basically it stops or prevents this thermo oxidation process is , which we generates this volatile or flammable , volatile flammable volatile organic compounds.	11.71234936527433
Or other sense , m 2, if you talk about reverse way , m 2 will be more reactive , towards both m star and m 1 star , which means that the rate , relative rates at which , two monomers incorporative in the co polymer chains , are the same , irrespective of the identity , of the unit , which is present at the end of propagating species.	9.926917704080548
I think the issue of economics is very , very important in their use in the process industries.	8.193866874052269
So , if i know if i know x n and x n is given by b nu so from experiment if i know the molecular weight above sample , if i know the molecular weight and total total amount total gram , then we know number of chains as well.	9.966954090574687
You can have a general representation of the backbone structure like this , where z represents any of the functional groups we talked about and any polymer which does not have this structure , we call them as addition reaction.	9.9501656788491
Again this is another contemporary , very important topic for a polymer researcher that , what happened after.	12.978020249763963
That is your space time that was defined in the earlier expressions.	10.214780005172797
So within a limited ph range at which the right kind of amino acid residues are ionized the native confirmation of the protein is maintained.	10.96481970696078
It is increased by a factor 1 + i / ki.	5.713853790327011
Of the two major modifications of that which have been proposed and have been used in the enzyme catalyzed reaction , one is a hollow fiber reactor.	9.915349416951129
Km k2 e + s e s e + p + i ki ei then the same free enzyme molecule binds to the inhibitor and gives you ei.	9.26154433504278
Then we see the effect on lineweaver burk plot.	10.371414804491591
So , in case of 12 so 12 multiplied by 4 plus 1 dimer 1 plus 2 divided by 12 number of molecules that is 1.	10.260327422396308
So , this byproduct as the byproduct hcl is not taking part in the reverse reaction , so this reaction is kinetically controlled.	8.01035163138343
This is an enzyme reactor , a plug flow reactor and then consider the central axis , the velocity profile of the feed.	7.945823380119034
Now this r we said it is proportional to the radius of gyration.	6.47222807639859
So , equilibrium constant how it is achieved.	9.853243821959287
H - t.	8.840850777355998
Remember , we talked about while discussing with tg , glass condition temperature , we discussed that this miscible polymer blend has single tg.	9.941456036130166
So , we can write , similarly activation energy for reaction e i , initiation , plus e propagation minus termination and e x n bar 0 in absence of any chain transfer rate reagent we can write this.	7.9532049268129805
Most of the chemical modification reagents that are used for modification of the enzyme active sites do play a role in the irreversible inhibition.	9.658332863944153
So , it is tg is drops down as long as reaction temperature is below above t g of the polymer in that condition the chains or mobility.	9.778460364073227
In one there is no actual dispersion; in the other case there is complete back mixing.	11.503053497907416
In this case this is the unit which is repeated which means and this is called , this is the repeat unit for polystyrene case.	9.779739957302105
On the other hand look at similar reactions which are of commercial value and in large quantity.	6.535506678814596
Then there is no reason why they will be dead at the end of the polymerization , so they will be still be live at the end of the polymerization , so you can use this and make the block copolymers.	8.393524849115952
How this , how the polymer industry works.	11.827841002412203
Therefore it will be interesting to note how they catalyze the reactions such that these properties are built in , in the system.	8.78387293862685
For the two enzymes to act , in the early phases when substrate concentration increases from zero to three arbitrary units whatever are the units , in the case of sigmoidal kinetics the reaction velocity is only 0.1 in some arbitrary units.	10.782181253107916
Now as reaction goes with more and more m 1 is getting incorporated , now first a rate then m .	9.147764139000246
The specificity of this method is based on co - ordination complex formation with the peptide bond which is a unique property or a basic property in all proteins.	9.78943835905475
So this type of monomer , which contain this side of , there is a carbonic carbonyl group here , they can easily undergo anionic polymerization , they can undergo radical polymerization.	10.473444338103945
Electron donors , like lewis acids are added to increase the reactivity and the specificity stereo specificity of the catalyst.	10.631758665079586
Even in case of ab type of monomer also , you can also have cyclization at an intermediate step.	12.030640237364025
So , total number of functional groups remaining unreacted is sum of these two.	5.932763716353643
So , this is a very slow reaction , if you do the reaction in this way this will give you a very slow reaction.	7.483100291492959
And , this degradation of molecular happens faster in outdoor conditions , because it has exposed to the uv light , much more extent than indoor conditions.	9.6220940693902
With increasing external energy , external magnetic field , the energy between the two state increases , and with increasing in the difference between the two energy states , the population is in the lower state which is ground state , becomes more and more compared to the higher states.	11.000216994553812
So best is to initially look at those enzymes which are available in large quantities and one can only diversify their application to a large range of non - natural reactions which are of commercial value and this will require very clear understanding of their reaction mechanism because presently those reactions are being carried out by chemical transformations and making use of the reaction mechanism one can probably think of certain unconventional reactions.	10.34505663963869
So , the more shielded it has higher delta , lower delta h value , and if it is deshielded , then it is a higher delta h value , now this probably known to you , so i am not spending too much time on this.	9.719198280416176
So , from the value of tau s we know k p by k t this is known this is known , so this by this as to be unknown this is unknown.	8.623263025200178
A variety of reactor types can be used for carrying out the transformation or reactions instead of using only a batch stirred reactor as we can afford only for a soluble enzyme.	8.872464258876816
So , it cannot be done at room temperature.	6.1034811758218765
The idea of un - competitive inhibition has been very , very useful in understanding the reaction mechanism for bi substrate reactions.	9.625117667955932
Let us consider reaction adipic acid plus diethylene glycol at 190 degree centigrade in presence of 0.4 mol percent of para toluene sulphonic acid as a catalyst and the product is polyester plus h 2 o.	9.455179130787045
Obviously , for these ionic , this also may depend on the solvent polarity and the counter and so on.	8.186651794025401
Similarly , in this case , this can again reinitiate a cationic polymerization.	6.331660238895592
That means after swelling what is the swelling behavior of the particle and the compression behavior in the columns and abrasion.	11.074415491091155
This is k1, k - 1, k2 and k.	6.3364227590672
These are the two molecular strategies which are responsible for the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.	6.894738292355254
Like in our case we had reverse sleeve which is covered over the tip of the electrode so that the film remains intact on the electrode and it is separate because being inserted in the dialysis bed , it is separated from the ptfe membrane also and it also provides the analytical molecule to permeate through it and come in proximity with the enzyme.	10.737110177015392
The quantification methods could be classified into two categories mainly or the two constituents could form the basis of assay methods.	10.783339633256258
So you will have a difference in , the monomers concentration in the copolymer , compared to feed.	11.444928467567594
That means equilibrium constant is the one where the rate of forward reaction and the backward reaction are identical and the equilibrium constant the value of the concentration of product upon substrate at v = 0 will be keq = [ p ] eq / [ s ] eq = k1 k2 / k - 1 k - 2 or in terms of the basic kinetic parameters keq = [ p ] eq / [ s ] eq = k1 k2 / k - 1 k - 2 = vs . kp / ks . vp the expression can be arrived from the main rate expression which will give you the equilibrium constant either in terms of the rate constant.	7.976753365090786
This is the fraction.	5.756387740498545
For example if we consider these polyesters , when r is c h 2 4, c h 2 4 is linear alkane.	10.51153657341499
Now , suspension polymerization as we talked about in last lecture that it is a heterogeneous polymerization , where you have monomer and monomer soluble initiator , and you have aqueous medium , and dispersions which actually absorbed on the monomer droplets.	10.160357868432623
So , direct aligcot can be taken at different time m and the polymer can be fastigiated out from the reaction; second you can directly measure the concentration either by spectroscopic technique or any chemical techniques.	10.583626549405848
So , they cannot be molten , you know melted by heating.	9.307212831233127
The basic property of this reversible interaction also makes it a weak binding.	9.50578028308988
The free energy change will be equal to.	8.783777765952472
So , energetic , we will consider this generic initiation step and also consider this initiation step , of , for the discussion because this is the most important of the initiation step we just discussed.	10.35644845439765
You have a whole range of small applications in different sectors probably the most prominent among the miscellaneous groups i will like to place is biological treatment.	10.197768340605917
Now , because all these , there are 3 different type of effectives.	10.440146577195586
And specially look for the chain stoppers which are mono functional molecules , if you find them which means it is as a result of degradation or a side reaction there would be either imbalance in the stoichiometry.	11.504524403223396
Now , you can have situations like r 1 greater than 1, r 2 less than 1 or vice versa , or r 1 less than 1 or closer than 1, r 1 greater than 1, r 2 greater than .	7.145499790529732
So , basically , these are the attributes , surface active additives must have to be successful in any application.	8.42857531796388
But the drop in initiator concentration is much more compared to drop in monomer concentration.	6.856835383299871
Kf is equal to a pseudo first order rate constant for enzyme catalyzed reaction which is k 2e0 / k m.	9.750995061848007
So , basically first order transitions gives continuity in g verses t , p , v plot , whereas the first derivative of g is discontinuous when we plot against these state parameters.	8.886412380973308
What does additives do.	10.376437632439035
I just quickly go through that.	9.116297075699382
Now if , for example , what we were doing yesterday that i discussed that if i for example , have two phenol; bisphenol in this case and now they may react with some carbonate source to make to form polycarbonate.	12.134182246445441
Usually in any enzyme catalyzed reaction , the concentration of enzyme will be of the order of few milli molar or even lesser than that.	9.5267142797036
That means after the addition of the inhibitor to an enzyme substrate mixture one can physically remove it.	9.297598215547408
So , weight fraction is given by this number , this expression whereas , number of fraction was given by this was n 0 here how a plot will look like if a plot here.	10.0622161780762
But there is , there is the special case at the end of the reaction , if the monomer concentrating i , which we will talk about in the later lecture.	9.6478928275382
L which was established parameters for diffusional limitations.	9.69739817776874
So , this end does not have any reactive functional group.	6.391537654684635
Now , i have; so , for this class i have 50 students , 50 students on an average age , let us , 25 years , all of you.	9.950732185090587
In this case they are not branched; they are linear high molecular polyethylene and that can be achieved even at low temperature , which is very means achievable or very comfortable temperature 50 degree to 100 degree centigrade , and even normal to low temperature , low pressure.	9.606314773797692
And today basically , we will continue our discussion; we had started on gel permeation chromatography or size exclusion chromatography and then briefly discussed mass spectroscopy of polymers in particularly maldi tof ms.	10.412899364157422
Here some of the cross linkages are shown ending with the dots.	13.509717951396725
As you notice here the native invertase has the optimum temperature of 55c and by immobilized preparation by different methods or like physical adsorption on activated carbon is 40c , ionic binding to deae cellulose is 30c which is a very significant change.	9.676622224865309
Now , let us talk about the thermodynamics of this glass transition temperature and the melting point in brief.	6.297382425555503
They are partially crystalline this peek and pek poly ether ether ketone and polyether ketone they are partially crystalline polymers they have a t g around this range and they have a very high melting point.	9.446257850060126
This enzyme falls into the category of proteins and the course will cover various aspects of enzymes , particularly in relation to their application as a biocatalyst in the process industries.	9.264871668632761
So , in this case ethylene oxide you must put a bracket that the monomer inside the bracket and then prefix the term poly.	8.364001087995367
Now , it is very difficult.	4.662683350549509
And if you have pendent polar troops , then it effects , or if a pendent polar group obviously , the inter molecular attraction goes up , and as a result t m will go up.	9.069145426924933
In , especially in polymer chemistry course , we must know what are the factors that responsible or that affects the value of t g.	9.704231029292707
Ea is hypothetical in the sense it may not be a binary complex.	11.857876829819501
The same bond which is available in the protein molecules and a very simple reaction.	9.671552866583298
So , once we know that with the help of the software this things can be easily calculated.	9.431824538877354
So , this is the number way and all the polymers can be placed.	7.58205954147076
Now , this can react with 1 mole of same molecules , let us , this is another possibility where sodium can react with naphthalene by electron transfer , you can generate anionic species , which can initiate it , can react with the monomer to initiate the chains.	10.155408963661703
At least four major methods are used for adsorption.	10.678539763190134
And with further drop in temperature , their mobility becomes effectively very low and they become a glassy state.	9.162579747971147
Gel entrapment was cheaper than sephadex but when you look into the operational advantage you will notice that even expensive carrier was desirable and acceptable.	11.106392942151432
If in case the substrate also happens to be a charged molecule , so there will be some partitioning effects of the substrate between the bulk and so the real substrate concentration what we are considering in the bulk phase will not be same at the site of the enzyme reactions.	10.62040022710097
Now , if you look at the data as the ring size increases from 3 to 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 now the ring the lower number ring 3 and 4 member ring , they are quite highly strained 3 4 member are strained because of 1 angle strain if they are having high energy because of 1 angle strain.	8.945826513563492
They have good strength and some of the applications are in rods , safety glasses , indoor and outer lightings and optical fibres.	10.5062802286223
For example , you have styrene where both cationic and anionic can be stabilized by resonance with this aromatic proof or say , cation , resulting cation or anionic can be stabilized by resonance from this double bond.	8.224983419456871
That is another basic expression of kinetic behavior in the case of enzyme catalyzed reaction.	6.577406204845439
Now , it can be easily shown to have this expression; let me show that.	7.794920806191049
Now , from the first reaction , this one , we can write a equilibrium constant k 1 by k 2, is this 1 by concentration of cooh and ha; from this reaction , we can write equilibrium constant is this; concentration of this , divided by the concentration of this , and concentration of that.	10.343237518857604
Now , let us , we have to consider or we have to find what the number of fraction is or say probability of finding a chain with x mar x structure units.	8.865711467849813
Finally the operational stability of the system as a result of or the effect of the enzyme deactivation during the continuous operation of the two different types of reactor will also be influenced by the deactivation pattern and one cannot decide absolutely whether a cstr is desirable or pfr is desirable.	11.8917675983798
No , it is not fixed because there are continuous rotation across the single bond.	9.193782911223405
So , if i write from this the expression for r 1 which is given by k 1e 1 by k 1 2 i should write.	8.127514484246387
So , typically the water soluble monomers are reported relative to polyethylene oxides standards.	9.156221462676527
The very characteristic feature of enzyme is their specificity.	8.63643926771088
That means for example if you are using glucose as a substrate for a particular reaction , then the cell should not contain the enzymes that can also act on glucose and produce the side effects.	9.508861607913387
In case of a single chain enzyme the quaternary structure question doesn t arise but possible in the case of a multimeric enzyme or what we call as oligomeric enzyme.	8.932998421352838
So , we are talking about reaction between di hydroxyl and di di - hydroxyl compound and indus intermediare stages.	7.559854079671389
So , it is a average number of monomers which polymerize per radical; per radical , which actually polymerize , which actually initiate the polymerization; not the , as we said that some of the radicals get , you know , consumed by side reactions , or some other reactions , we do not initiate polymer chain.	9.540143153370533
Now , this obviously , this shows that the , this is for o methoxy group o methoxy group , and this peaks up for alpha methyl group this one and these two protons are given by here , now , this alpha , the protons from alpha methyl groups they will have different chemical shift , depending upon the special arrangement of the next carbon for example , if the next carbon here this particular one , if we draw this in explain little bit here.	10.93913422870145
In one of the last lectures or previous lectures , so in the synthesis of polycarbonate form , this phenol , a using phosgene.	11.433145120629339
In the box , in an expanded view of the column in which the microcapsule contains the enzyme and the ion exchange resin the reaction takes place; urea gets converted into carbon dioxide and ammonia.	10.734193178276785
So , critical composition at which the polymer started , starts a separating out from solution is given by 1 by 1 plus x , x is the number of segments , chain segments which is always very high , x is always much , much greater than .	9.036859999576706
This is the structure we have been showing you many times , these are several ways you can see synthesis pet poly esters terephthalate , you can do take a ethylene ethylene glycol and diacid terephthalate acid.	11.408081342242127
And finally , it is cooled here and the part is taken out , it is used mainly for bottles , hallow materials like bottles and similar materials.	11.192890313901914
So , higher the conversion the higher the molecular weight.	6.189777868409589
This propagation has to be much lower compared to initiation first of all and if that happen or if that has to happen , then all these polymers should be live.	10.996639106342299
The answer is no because the fact that the glass transition temperature depends upon also the rate at which we cool the polymer matrix or polymer melt.	9.221644880236365
The terminologies i mentioned in last slide , last page where these polymer chains are networked.	11.9261902210481
Many of the immobilized penicillin acylase system have been produced wide vied and marketed.	11.34235056241423
In this case , because of this , rate comes down and because of this , molecular weight has large drop.	8.945834436513096
After this point , it is m 1 is getting incorporated in a slower rate.	10.23134243562459
Where from this phenol comes from.	10.444030370235497
So , generally we actually consider engineering stress and engineering strain all the time.	8.710614761324747
Normal alkane , which gives us very flexible chain , and t g t m is 50 degree centigrade , if you increase much stiffer molecule group.	12.087364380813563
Similarly in case of rubber , a similar behavior , and in case of above very high temperature is like a polymer melt , it does not recover at all , and it continually gets deformed as long as stress is present , so you get a complete viscous behavior.	11.298502506675986
And typically membranes are supplied in a in a wet conditions in a particular solvent like isopropanol.	10.790402642361988
This is put into a trough containing toluene.	9.798690062388372
So , k p is constant throughout this process.	7.472112010947917
If i give you a structure of the of the polymer synthetic polymer , then you should be able to identify by which process it has been synthesized , whether it is a step polymers polymerization process or a chain polymerization process.	9.63948272935787
So , where in the applications , where you require very high loading high loading applications where basically , the part has to hold a very high load.	10.335117577374419
But there can be more than one processes undergoing here and thereby the binding process can provide you a large fraction of the activated energy to be compensated during binding process and reducing the energy of activation.	8.706891099581329
So , it is also low density.	6.588632881936181
The typical example is cellulose.	8.516767073032735
But , these are the some examples , i am keeping on; there could be many many more examples of this type of additives , but this is just for your knowledge that these are the possible way of using additives , and how they actually do their job; for example , primary anti oxidants by trapping the radicals , and these by increasing the termination reaction.	10.090305870329884
At least it is understood that as proposed by oxten that the enzyme active site also must have at least three different functional residues on the active site which can interact with the substrate molecule.	8.612977814956045
There are four adsorption methods which are based mostly on ionic binding because most of the cells have negative charge on the surface and therefore any positively charged matrix can be used to adsorb the cells on to the surface.	9.201257588542877
Now , if you increase the temperature it will be the same reaction with butyl lithium in t h f.	8.524647081686021
You get a completely different pattern and as you recall that when we discussed the inhibition patterns we also mentioned very clearly that major use of the inhibition patterns is in the analyses of the bi - substrate reactions to identify their reaction mechanism.	9.813718347706661
So , that is 600 by 4 1.5 so that is nu is.	7.93216426072192
Now , you can initiate a polymer chain and at the end you can terminate the chain and then by acid hydrolysis you can make a interminated polymer.	9.276197788452427
It shows the effect of shift from zero order to first order.	8.815885007622201
But the basic characteristics of plug flow reactor is that the substrate inlet stream moves do they flat concentration profile or velocity profile along the length of a reactor.	10.96481255348341
Now , we will start with our discussion on constitutional or structural isomers and then going to polymerization of conjugated dienes which will give some insight about geometric isomerization of polymers.	8.158161657681964
A very extreme situation can be considered of immobilization where we are not really having a physical preparation in the immobilized form but if you use a soluble enzyme in a membrane reactor , a typical membrane reactor , and this is a ultra filtration reactor in which the enzyme molecules are put in and this membrane is able to restrict the flow of enzyme and you can put in the substrate here , the product can go out and the enzyme can be retained in the membrane reactor.	10.70626492611728
We get this pet bottles they are this , they are made of this polyethylene terephthalate.	10.94654977209191
In this case also , we have to include both these.	8.755588398531296
Now , the number of monomers will decrease as the conversion goes up , but even at very high concentration , there are significant numbers of monomers present in the reaction.	8.693712947318506
So , to take out the mineral molecule , you have to make the viscosity lower.	8.151393430789039
The activation energy behaviour was almost similar as in the case of low substrate and at high.	10.055234910520525
I will come to that later.	6.727715247538975
The solution of this differential equation is usually expressed in the form of thiele modulus and a large number of workers have given the solution of this expression both for zero as well as the first order reactions for which the analytical solution can be easily obtained.	9.85160737496074
They are always present in the cyclic formation.	9.442085520486161
In other words the concept is very simple and a large variety of biological units have been used to prepare biosensors.	10.522314677101184
So , we know the value of f k d this known now this is known this is known , so you know this is for thermal thermal polymerization.	8.625985910676087
We store enzyme in the presence of substrate at low temperatures so that reaction rate is stopped during storage.	11.172407000415884
Not this one.	9.618088405068622
There are some smaller industries which make custom polymer products.	8.564685380438801
One is e , the enzyme does not take part in reaction , an uncatalyzed reaction and it goes to e plus p.	7.62420874240145
In case of many of the ligases the situation may be bi - uni.	10.734376816083824
So , what is the modification done to get the mass spectroscopy polymers; one soft ionization mechanism is used where will come in a minute using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization or maldi by which the polymers are vaporized with the help of a matrix without degradation and we also use the second technique called time of flight mass spectroscopy; and in combination of these two techniques we get maldi tof ms matrix assisted laser desorption ionization , time of flight mass spectroscopy which is nowadays very important or very common for polymer samples.	9.234822245467864
So , our discussion in our discussion , we will be mainly focusing on this external catalyzed reaction and we will not discuss too much about the self catalyzed reaction.	10.200114250936636
So , you may have a branching here so if transfer happen within polymer , you get branching.	9.287054678135588
That is r is a gas constant , t is absolute temperature , n is the avogadro s number and h is the planck s constant.	8.671445137120843
So , actually what we plot is delta s by c versus c; delta t s is the steady state temperature difference as steady state which again is measured by the difference in the resistance between the two thermistors versus c.	9.864080355982125
So , every surfactant , every micelle which are present , they all active micelle or they have already turned into the polymer particle surrounded by the surfactant molecules.	8.958155685157712
Any deviation from the minimum energy level will lead to its denaturation or inactivation of the catalytic function of the enzyme sample.	10.885246286036312
So , from 98, conversion going to 99 percent conversion , we have to almost double the reaction type , some 450 to 85.	11.218623605171231
At the time of michaelis and menten , there was no proposal of michaelis and menten constant.	7.569865140608014
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in this lecture , this is lecture 1.	5.855935829009125
Now , in case of radical polymerization how do we define radical polymerization how do you define the x n is the total total number of monomers reacted , i hope it is all visible this is not very sharpen , by total number of polymer molecules.	8.270867538053626
Elongational break decreases with increasing molecular weight and elongational break decreases with increases short change branching density of the polymer.	9.937134044259025
Now , from these students , now i take out two student and add 2, 10 year students; we have age of 10 years , class standard 10, student , 5 student.	9.64936860181496
So you can arrange , you can place or you can locate the first segment in any of these vacant cells.	10.18317506186717
And we planned to just complete the discussion , we were having on phase separation behavior of polymer solutions.	8.051061126536537
Now , in the topics we have completed our discussion shape and size of polymer chains , and then you also completed deducing an expression for understanding expression for freely rotating chain.	9.076945475098062
This has this , the propagating anion from cyanoacylate is highly stabilized , so you can actually anionically polymerize these cyanoacylate monomers with a weekly , very weak nucleophiles.	10.235116024719456
The second binding process is represented by dissociation constant of a ks either here or here.	8.685882263402373
They gave a classification system which is acceptable globally today and it classifies all the enzymes into six major classes : oxidoreductases , transferases , hydrolases , lyases , isomerases and ligases.	10.555587896587038
So , for , if you compare with defined , different metal is basically atomic number.	8.117347833819734
And , these sides serve as chlorine radical source , which basically initiate the degradation.	9.56138611769205
It will imply or it will also be a very logical conclusion that the faster reactions , if the reaction has to go very fast rate , then they must have larger value of k *.	10.046951543507868
That provides you a very big advantage of removing the steric hindrance.	9.262440002871895
What we will do now we will move to the next polymerization method , which is a ring opening polymerization or in short r o p.	8.43327544769631
Kf; sb / j = 1 / kl + 1 /.	10.210587531155545
In minority of application this polymers are taken and added to other ingredients like the examples i gave in detergents , but in major cases the polymer is mixed with the other ingredients like additives , pigments , stabilizers and it is by a process called polymer processing , compounding and you , it is transformed with granules or flakes or pellets to form intermediate product.	11.162723156025182
This v can be considered as the observed reaction rate which has been monitored experimentally and therefore one can determine the magnitude of sb - ss and that determines whether the diffusional control is there or not and accordingly one can design the reactor.	9.491029759362537
So , by converging you get t c , and so you can write at that point at t c both are zero , this way you can get this.	9.57270648645073
Now instead of r , we are writing a propagating chain because that is the that is the steps get repeated.	13.267755528184187
So , what for this type of initiation.	8.555907066348661
What you have.	10.984261722736267
So , here you first make a step polymers , by step polymerization mechanism you make a unsaturated polyester , and then by doing a chain reaction you can do a cross linking reaction to form a cross linking reaction.	10.16688055536521
The cheap cd s are manufactured by compact divisional.	12.220132761876407
Next terms we be discussion about reflection and gloss; reflect reflectivity is defined as the ratio of the intensity of reflected light , to the incident light.	10.140023377172305
Both are related to biochemical reaction.	8.962864175249887
So this is adsorption that is transport and enzyme catalyses enzyme substrate binding.	7.664695652312232
Now , this if you this is a longer longer chain , so obviously , you can ignore this four aromatic compounds compare to the number of aromatic protons present in the styrene.	11.552730334035456
Based on this i think one of the major studies which were reported in seventies was particularly on the mass transfer in immobilized enzyme reactor by rovito and kitrell.	10.48702101545464
We had convinced our self now with the values of individual rate constant that our assumption was not , not in accurate assumption was accurate.	10.721152294594399
If immobilized enzyme preparation has a small loading the diffusional resistances will not be very controlling.	12.57095011550204
So , if you fix or if you do not change the initiation reaction , the molecular weight again goes up with n p , so with single handle by just increasing n p , you can now increase the molecular weight of the polymer.	8.821010096263594
So , when you talk about you know , but in commonly , in common man whatever they see is applications of polymers , they see in daily life is a plastic , you know applications are visible as a plastics application.	10.20954412676506
That is the reason why your poly dispersity goes up little over because you cannot avoid completely.	8.582745376904159
When you have seen in the books , you have seen me always writing polymers like this , something like this , we never write polymers like this , we never write polymers like this , we always write whenever represent polymer , we write a quily chain.	9.236517654350816
So , they do not take part or contribute too much in the delays value of polymerization , is basically that translational entropy drop for the monomers and which practically does not depend on the monomer structure.	8.85759413727444
Short branch and this is long branch and this is hyper branch.	18.072680005922283
Not a very general behavior.	13.240011327283355
Now , m e you can get , again t is given , t c is given , so that is your temperature reaction.	10.594844241313178
Now , if you look at this two point the tangent for those two point would meet at the same points , which means they have they must have a common tangent.	8.590285137769527
S /.	10.736765270727949
The effectiveness factor for all those system is a function of the thiele modulus in all cases whatever is the order of reaction whether it is first order , zero order or michaelis menten kinetics , the effectiveness factor is always a function of thiele modulus and this function varies basically on the order of reaction as well as on the particle geometry.	10.420276910874165
Three degrees of translational freedom and three rotational for each of the molecule a and b.	10.514487676231113
So , refractive index value for two perpendicularly polarized light , we will have different value.	10.190835525303898
If you look here this is a free soluble enzyme.	8.83859522848926
The one which is larger has to be used.	9.624756166727435
Ke is much , much higher than k , the lower being a catalyzed reaction.	9.10292974572894
So therefore the reaction will always continue in a product inhibited design.	9.744645626566493
But again doing covalent modification of this enzyme , you loose lot of activity and there might be some change in the conformation so as to alter substrate specificity in the process.	9.742506826255108
Almost they will be the size of yeast cells.	14.83932753175807
We will try to get some information , some prediction from statistics.	9.444502706602227
Now , we can also do , and decompose the; first stop this step; we can decompose these by non radical pathways.	9.61394581064024
And you have taken that is one is to one and you are heating with phosgene.	10.042882509210575
So , it is advisable is always done in industrially.	7.811516999509042
And in this case that might go down with could results in the increase in the magnetitude of the del h that is one way to explain the high value of del h of high value of magnetitude of del h in case of trifluoroethylene to poly tetrafluoroethylene tetrafluoroethylene to poly tetrafluoroethylene.	10.926469332279387
The substrate concentration goes down and the reaction rate varies in the pfr along the length of the reactor.	7.680306922213705
And polymeric dielectric used in capacitors , and as a insulators , so basically this are the two main use of polymers , in polymers , in electrical samples.	10.964965225801606
So , basically there will be effectively positive and if you are electron donating group , basically it will be electron rich double bond.	10.065388266629085
The ionization of substrate will influence the km value of the enzyme.	7.237030248063621
That means the enzyme can bind either to inhibitor or to a substrate and kes and kei will have definite magnitude but the kesi either will be infinity and that is the typical case of a competitive inhibitor.	9.132184398116394
If you have monomer like styrene , then what happened if you have a anionic case , i have other resonating structures if you have a cationic , and so as radical.	10.231753404766357
We have only come to the transition state complex and the rate of reaction will depend upon the concentration of ab *.	9.466563319231996
This is the upper limit of this.	6.234938926735548
That means the enzyme molecule which is homogenously suspended in a soluble preparation has to be then localized in a narrow region of space and this is no longer uniformly , homogenously distributed in a reaction mixture.	10.216742318772857
If you look at for a very broad based and operational definition of immobilization we can say that enzymes are physically confined or localized in a defined region of a space.	7.297855698319306
Other examples also like peresters , let us talk about in next page.	8.426433149148204
So , w 1 is 1 and w 2 for the solute is also .	9.47897851479583
The whole effect of ph and temperature therefore is not based on a single interaction like in the case of substrate or an inhibitor which is usually their effect on the reaction rate and the formation of dynamic complexes with the enzyme.	8.824050446096837
Maximum reaction velocity remains the same but the km changes.	13.187262181161993
Yes only inherent kinetic constant and . . . . . when we assume that.	11.13268140711031
So , total in n x in x and in average is the molecular width of the structural units.	8.123182503561527
This is for a small molecule; the solute having a small molecule point scatterer.	8.923251625311051
Now , it can have two types of arrangement where i can have.	7.429874991659839
There are four different enzyme species e , ea , eab and ey.	9.304176714774037
Now , it is the lambda we are using , because what happened if the size of the scatterer or the polymer molecule or the other scatterer is very high and the respective interference between the scattered light from different part of the solute becomes so much that even at a little higher theta , this becomes 0; the value of p theta becomes .	10.189634868022262
Unlike the polymers the chain polymers we have only carbon - carbon backbone , in this case they are different; like in this case you have oxygen next molecule atom and this is ch 2 molecule.	11.099898759468623
Coming first to the application of king altman method i will try to illustrate it with a simple bi intermediate reaction sequence.	10.208519493664125
So , this is only constant if you have same polymer and solvent temperature because if you change either of them v h , the coil dimension will change and your gyration radius of the expansion factor will also change.	9.815695998059773
The what are the preferred conditions you know it should be external catalyzed it should be open driven system where you your systems should have ability to take out the small molecular byproduct as much as possible from the system.	10.024771845548456
We take molecules use or use polymers having molecular weight much above than these , so for practical purposes at the practical range of molecular weight , which usually used for applications of polymers.	9.781192165141464
Similarly in case of enzyme loading we talk of international units per gram of carrier or if you take into account the bulk density of the carrier you can also say international units per ml of carrier bed that means you pack the carrier into a bed , packed bed , and then consider the volume.	10.865236775701993
The arrangement or the organization of the multiple chains could be two chains; there could be three chains or four chains.	10.553413731239473
Homopolymer can have polymers made from two different monomers , say a and b as said in earlier classes , earlier class.	10.813879053538006
Now , after making these pellet they sell it to original equipment manufacturer.	9.36631654031035
A second type of living radical polymer is stable free radical polymerization.	8.215446644035255
So , you have situation something like this.	4.956533055923162
Now , what does it mean it does not mean it all the instruction given to you are incorrect , you have to deep you know look into deep what might have happened.	8.846555073750727
It could also interfere with the binding due to steric hindrances in such a way that the binding of substrate is prevented fully or partially and substrate and the inhibitor are mutually exclusive.	9.476857580767973
We are far from the reality but still as the concept it has probably attracted the attention of many scientists.	9.956155560058148
So , you understand the terminally controlled polymers would give always a statistically random copolymer whether whereas , in kinetically controlled polymerization reaction.	8.165715104439773
So if you increase this pendent group , what happened , it increase the free volume; hence the flexibility goes up , and as a result your t m goes down.	7.708915271268817
So , you get plenty of monomers , 95 percent monomers.	7.451117460008613
For the sake of convenience let us assume that we have to isomerise glucose to fructose with enzyme called glucose isomerase.	8.77744265802218
Now this case , the vacant d - orbital present in the transition metal is the main source of catalytic activity.	7.365586719082197
So , it is a head and tail.	6.504969704671151
These are corresponding to different temperature.	7.9550813905680124
Well i will try to illustrate with a couple of examples which will give you an idea as to why we have been looking at the use of immobilized enzyme compared to either soluble enzyme or chemical catalyst.	10.125567039886056
So , ends are more mobile and have more free volume and hence they has they have more free volume.	8.289635073388295
So , in case of x mar which has one free one , free a group and x minus 1 a group which is reacted to probability of finding such x mar is given by 1 minus p.	7.290950368765456
Let us take a example , you know simple example and see whether we can visualize this more.	8.193291421597438
We talked about general features of all the characteristics of ionic chain polymerization and its comparison with radical polymerization.	7.926070681566336
He always talked of dissociation constant which is a very fundamental parameter in the physical chemistry.	11.973519839090095
They may not be extremely different and therefore it is necessary to look at the actual effect of the bi - substrate reactions on the reaction rate.	8.057247025621518
But these are relative ratio; so the 1.2.	13.601646516496455
So unless we want enzymes with a very high stability particularly when the enzyme cost is very high we don t want to lose them during the reaction and such methods are not preferred.	10.613484682679985
So basically , a good fire retardant polymer should not generate lots of smoke and obiviously they should not produce toxic gases.	10.047346731731485
The principle remains the same as in the case of soluble enzyme but the preparation of the analytical samples becomes very easy because then you don t have to separate the hydrolyzing agents , the catalyst.	7.850475664157222
Similarly , you can write this similar reaction for this aluminum chloride and alkyl halide reaction.	8.829240215815448
In the first case this should be ka.	8.571990670224197
So , the monomer which is present , this should come as a denominator , so that r is always less than equals to .	8.459991487951532
We need to keep in mind , the chemical structure of the polymer when you design a additive.	9.799964257160775
Glucose oxidase 80 kilo joules per mole; hexokinase 27.6 kilo joules per mole; lactate dehydroginase another good system 62.1 and urease with the urea only 6..	11.866115508531943
You can give a generalized structure of metallocene catalyst like this where or you can write a structural l l dash m t x 2; where l l dash are the ligands which can be equal.	10.802616096946148
One is that enzymes have binding sites for substrate molecule.	7.318871376808584
In next lecture what we will talk.	17.413298818010123
So , total number of functional groups unreacted is summation of these two.	5.707958576747127
What you notice is that when you start at zero time the fraction of conversion will keep on going down as the enzyme activity is reduced or lost.	10.343973422791892
We talked about , in the initiation reaction; here , the monomer is getting consumed.	10.036743315450096
So , if you can carry out a polymerization reaction of these monomers at 25 degree centigrade , the reaction will stop or in accurate sense , reaction will be equilibrium till your monomer concentrations comes down to this level.	7.861772001578566
The higher is the load , lower will be the temperature , heat distinction temperature.	10.245328960041066
So , you are a value could be lower 0..	8.76786411218271
We will come to t m and melting point , before coming to melting point discussion , let us just recap with the crystallizing polymer , which we discussed in length last lecture.	9.056526205811899
Today we will be looking at the first application sector where they are used mainly as industrial catalyst.	9.210716919636829
But , for these lecture , we will mainly talk about first two test , which are used very often and rest of the test will not be covered because the , because of lack of time , this will not be covered in this lecture.	10.524933051557584
Glucose is the starting point when we go into the metabolics and its first step is phosporylation of glucose and you get a series of products glucose - 1 - phosphate , glucose - 6 - phosphate or fructose - 1 - phosphate and so on.	8.96956187206988
For example in the case of lock and key mechanism if there are molecules which are similar in conformation they might be able to partly interact with the catalytic site and influence the reaction.	8.381596667846335
If you take a substrate which has low diffusivity in the matrix the problem is more serious because the rate of diffusion is slower than the biochemical reaction rate.	8.43939560192666
That means just by changing concentration ratio of two to three fold you will notice that the reaction velocity can be altered from 0.1 to 0.75 and that is the advantage with this kind of reaction behavior the regulatory enzymes obtained in the case of cellular metabolism with this kind of a kinetic behavior the enzymes are able to act almost like an on and off switch.	10.09576862109268
So , this is a very commonly used polymer as a homo polymer as a as such or as blend with some other homo polymers by polystyrene and polycarbonate and others.	9.103359618721994
Similar types of additives is anti - stat additive or anti - static additive where , additives , which migrate to the surface and being water absorbing.	10.905120784107277
If the polymer chains and entangled , the polymer chains and entangled , then moving fast each other , going fast each other , is become more and more difficult , very difficult because they are entangles , so the viscosity becomes much higher after the entanglement.	10.370340337977526
But at the moment you add little bit of water along with this mix , so you have the same reaction with bf 3 plus h 2 o , then there is a rapid reaction.	9.833330577086649
So there are three criteria say initiators should fulfill; one is that it should be readily available off course , specially for commercial application , it should be readily available , and it should be stable , at amnion condition if you are storing it in amnion condition at room temperature , even if you are storing in a refrigerator , it should be stable in that condition , it should not generate radical , under the condition of storage.	10.060544334735532
Having looked into a variety of immobilization methods , we should also have a code to characterize an immobilized enzyme preparation by any method.	10.875943986624907
In d s c you typically have a chamber , where a sample is placed.	10.44173165647833
But this is the polymer tree where , basically we make polymers from monomers and monomers has to be characterized very well by all other techniques , to make sure that they are free of impurities.	11.746939656706962
What happen is you get a radical which immediately reacts with a monomer to start the chain , and you have this , all this reaction forming rm n dot and propagation continued rm n plus 1 dot and so on and this initiation process is lower.	10.389271497662008
Now , once this steady state reached r t will be all most constant , but with time what happen to concentration aim , monomer consideration decreases steady state means the concentration of m dot is fixed the time.	8.707062987661182
Now , how do you determine this there two establish method , one is rotating sector method and second is plpsec , which is pals laser polymerization size exclusion comotography plases lesere polymerization size exsultion conmoetrgraphi.	9.386897545421999
Another type of heterogeneous polymerization is dispersion polymerization , in this case you have monomer dissolved in organic solvent , and the initiator is also dissolved in organic solvent and in this case also you have organic soluble dispersion.	10.561723994980932
So this is for these reasons this pro propylene is difficult to polymerize by radical , and this does not happen if you have to say , monomer like methylmethacrylate , where there is no possibilities , this possibility does not arise.	12.166545788547763
You have started with 2 polymer chain when a transfer happened , you have same 1 kinetic chain and 1 polymer dead polymer chain.	9.470781905222315
Partitioning also can be incorporated and which can give you a real performance.	12.958916616531083
Two major sectors of applications of immobilized enzymes are analytical applications and also their application in the therapeutics for the treatment of diseases in human beings and both the applications are also particularly important or in contrast to the application as industrial catalyst lies in the effect that you require much more purified systems and the use of high value enzymes in their applications unlike in the case of industrial biocatalyst where mostly we were dealing with relatively lesser valued enzymes and the two applications on analytical applications and therapeutics require relatively high value enzymes and in a higher purified state.	10.265873170577182
These first four techniques are based on colligative property , so the principles are similar.	11.38518792538982
So , chemical potential of the solvent in this point is same as this point so as the chemical potential of the polymer in this point.	8.474255271514277
So , this is , from this curve this nmr we can say that , in this process we get a statistical random copolymer whereas , in this case you can see that the tendency of formation of a block , a type carbon carbonate and c c type carbonate is much higher than the a c or c a type carbonate , which means the polycarbonate here is more of a block in nature , then this , this is a more random work.	10.065124712379642
They did they generally do not take place and unless we had a transfer agent from outside deliberately all the impurities present , this also does not contribute too much.	10.093871234752092
We talked about very old phenol plus formaldehyde reaction.	8.718877692978124
Soon the reaction medium will have less m 1, because most m 1 monomer then m 2, because most of the m 1 has get you know , as incorporate , got incorporated in the copolymer chain , so feed monomer concentrations , of m 1 will lower than beginning.	11.524603337514687
We can write something like this which is peo polyethyleneoxide or we can think of a polymer like this , which is polyacetaldehyde or we can also think something like this which all of these three we have now written; they have all same molecular formula , this is polyvinyl alcohol.	11.692016164090164
And , i have discussed in the very beginning that polymers are utilized in mainly two o h bonds.	9.349286844045036
We have covered in last lecture our introductory discussion on amorphous and crystalline polymers , and then we discussed what is glass transition temperature , and melting temperature for polymers.	9.619770086665044
Some other mechanism continuing in the , from the last page , how this type of butane hydroxyl tolovines capture or trap the radicals are shown here.	9.821556744869218
Number , nsc.	16.015476174109864
For example , let us take example of this general structure and see how we can think of a different polymers producing getting produced from these general 1, 3 butadiene type monomers.	8.423306949647175
Then the 5 and 5 ring size within 7 to 13 and the least stable is the 3 to 4 ring size.	9.149922243473018
We discussed in length the effect of solvent polarity and if the polarity of the solvents is high , then this ion - pair will be more towards a solvated or free ion - pairs , then in the reactivity of this cationic species will be higher.	10.304119189328977
I am measuring all these terms e0, er and ei in terms of catalytic activity.	9.699328742596595
Again x segments; this i plus 1, i plus first chain has x segments.	9.443638042636413
If you equate the two that is v = rm , that will imply that kf amss = klam . ( sb - ss ) therefore from this substrate concentration on the surface can be calculated as ss = kb . sb / kf + kl or the observed rate is kl . kf . am . sb v = kf + kl then the actual rate constant which incorporates the film diffusion coefficient is this parameter.	9.306955562481104
And to combine or to improve both the solvent resistance and in and the impact properties of styrene one very common approach is taken is a making a for the star polymer where you have acrilonitrile which improves the solvent resistance , butadiene will improve the impact properties and styrene which gives you the heat resistance properties.	10.352528343774027
If a one then it will be n i m i square by n i m i.	8.451144918194052
Now , these beads should not stick which other.	6.858063337626129
Now , because the surface area of the micelles are much more , it is always 99 percent plus or even more , time radical or a primary radical or a propagating radical , oligomeric propagating radical will move into a surfactant micelle containing the monomer molecules; rather than moving into a monomer droplets.	9.309024059721308
And r is the fraction of pairs of adjacent of repeat units that are present in syndiotactic geometry.	9.845502131457401
So , you should be careful about this nomenclature , other you called this as initiator and coinitiator or you called this as catalyst and this is the cocatalyst.	8.840133481137515
Now , that happens if your polymer glass transition is is way above your room temperature.	8.097398228954052
You must appreciate the difference between the internal pore diffusion and external film diffusion while in the case of internal pore diffusion during the transport of the substrate in the particle reaction is also taking place whereas here there is no reaction taking place along with the mass transfer; its only mass transfer.	9.333821478566843
Now , let us imagine what happened inside this particle , you have a polymerization reaction going on at beginning you have a micelle at the beginning you had this micelles , with solon with this monomers one of this r dot or a oligomeric propagating radical gets into this thing , they start polymerization.	10.301256400100506
Now , this technique gel permeation chromatography in short gpc allows the measurements of entire molar mass distribution which enables us all the molecular averages to be computed which was not possible with the other techniques and we can use the gpc as the imperative techniques which we can use polymer per run , and then we can fractionate polymers according to their molecular weight.	10.097687455789737
Finally the most important parameter which we are concerned within the case of immobilized enzyme is their use in continuous reactors or long term reactions whether we can use them in a stirred vessel or in a packed bed or in a reactors or a variety of reactor configuration that are known to us from chemical reaction engineering and we can see that the parameter which is most important to look at the immobilized enzyme preparation property is operational stability that over a period of time when we use it , it should remain stable.	10.92354705048352
In both this case , this initiation by alkyl lithium and also by this electron transfer , you do not have any inherent termination reaction.	8.36949249903458
To give you more example , i take , i want to make polyamides.	12.252688879816434
And , this is the original polymer catalyst combination used by ziegler.	9.538841744669865
In fact we normalize it to get the response.	10.772276733231976
When i say e0, i think it will be desirable to also have the magnitude of kd , the deactivation constant.	9.599225675700655
And today we will start how discussion in mechanical properties , which may be continued in next lecture as well and then , eventually we will discuss very briefly the other properties.	11.288400835991299
When the enzyme substrate complex forms a transition state there is no loss of entropy affecting and the loss of entropy as a result of enzyme binding compensates for the reduction in the free energy of activation.	8.884319888732163
This partial molar volume can be replaced by just molar volume of the solvent.	8.640222145642527
Some of these steps which i have listed here provide this.	9.398650482894855
They may be hydrophobic groups; they may be electrostatic charges or other functional residues.	9.646725404556028
You require a combination of homopolymer or combination of monomers.	9.333694106610507
So , you can yourself from your knowledge from organic chemistry you can justify this ranking , because this is the most reactive radical generates from vinyl chloride will be much reactive compared to the other ones.	9.807267252810194
As i mentioned the variety of forms in which the enzyme can exist either as a free enzyme , immobilized enzyme , soluble conjugate , that is enzymes or in microemulsion form either of the way; that is one parameter and one need to look at the kind of form of the enzyme that gives the best results.	10.904400045926463
So , if you do a reaction say at 50 degree centigrade or 60 degree centigrade that his below the t g glass transition temperature.	7.6467910583511465
That means they are reactivity they will produce a more copolymer , which is more closer in alternate , alternate copolymer than a random copolymer.	8.8464748139151
Alternatively instead of coupling to a matrix it could also be feasible that you entrap the enzyme into a matrix.	10.276688689325258
D is the molecular diffusivity and km is the km value of the enzyme taking into account the conformational changes.	11.257912187401693
So , for , to understand how long they will survive in that condition , outdoor condition , you must whether ability , or mechanism which a polymer gets weathered.	9.673822304619794
So it will entirely depend on the loading on the preparation.	8.147309826500193
Whereas , a flexible polymer will have very you know much higher elongational break , in terms of impact properties again , a stiff polymeric back bone , if you apply impact apply impact then , with a short time , the polymer cannot rearrange and absorb that energy.	11.37336958493266
Whereas if you do at 50 degree centigrade , then even its 74 hours , so almost like three days you have , half of the initiator is dissociated to form radical , so that means it is too slower reaction , if you do it at 50 degree centigrade.	9.812858369963342
And these preferences will always go up if you increase the temperature.	6.388095863904012
Also we must appreciate that the cells , making these functions possible , carry out a large variety of reactions.	8.75219585738091
The response of a step input of the tracer is usually called as f curve.	10.256268724806992
As i said in the first class itself that structure units and repeat units are different , and it will become more clear , i just give 2 examples.	9.369975721303172
For linear polymer what was there for linear x n was , 1 by 1 minus p.	7.545387858005129
So , you have to make sure that all the functional groups that mean all the monomeric species are the oligomeric species.	7.030306277094345
These are same effect of a x is presence of a excess bi - functional monomer to equate these two is added compensate this.	9.716075577854404
The viscosity will further decrease.	12.431109512177045
Now , this is the reaction.	4.447015647057972
The typical example of the use of the non - porous matrix in the bio - medical application has been nylon as a non - porous matrix which has been used to immobilize some of the therapeutic enzymes for use in contact with the blood stream.	9.384242742797433
Now , we are talking about heating.	6.456967723741841
For example if you carry out continuous immobilized enzyme reactor and determine the reactor performance and if you assume that you carry out the steady state reactor performance at various feed velocities that is linear flow velocities what you are doing is we are varying the kl value.	8.91877777850928
So , polymer , polymer polyethylene you have so many single bonds.	7.324494655006214
When the protein molecule gets folded into a secondary structure of alpha helix , the side chains of the amino acids are projected outwards like a rotatory form.	9.643213559176438
Now i plus this polymer chain has how many segments.	9.613901421649718
And the change in quaternary structure is related to the disease behavior.	8.952335904011763
So , in this case , you you actually go through with composition , where m 1 in the m 1 the mole fraction of m 1 in the reaction medium either 0 or .	6.902709346082016
They didn t have any concept of enzyme substrate complex in those times and he only gave a hypothetical suggestion that one could store the enzyme at low temperature in the presence of substrate.	9.528175806776698
If you consider the same class of hexokinase a very closely related enzyme is what we call as gluco - kinase.	8.499603243603188
So , your pdi will go down.	5.794935929085721
You can substitute the value of et and e in the expression and after deleting all the factors which are positive and negative you come up with e0 ( k1k2k3s - k - 1k - 2k - 3p ) v = ( k - 1 k - 2 + k2 k3 + k - 1 k3 ) + s ( k1 k - 2 + k1 k3 + k1 k2 ) + p ( k - 2 k - 3 + k2k - 3 + k - 1 k - 3 ) this comes out to be the rate expression for such a reaction mechanism.	8.82169325329143
A is shown as substrate concentration at the bulk phase , that means at the entry of the boundary layer.	8.91967132043488
But if you want to use a fraction of conversion much higher than 90 % then the pfr becomes more and more matter of choice.	9.423659355388958
The solubility is enhanced by the formation of weak ionic interactions and the hydrogen bonds between solute molecules and water and the protein molecule has a large number of charged amino acids which can contribute to the ionic interactions with the solvent and also formation of hydrogen bonds with the water molecule.	10.728217019442788
Thus the product has to come back from the reaction site to the surface and then to the bulk.	10.398762761611916
When we look at these reaction mechanisms with the increased order of complexity between the dynamics of enzyme substrate interaction , the rate expression will also be quite complex if you put them in terms of individual rate constants.	9.976284082493212
So , you get more and more polymer with average molecular weight remain same.	8.063431002125446
Now , we know to termination to happen termination is a by molecular reaction between say to to propagate radical , we know termination would be by add a coupling or by this propagation reaction.	8.730133648644795
So , the higher molecular weight or hydrodynamic size polymers will come out faster with lower illusion volume and the lower ones will come out later.	9.063790890119238
So , in both cases , actually , decreasing the temperature actually might give you better , a higher reaction rate.	7.784173765347327
Now , one polymer has how many segments.	7.349651221392843
The basic difference was while the lock and key mechanism or hypothesis proposed both the components to be rigid , in the koshland induced fit model it was very clearly understood that the substrate may be rigid but the enzyme active sites are not rigid conformations as you can see here.	9.600161162283126
The jd factor is jd factor = ( kl.	12.416014075524881
This is one , two and three and this acts only on the third one which is on the left hand side.	7.311847440047759
So , this happens for most of the one one substituted alkynes.	9.201517419730502
Where , in the earlier case , it is , the length of the final terminated chain is the summation of the size of the 2 reacting species.	9.733807547473658
The nature of the substrate whether it is soluble , particulate or colloidal , operational requirements; the control of ph in case an acid is produced or consumed in the reaction , reaction kinetics , carrier loading capacity , catalytic surface to reactor volume ratio , mass transfer characteristics , ease of catalyst replacement and regeneration , reactor cost and ease of fabrication.	10.127354467394685
Let us talk about stirring.	8.01812586530611
They have thermal motions; they have kinetic energy associated with them.	9.362158484866375
This was for ideal.	9.095299811713023
Bioengineering volume fifteen , page thirteen , nineteen seventy three.	13.59418860414245
That means the reaction conditions and particularly more important is yield , loss of activity and the activity left in the supernatent.	9.910249444299176
Now , again , because this is produced and we are following that , we should write 2 here , during the termination rate.	9.840499715120867
Now , unless you have something in the reaction medium , further when you take these polymers out and do the compounding and molding step , unless you have something in your adding from outside which will be able to react with either of this left over functional group.	8.852628737665862
It often goes by trial and error and some available information.	11.049436670376986
If you add along with the enzyme sample a known inhibitor molecule the reaction rate which is obtained will be much lower.	9.67992171795219
Now , unlike radical copolymerization this ionic copolymerization is much more selective , you know.	9.711371735248708
So , the time t 0, it will start straining till load is present , or stress is present , it will continue deform , and the time the stress is removed , it will remained deformed permanently.	10.970048769922833
This now you can justify the where this term unperturbed is coming , as if it is present alone , it is not perturbed by any other external molecule , whether it is another polymer molecule or a solvent molecule.	10.420121417179441
Actually , there is a rate of propagation is same as rate of depropagation.	10.574357574166525
So , it takes much longer time compared to chain reactions where the reactions happen quickly in a shorter time.	8.582886758766396
They lead to the classification of ping pong mechanism.	10.528630608625969
You can regulate the reaction rate to an enhanced value or to a decreased value in the presence of those molecules.	9.097708610183458
You should first look for that also you should by know and have a graphs in by this time.	9.205641291649671
Therefore enzyme molecules and the carrier surface are separated by these linkages , the metal salt linkages.	11.464951112917996
If you give higher dose you end up in another problem of side effects because there is no drug which is free of side effects.	9.643403599543639
The other types of this radical initiator are , like for example disulfide.	10.253559779063634
A whole lot of chemical reactions do take place in a living cell.	7.253789237146801
The denominator is total sum of all the kappa factors of all the three species and because here all the three enzyme species are convertible reversibly all the patterns are coming into picture.	11.347757485224069
So , they are used in optical fibres for light transmission , eye goggles and cd.	8.677515501408049
For example , polymer self , heavy used as a packing material for foods , and mainly.	8.397720770062657
So one can easily get the magnitude of.	9.871340862693836
So , you do not you are not aiming for processing this thing or you are not aiming for for heat management all this things.	7.694866095208898
Based on this hypothesis he developed his rate expression.	7.72074750554478
I will give you a specific example.	7.665792295937598
In the second case you notice that it may be a much broad based ph profile.	9.049319317366724
The free energy change of this is highly negative 8.9 kilo calories per mole.	8.429882545532559
That means at high substrate concentration when you are talking of.	8.515807478095352
If initial concentration is zero and c / c0 goes to one that means the concentration of the tracer is c0 and c / c0 is one and this is given over a period of time.	8.755784692525454
So the net effect of the temperature on the overall reaction rate which is a combined parameter between the rate of diffusion and the rate of reaction can be different than the native enzyme because there is no diffusional limitation.	8.017477733576968
The other one is non draining polymer molecule , which is the case for most of the polymer molecules , now in a linear flexible , any flexible polymer chains are closer to non - draining polymer molecule.	9.334772918679562
But whenever it has to be administrated orally you always look for derivatised penicillin and ampicillin is a major product where six apa is . . . . here.	10.816985252436293
Now , if it reacts with itself , then you get bb aa bb.	7.333469014132208
The conditions of concentration of the acrylamide monomer , the concentration of the cross linking agent , that is bis , the reaction temperature are the three major parameters which control the degree of polymerization and porosity of the gel.	10.852694618246309
So , average number of moles of radical in a single particle is n bar by n a , n a is the abogados number.	8.603525545893296
So , if you look few data s you take butadiene and isoprene; obviously , we will compare anionic at anionic polymerization 20 degree centigrade in non - polar medium hexane , anionic polymers at almost similar temperature at non - polar medium.	8.747934716550743
Then we do not get the desire property of a polymer material , which will be useful for the applications of the polymers we usually use.	11.156909499453477
Now another information this expression gives is that the term intrinsic viscosity multiplied by the molecular weight is given by this which only depend up on the volume of the polymer coil in the solution.	10.460156004741139
That is the maximum reaction velocity which one can achieve at some ph when predominantly all the enzyme e0 is present in the form of eh.	8.183162872352602
L . under that condition if you substitute the various terms v immobilized enzyme preparation will be proportional to es1 / .	9.81116183734454
Then the third effect was mass transfer of substrate and product and this mass transfer as we noticed was at two levels.	9.216881798653304
In this case also the reactor although theoretically one has to consider it closer to cstr , but in performance if you look at , it has revelation from the cstr because the concentration profile in the whole reactor does not remain ideally perfect.	10.243692183982896
As you go down in temperature , you get from insoluble system to soluble system , and when that the particular temperature , when that happens for all composition , we call that temperature l c s t.	10.526278137171895
Now , we will come back to the cases where you cannot take out the entire amount of h 2 o produced; we will talk about the expression for those cases later.	8.05366374227578
So , more and more radicals are not terminated now because here the termination his come down , so the concentration of m dot increase.	9.18077288992546
And with that knowledge , we were able to find out the chemical composition of the polymer.	8.257436227868157
The rate of diffusion in such a situation let us assume the situation that this non - porous particle is packed in packed bed reactor and we operate it till a steady state is reached; steady state reached means the concentration of the substrate at the exit end becomes constant with time.	9.40164774779402
Now , if you look at the thermodynamics of mixing , we discuss that flory - huggins flory - huggins theory of polymer solubility.	7.624299010825935
Now , after sometime , plastics yields i will talk about more about this term and it becomes easy to strain if you have this.	9.370456608377419
And we have talked about copolymerization composition drift with time and then we talked about how the monomer reactivity s and different types of chain initiation , you know types of chain initiation , actually determine these values of the reactivity ratios.	9.860798608696378
So , from this , i can now write; or , x n square , k t.	8.415122258153954
I belong to the department of chemistry of iit , kharagpur.	11.942272548373996
So , this is the probability and this is the second segment; number wise if second segment can be placed is z p.	7.585160644645008
Where from this cumin comes from.	10.444030370235497
The carbon atom in both the ch2oh are identical.	10.351613491974357
We also can form similar condensation polymers like polyamides.	9.755310793425483
There are varieties of methods to make the gel network.	9.915521667445548
So , f is 3 here.	7.397776104395773
The f 1 versus no monomer the ratio of polymer composition is versus monomer composition curve is similar to ideal copolymerization , but skewed , but skewed towards the composition of the copolymer richer in the repeat unit resulting from the more reactive monomer.	10.1945014774363
You do not want the polymer to burn , with a flame , and even if its burn , then it should not actually gives , or ignite the other material , other inflammable material in the.	10.607653656955788
So , if you consider the total polymerization so obliviously , the broadness will be much higher.	6.338586867822649
Because of , fog formation and customer will not be able to look at the food material , which is inside the wrapper.	10.918258109480767
In case of polystyrene , as we said , that it is the presence of aromatic groups which basically responsible for absorption of uv light , and that actually causes ring oxidation and which can basically initiate the polymer degradation process , as shown in this figure.	10.428854161827084
So , from the slope of theta equals to 0 line and making adjustment for k dash we can get a 2 from which we can get the values of polymer solvent interaction parameter.	7.907300900498454
You take enzyme in the micro emulsion form and inside the reverse micelle you have the enzyme entrapped in the water cells.	10.018805160780285
No . i am not talking about the stability.	11.029619339462903
So the whole reaction mechanism can be interpreted in the form of a triangle with three vertices , each vertex representing one of the enzyme species.	9.166345292556674
Here you can make modification; if you transfer the reaction velocity in the volumetric form like for example kv = ks . s these are the two rate constants; zero order or first order based on volumetric and surface area and in that case for a cylindrical pore the k will be equal to k = ks . s / v = 2ks / r therefore one can write here as d2s / dx2 v = 0 as the basic second order differential equation a solution of which can give you if you substitute the reaction rate term here depending on the nature of the reaction either by assuming a first order kinetics or zero order kinetics or even michaelis menten kinetics and michaelis menten kinetics will require a numerical solution and analytical solution may be difficult and you can get the solution of the substrate concentration as a function of the distance x from the surface.	10.392021444418997
H / r.	10.274698751426651
Now , if i apply this strain rate , high strain rate from both sides , much faster strain rate what happen , what happen , let us see what happens.	9.219741521565801
But because activation energy for this cyclic reaction is higher , so the drop in the rate of this cyclic reaction is much much higher compared to the normal propagation reaction.	8.987422697815289
One is in the case of enzyme reactions which are controlled by substrate inhibition kinetics.	9.120903957644012
So , define a ratio which is imbalanced ratio or which is the moles of aa number of bb.	11.032465354500868
Basically , they are molecularly soluble with each other so , they are homogeneous at molecular level and of mixing for this type of blends is negative.	11.392580353430871
A stabilized monomer will have more reactivity towards a particular radical and radicals , which are unstabilized.	12.083138896698928
Now this can also get civilized by the process of resonance , which means that this acylnitride monomer , can be polymerized by a anionic initiator , and a radical initiator , but not by a cationic initiator.	9.811191805507065
This is the kind of reaction that takes place in the immobilized enzyme column.	9.387281406880424
In this case , we , let us talk about polystyrene.	6.1168744971809215
Now , that aggregation could be , could be affected by temperature and it is actually lower temperature.	9.071726974938633
Now , you can also argue , that as the reaction progresses , the monomer , the monomer concentration , in this case monomer means the species , which is forming the cyclic , that also comes down because you know , the time goes , the monomer molecule react.	10.17943026382646
So , the effective temperature actually becomes slower , if you increase the heating rate.	8.190846195168934
Some examples of the commercial copolymers as you said earlier the styrene is very styrene homo polymer or polystyrene , polystyrene is a very brittle polymer which breaks easily and also its having poor a very poor solvent resistance or chemical resistance.	10.515058982476353
So , each polymer molecule has x segments.	6.575615680429017
More sophisticated nmr techniques like , relaxation time in a way , they give idea or information about dynamics of a molecule.	10.934491421304829
Now , this is what cross linking is all about.	7.3002231053099225
In earlier case , in bimetallic case we proposed the mechanism was proposed where the new monomer is getting inserted in the aluminum carbon bond.	8.689422033453708
Mind it that non - ideality may also be caused by other reasons like mass transfer , partitioning or variety of other reasons that we have discussed but this non - ideality we are talking exclusively in terms of the flow behavior.	11.06228319524157
Particularly the last example of the immobilization of nadh hydrogenase by crosslinking also indicates the shift of the optimum ph but here the optimum ph shift will not be attributed to partitioning effect.	11.360648689618124
So , this method typically applies to low molecular weights and typically m n value of around 10 to the power 4 to in the range of 10 to power 4 is the upper limit by which we can determine by these methods.	8.582237860882755
So , if you have to improve or increase their molecular weight , you have to take your reaction for longer and longer which makes it more difficult for a polymer chemist.	9.575962020121585
And , this is typically done by use of secondary anti oxidants.	8.199737203383368
That is f ( t ) = c / c0 = ( 1 - f1 ) + exp ( - f1qt / f2v ) if you plot this profile.	9.571144420269807
Whereas , in case of radical , we know , that this termination can be possible by bimolecular reaction of the two propagating new species.	8.331763256031401
So , except the , when except the situation is , p is very high , the viscosity of medium remains manageable and at the high viscosity in , at the high conversion in a time frame the polymer goes up and viscosity also goes up.	9.376487307378255
But at ph seven , the reaction may not be driven very largely to the forward direction.	11.116211957746572
The same process also gave a side effect or rather a very important tool to produce d - amino acids because if the d - acyl amino acid separates out after crystallization , it can even be chemically hydrolyzed to produce d - amino acid.	8.50740836799225
On the other hand if the reaction is inhibited by the product then such reactors are not very suitable because the content in the reactor will also have a very high product concentration at any given time.	7.850809801065075
Additives enable the polymers to overcome the processing difficulties; for example , the polyvinyl chloride , we just mentioned; it also help in overcoming some performance limitations , and it also protect , give the protection in a polymer from the environment.	11.60445639693242
The third motivating factor was the use of the model system for natural enzymes that we discussed and which also has been a very significant reason for immobilizing enzymes.	9.575821685576386
This is the plot of monomer mole fraction verses feed mole ratio.	8.654709245477832
Right in the main reaction mechanism we are writing a plus b going to x and y.	11.5164645989539
So , eventually , the concentration of m 1 in the reaction , m 1 monomer in the reaction will come down to .	10.070725023238754
By now one thing you must have noticed that what we are considering here that when you are finding the probability p , we are just taking that the chance or the probability of one cell being vacant is the number of vacant cell divided by the total number of cells.	10.557558652468638
So that is a kind of scenario you get.	8.253724396242294
Now next we will talk about , the second case.	11.127034330431899
As far as the chemical composition , ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic group or the cost is concerned it is a general feature.	9.95860953243353
This time period is dependent on temperature and the temperature requirement is linked directly with the stability of the enzyme.	8.822121754798333
I have already drawn so you can just see form here , so you can get a curve like this are the locus of the bi nodal points at different temperature , at different temperature you have different bi nodal points you have temperature these , you have temperature these like this at one point they will merge.	10.744503407489603
In the case of this reaction you see the reactants are at a ground state.	7.581787230996901
In the case of covalent catalysis transient covalent bonds are formed between the substrate and the enzyme or the coenzyme.	8.013582944123563
This distinction between the two will be more clarified or clear when we proceed ahead but such a situation exists in the case of bi - substrate reactions.	9.495502370488358
So , the angular variation of scattered light is directly related to the size of the molecule; the larger is the size there will be more variation , because there will be more destructive interference because of the scattered light which is coming from intra molecular different regions; and this starts around as i said lambda dash by 20, it is starts this destructive.	10.72309045223053
There are many unfavorable interactions that is present there and they distort the substrate molecule so that these enzyme substrate binding approaches towards that of transition complex.	8.899482003458006
The process was designed in us by weetall and group which was based on adsorption of glucoamylase on to porous silica.	11.031248172755271
They form dynamic complexes with the enzyme and enzyme substrate complexes and thereby influence the rate of reaction.	7.743026767714697
Some of the natural synthetic polymers that are very commonly used are : collagen , gelatin and agarose.	9.735776264421892
So , m 0 is the initial.	8.968254826983653
We talked about selectivity of the monomers with about the importance of solvent polarity in case of ionic polymerization.	9.488858561973458
Monomers are molecules from which polymers are made.	12.582294193018482
Nanowires or nanofibers , where it is basically whiskers or filaments with diameters in the range of 100 to 10 to 100 nanometer , having high aspect ratio.	11.446602882419748
That means the enzyme experiences an atmosphere which is hydrophilic in nature but the whole reverse micelle is surrounded by the organic solvent.	7.588407352135111
So , because you have 10000 units , you are getting 100 times lower value of the contour or r m s end to end distance.	7.648303167584383
So , if you compare in a in a standard different groups , in case of in case we are talking about hydrogen atom proton , now this protons will have chemical environment , so they will have experience of a different magnetic field; so the resonance resonance energy will be different.	8.3327072516021
If you have a acid or ester or amide , it can also be polymerized by radical under less anionic , if you have a nitride , again it can be polymerized by radical and anionic , not by cation.	9.536392164495513
So , when you have more and more branching in this case , the chains are the dispersion the , the polymer chains are having lower and lower poly dispersity.	9.554366082019914
So , name has , will be polyoxyethylene instead of polyethylene oxide.	9.08960397608463
So the rate of change of concentration of e - s is zero and the steady state assumption.	8.120340690381889
And next lecture onwards i will start the chain polymers and chain polymerization with starting with radical chain polymerization.	7.917654883757666
I apply some time t 0, and keep at a constant level for some time , and then release again , make it 0 at sum t t.	11.490578000878806
If you have little amount of monomer then t g will come down plasticization will happen more monomer more plasticization.	10.655410563322404
It reaches a limiting value of 1 + i / ki.	6.077513429098551
So , the rate of reaction is given by k 3 and the concentration product of this 1, and which 1 is this; number 1 is this.	7.825307855737589
So , you have to have some compromises , you have to make molecular weight somewhere intermediate , so you get the best of both.	8.435616201019354
Easy clean or self - cleaning type additives , which are basically very hydrophobic additives , which on migrating to the surface make the polymer surface very hydrophobic , such a way such a extreme that , when the water droplet condense on it , it cannot hold on to the surface , it basically rolls off.	11.298761678321867
This is the radical is get generated this is the propagating radical.	9.326524207416067
Now , we , we talked about thermal initiator.	6.446683941090276
So , eta is the viscosity of the polymer solution , eta 0 is the viscosity of medium , and this phi 2 is the volume fraction of the polymer chain , so what we can easily show that , this expression would give this expression.	9.442748272797745
We have learnt the mechanism of step - growth polymerization and its comparison over chain polymers , and we also learnt how and what is the effect of equal reactivity of functional group , and we also understood the justification of why the functional group of reacting molecules including the intermediate species should have same reactivity irrespective of their size and irrespective of whether the functional group present in the other direction is already reacted or not.	9.528904325883898
This is the very first reaction which they carry out when the methane is used as carbon source.	8.635686906808836
In fact people have defined as far as the choice of solvent is concerned a parameter what they call as log p where p is the partitioning coefficient of the solvent between a particular solvent and octenol.	9.852455047179852
Now , how many how long the flaming will happen , that has to be fixed for , comparing between materials , typically it is three minute bonding or flaming.	9.861494663981933
I just wanted to give you a brief idea of different types of step polymers and how they are synthesized commercially , just in a very brief.	10.456710624640376
Hdt is typically as general rule of terms about tg minus 20 degree centigrade.	9.885795905131314
So , you can imagine that this polymer coiled solvent is like a impermeable sphere , which consists of the polymer coil and the solvent molecules , which are associated with the polymer chain.	8.591121235444506
Such cases are very commonly found and in most of the practical cases they are not usually ideal type of inhibition patterns.	10.888468115207974
In such cases you notice that such enzymes do not really strictly follow the typical michaelis menten kinetics.	7.974809949882116
So , it is not that all the z number of cells will be free for the second segment to go in; there is a probability.	9.065442475909483
The physical methods most commonly used are ultra filtration or dialysis such that the enzyme is fully restored to its initial activity.	10.735150254625209
For simplicity one can assume a linear gradient and so therefore rate of mass transfer here will be equal to rm = klam ( sb - ss ) this is sb; this is ss.	9.493305360195368
The second part of today s lecture is to discriminate between the different reaction mechanisms.	7.572769859045411
Now , this is cellulose.	7.022975348054589
Now , r is defined in such a way that it is always less than equals to .	6.067898841756468
For examples , that ba 3 water case , i can write this is a proton donor.	10.769234879042195
In this case , in the telomerization case , rate of polymerization is fast the monomer is reacted much at the same rate , as if there was no transfer reaction but the molecular weight drops.	9.51340517565661
For invisible blend , it does not matter that , you know that t g is for the homopolymers , obviously then you can know you will know the t gs for the block co polymer immiscible block co polymer , or invisible blends.	10.97173407814342
So if you increase the temperature , then we will get more of a syndiotactic polymers and again this we are talking about where you have either we are talking about radical polymerization or anionic or cationic polymerization where we are carrying out the polymerization in a polar medium where you have the counter ion and the active centers they are free as they are existing as a free ion.	9.720313456300858
It is of course independent of m w of the polymer.	7.192425699188371
Any composition above this curve this solid curves will be completely soluble they will have single phase.	11.388698887831527
Each path way must consist of n - 1 steps where n is the number of enzyme species present and the product of the kappas of the steps in each pathway is determined.	9.152341427438563
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
If you reduce the temperature of previously , there will be increased tendency of syndiotactic polymer formation.	8.605755693953704
In this case , r 1 multiplied by r 2 is 1 or r 2 is 1 by r 1, we can write k 2 2 by k 2 1 k 1 2 k 1 .	9.11440631227308
So , while deducing consider that the vapor phase v f as a ideal gas.	9.600621553118664
So , if you compare between the , within the , let me write down , write down these things , so in a polar solvent you have , say contact.	8.421691977470125
So , the reaction molecular rate increases linearly , where in case of normal chain polymerization , you can get very high molecular even at beginning of the polymerization and in such case , the molecular rate is small at the beginning and it increases slowly after.	10.998850444430152
You can get maximum concentration monomer if you do in a pure state , so monomer concentration is high.	8.97290643245717
If you make a mass balance across this differential element at steady state you see the output of the substrate will be pr2.d ( ds / dx ) out.	7.564738456877533
And with related to that , we will talk about the glass transition temperature and the melting point of polymers and then we will talk about the relationship between chemical structures of polymer chain and how it is effects the values of glass transition temperature and melting point.	8.385744147947092
If you do anything which will increase the strain in the resulting polymer that will also reduce the decrease in the value of del h.	8.988405460982353
So , polymer properties are tested on the final product or final specimens so , unless we know the polymer processing step , their it there will be gap between resins and a product or applications.	10.472506309111123
The behavior remains the same.	8.849389371753027
If i go up again from 7 member ring , again it goes up 8, the strain goes up and then again it starts up to 1.	11.198637370214225
So , you get a dead polymer class species as in the case of the transfer to the monomer.	6.173551400376584
All the enzymes are not specific to the same extent.	10.361136724379985
The concentration in the starting material is of the order of about one kg per meter cube which is significant enough to recover and you don t require for the most cases a very high degree of purity and therefore their cost is also reasonably low say for example about thousand us dollars per kg.	9.473710831321286
If you consider two molecules in a binary reaction , bimolecular reaction that is a and b and both of them are in their ground state keeping in view all their electronic , vibrational and rotational ground state but possess translational energy which makes them to move for the collisions to take place.	9.2137400472723
A characteristics feature of this method is that ultimately when you get this material you end up in a gelatinous mass.	10.069954114933573
His proposal was a slight modification of the lock and key arrangement.	9.96015752974722
In a detergent formulation you have surfactant polymers and other ingredients.	9.319033368210723
For example in the case of adsorption you require a carrier.	6.678956357935009
He was from italy.	14.532155491992285
So , it the monomer itself take part in the initiation reaction , then there is another terms comes.	9.242305671994815
The alternative way is to design reactions , where k will be high because if k is high , then you can afford to keep some of the condensate molecule in the system and still build a high enough molecular weight.	9.118180680266022
We will just give a example in a minute to elaborate more on that , composition if you are talking about say copolymer between a and b , we will be able to find out using nmr how much a , and how much b , in the final polymer what is type of chain structure , whether it is random or it is alternating or it is a block.	10.577879107236875
But in a particular method of immobilization the steric hindrance results in a definite loss of enzyme activity which is a real loss and cannot be recovered by physical methods.	10.10346954290934
Mild refers here not to the value one or two it refers to those conditions under which enzyme is conformationally stable.	11.546321190958992
So , what would have been the average , if all this 0 to 180 degree is equally probable , then what would be the time average.	8.681304962161141
Let c p and so c , this is to be c p; c p verses t would be discontinuous function because this is the second derivative of g and these are the first derivative of g.	11.62182082584549
We are giving the definition of yield that means the total amount of activity , which is resulting in the immobilized preparation is reasonably high , almost in the range of say about 70 to 90 % enzyme activity is recovered in immobilized preparation and because the conditions are mild they don t tend to cause conformational change so that is a very plus point as compared to other methods in which yields will be much lower.	10.759590594950886
So , basically this value is negative and is negative means is equal to electron rich , negative is a charge for electron.	9.508533179009014
It was for one.	8.768421035839692
With a small stress , you can strain the sample much more fibers is the extreme case.	11.738660826192646
And then finally we will talk about effect of temperature and polymerization rate and as well as effect of temperature and molecular weight of polymers.	9.636950832177934
The rate of diffusion can be enhanced significantly as a result of increase in temperature and particularly in the case where the system is diffusion controlled the temperature optimum might undergo significant change.	9.692889885651956
So , you get a curve like this.	3.795201820964591
You can consider the substrate concentration as ss if you leave out the external film diffusion and on the other hand x = .	9.697273060612773
L /.	8.259689227874071
Then microstructures , alternate random blocky structure , how the reactivity difference between the monomers actually give this type of copolymer microstructure.	12.641658285313053
And , they finally , they can form this , which is responsible for the yellowing of the polymer material.	10.997031357821163
That means we simulate the value of v.	9.328761274081941
On the x axis also this will intersect which will be - 1 / km.	9.657074850348991
And if we increase the temperature further , rate of depolymerization also increases , so as rate of polymerization , as we discussed just now.	9.357374933707906
So , those depolymerization reaction do not contribute at all , so we do not have to worry about the backward reaction.	8.45653757953553
The concentration profile of the feed at any given cross section of the reactor is flat.	10.213717221173455
L will increase from a small to large value either in thickness or in enzyme loading , behavior will change.	9.4671298720475
Most of the industrial applications will require the application of computational science in those systems.	9.018050708470737
If you combine equations 6 and 2 energy of activation for faster reaction if the k2 is high that means lower energy of activation . these two conclusions do arrive from the theory of reaction rate which is now well accepted world over.	9.929231869695009
You don t keep it in a cell; you isolate but then again revert back , kind of a pseudo cell for example you entrap that into a micro capsule which is continuous semi - permeable membrane or take a very fine porous film attach an enzyme molecule to this and then this mimics as much as probably your enzyme was supported on a membrane in the living cell and study its properties.	10.466739182017779
The enzymes exhibit remarkable specificity because of their precise fit between their binding sites and their substrate.	9.932742471984099
Normally if there are n binding sites and the binding process continues sequentially then the enzyme must be available in different species in difference forms as e , es , es2, up to esn.	9.724722618929263
You can find three different types of isotherms : linear is simple; freundlich is more general in the sense that it does not fit into any hypothesis but in general you can vary curve fitting.	9.948364310573321
Now , this value of del h is also important because that dictate you the exothermicity of the reactions.	7.810021153112563
And as we discussed it will give you a syndiotactic polymer , syndiotactic methyl methacrylate.	8.54828439479057
A very generalized scientific approach to classify them will be on the basis of their porosity.	8.737710139738649
So , we should consider a open and driven system where there is a incomplete removal of our condensate material.	8.67626343544889
So , what is the entropy of mixture mixing in this case is same; entropy of the mixture s 2 is given by s m and it is the same what we have seen earlier.	10.832352837033543
Because in the handling of colloidal substrates , you often find difficulty with the flux flow reactors.	9.638079050400858
And a large amount of monomer present as monomers droplets which are stabilized by the surfactant , so let me tell you one more time that at beginning we dissolved the initiator in the water , and then when we add the surfactants surfactant form micelles , many micelles; and there will be some surfactant as a free molecules in the water medium.	10.272597441654272
In that case we assumed , one basic factor , that the dissociation constant for binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme and the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme substrate complex is identical.	7.204941396626991
In the last class , i have said that polymers can be originated from a natural sources and i also said that those are minor class of polymers.	8.839081276776596
So , we can remember what the purpose we were trying to convert this raw data to distribution plotting weight fraction versus molecular weight.	6.959686655158114
Now , it can be degraded easily to this poly molecule which is nothing , but glucose.	8.391976613715952
Obviously , to improve property one , this type of exfoliated nanocomposite with nanoclays always preferred.	9.639770918683952
And it prevents formation of those flammable organic compounds volatile flammable organic compounds , they basically prevent the burning process.	9.845360601161714
They are not very sterically hindered and either they have a beta hydrogen for elimination whereas , in case of methyl methacrylate because it has a beta hydrogen , which can be easily eliminated.	10.897997983511004
So , more c h 2 groups we put in between the polymer chains , more flexible or less stiff.	9.658431186176763
So , we can design the polymers of certain structure , certain chemical structure to get a desired value of t g.	7.806205713159666
They may control the film thickness and these might call also a diffusional constraint particularly with respect to transport of the substrate from the bulk to the site of enzyme catalyzed reaction.	8.37633010986599
I think we will stop at this point.	3.574635905901903
So , actual number of distinguishable arrangements would be; you divide by the n 1 factorial and n 2 factorial.	8.595943624607447
Saks is commonly used for measuring sizes of dispersed phases in polymers and also it is suitable for getting polymer morphology; whereas , sans is basically we got the information about the radius of gyration , it can be used in bulk medium or bulk amorphous polymer.	9.783780166412102
As we can see that the t c value depends or the relation between t c and m e depends on the values of del h and del s p.	7.332488962435933
Similarly extraction of water from ethanol to give ethylene or dehydration of ethanol.	11.363316547276783
How does a particular group of inhibitors bind to the enzyme molecules.	11.65040949345956
What is the process index which is given by m w bar by m n bar , same as x w bar x n bar is 1 plus p 1 minus p divided by 1, 1 minus p which is given by 1 plus p.	8.032913438851486
For initiator , we can write similar transfer initiator , k transfer initiator m dot i similarly , we can write for solvent , cta and so.	10.516807447343533
The other effect based on the entropic contributions is orientation effect.	9.545048511093094
How it is handling.	14.247400901671888
But as long as we are assuming that the stoichiometric relationship is unimolecular they will be identical.	9.389928102969673
So the enzyme is fixed.	9.930130173388637
And , if you choose not to write 2, then during the initiation reaction also you have to choose not to write 2 in the; it will come back that initiation reaction , rate of initiation , again when you write the expression for r i , rate of initiation.	10.34897218472476
In fact at a concentration of point one molar the reaction is stopped when almost hundred percent hydrolysis of the l isomer was completed and the kind of profile you get is almost a sigmoidal profile and at a space velocity of approximately about eight hour inverse the reaction was complete and that means hundred percent of the l isomer was hydrolyzed and recovered.	10.1455839727628
The first contribution was enzyme substrate complex , the second was buffered substrate.	9.785322258024891
Therefore the enzymes play a very central role in the function of living cells or in other words you can say that they are one of the most important executives in a living cell.	8.122586569465454
It is tongue relatives to the angular the distribution of the scattering light , as scattering intensity , and if the size of scatter is large , the angular distribution of scattering intensity will be higher , so it is always prefer to minimize the size of the scattering center , to get maximum value of the clarity.	10.645874464112588
There are ample literatures available from which one can write for pore diffusion control first order reactions , assuming spherical particles in the packed bed reactor the effectiveness factor is given as 1 / f = [ 1 / f ( 1 / tan3f - 1 / 3f ) ] that is the relationship between f and effectiveness factor and using this effectiveness factor then you can write down the reaction rate expression for first order kinetics.	10.143640782198084
You can choose any of these monomers , which were utilized to make homopolymers , and then mix them , and also you can mix them in , or make copolymers in different proportion.	11.320764543610784
Then there are several intersections possible , which is basically when the which is happening after several several steps , which is basically longer , it is not immediately immediately two of the segments or two of the bonds are overlapping with each other , but it can come back , because polymer chains are flexible it can come back and occupy the same space.	10.989967478415844
So , you should know a priori what is the relation between a molecular weight and the ratio between the monomers by a function or if we add , what is the effect of molecular weight if we add some mono functional group from outside.	10.064010973018403
To take care of that another important plot was proposed in 1974 by cornish and bowden.	10.212995638101887
S * / r ) exp ( -.	9.302772797521763
That means the enzyme required for the same fractional conversion that is 90 % in the case of a cstr will be 4.5 times more than that required in the pfr for the same conversion.	9.108407182469888
You would recall that in our previous lecture we had discussed what are immobilized enzymes , why should we immobilize enzymes and what are the requirements of immobilization of enzymes and the three major requirements a soluble enzyme and the carrier and method of immobilization.	9.806768877029212
So , in a crystalline polymer , you have the polymer chains placed in definite order , but it is impossible or it is highly unlikely that you can make a perfectly crystalline 100 percent crystalline polymers because polymer chains are very large and they are flexible.	10.791575386870988
This is the interaction energy power contact and q is the total number of polymer solvent contacts.	6.925629550983315
In the case of fourth one initially you have very high decay and then it is continuous.	9.561309768349856
Km is much , much larger than the s0 in the first order.	8.16197640417718
So the cost of the carrier must be taken into account in terms of per cycle not the absolute cost.	9.505043167156511
It will not react with the functional group present in the polymers formed itself.	8.698561075808513
Similarly the recovery process involving labour if it is very tedious again immobilized enzyme processes will be more favorable.	11.896395309446829
What is the definition of x n , is the number of monomer units present average number of monomer unit present per chain , which is obviously will given by number of monomer unit consumed or polymerized divided by number of polymer chain , simple.	10.177021612770261
It has decreased means higher affinity; the concentration of the substrate in the enzyme active site is much higher.	7.756669922188358
But the enzyme glycerol kinase acts only on the third carbon.	8.693702059318202
Remember the last class we talked about synthesis of polycarbonate from phosgene and based , where the compound or the small molecules which eliminated what hcl.	12.879427418391298
All the pipes , most of the pipes you see in the home or other applications are made of pvc , their applications vinyl sliding like window frames , rain gutters.	10.75506264050426
Now , to be successful as a surface - active additives , the additives must have some attributes for example , it must be partially comfortable.	9.29300192994298
We also learned why we should study polymers , polymers as you by now convinced that find applications in conventional applications as well as very newer applications , very high end applications and we also learned why nowadays polymer is used more and more applications , what are the good properties of polymers and why polymers are different , you know why polymers are get what what are the structural features of polymer gives you this is improved properties and then we also learned big picture.	11.605401066466383
And happens that happens for large flexible polymer chains long chains and this this polymer molecule can be precipitated by one equivalent , this is equivalent hydrodynamic particle , and one has the same friction coefficient as the polymer molecule.	10.65669871641891
So , you have large molecule at the beginning itself.	6.951631737517309
Detection is important because if you cannot detect this inert tracer , it doesn t serve any purpose.	12.128622704768102
We move to solution polymerization where you have require monomer solvent and a soluble solvent soluble initiator.	10.909467398085695
The crosslinking method also must involve or identify certain optimum conditions for the crosslinking.	11.236215590483209
And in case of plastic deformation in the polymers especially , in case in case of amorphous polymers , cooperative motion at of a large number of chain segments happen together , large say number of chain segments corporally move with each other.	9.204705917381549
So , let us now talk in detail about the cationic polymerization.	6.231179073276838
This is derivatised by hydrogen hydrate to polyacrylamide hydrazide and this polyacrylamide hydrazide then is coupled to a co - enzyme nad which is derivatised in the form of carboxymethyl nad.	9.851174990010787
So , it is floated against temperature.	6.041454066578228
If you degrade starch you will get dextrins and these dextrins if they are cyclic molecules we call them cyclodextrin and the alpha , beta , gamma cyclodextrins are six , seven and eight glucose molecules linked in the cyclic form.	9.921150632880883
It gives you a much increased activity and that is the major advantage.	10.09836775196147
In most cases the methods based on adsorption are reversible in nature.	6.807630752882039
So , multiplied by 2 functional group , 2 each to make the total functional group reacted.	10.273537021966709
So , this is if it slightly positive and this is and the value is small and it depends between the completion of this two to which will decide whether the polymers will go in to solution or not.	9.35948488088936
If the system follows such we can evaluate or conduct a reactor performance on the basis of biochemical reaction , their reaction kinetics and to do so the major reactor design parameters which have to be considered are listed here.	9.125476519169533
Now , because this is radical , it will be again part of the equilibrium process with z.	10.015025062820458
The first term in the parenthesis represents the mass transfer function; the other is dimensional number which gives you the operational parameters and here kl is a mass transfer coefficient;.	11.165590493025507
And if it is positive then the lower is the value of delta h sub m it will be it will be better for mixing.	9.253764210359495
In cases where the binding is random , that means the inhibitor and substrate can bind randomly without any sequence , the mechanism of un - competitive inhibition is very rare.	10.210095437645592
There will be no biasness of m 1 sitting next to m 2, or m 1 seating next to m .	9.630327202863915
So , like earlier when you talk about cationic polymerization here also you need to have a very stringent requirement of so that you do not have a moisture , any moisture present in the system.	8.881912658347465
Such an experiment can be even monitored.	11.788130188150394
The reaction mechanism as we have expressed earlier is k1a , k - 1, ea.	10.994811074695066
That means for design of a particular type of reactor what kind of design parameters are important and you will recall that we had also hypothesized certain conditions or assumptions which define an idealized enzyme reactor system and the assumptions were that isothermal operation ,.	9.434746534911097
So the effect on k2 that is the turn over number is primarily almost like any other chemical reaction.	8.149171081694803
That means the half life of the ternary complex is very , very small in this scheme.	6.3177557891065454
On the right hand side i have given you the various methods that we have talked about.	7.549550639918994
So , which which are considering the small molecules also as a part of polymers and we are getting the polydispersity of 1 plus .	10.329304171252407
Mind it; this t should not be confused with the space time.	10.01087306854473
It is generates when it propagate at the end is basically c h to y c h to c h y and so on.	9.02244569749348
Let us talk about the example i just showed you before.	8.03548163261894
Now , r i is what , is given by n p by r i , where r i is the total initiation rate , total number of initiator is generating and n p is the number of particle where they are going , so for one particle the initiation would be given by r i by n p.	9.8817841874562
With the start of experimental data one assume certain mechanistic hypothesis that means how various molecules involved in the reaction are interacting and you propose some kind of a mechanistic hypothesis or in other words you can say in a simplistic term the sequence of reaction steps that are involved in converting substrate into product and based on these mechanistic hypothesis or reaction steps we arrive at a rate equation using mathematical analysis.	9.833868665254183
Now , take a concrete example of a polyamide formation.	9.159227705567755
It is not that one discipline for example understanding only biochemistry can lead to understanding of the applications of enzymes in the process industries.	8.165559272674443
Each initiator molecule produces , if we consider a thermally initiated polymerization , each i produce 2 r dot.	10.845775812927332
And this is known as kepler as a trade name and this is nomex and these are both nomex and kepler have very high melting points.	11.333903580361987
Therefore the half life of the enzyme in the living cell , the stability is much higher compared to a free state.	9.443435933680684
So , what is usually done in in practice industry in most of the applications is require that you cannot have this much of drift in the composition of your polymer sample.	8.317073818914727
Three most common types of adsorption methods are based on physical adsorption which is again a most non - specific type of adsorption where we use hydrogen bonding , electrostatic interactions or vanderwaal interactions , a variety of interactions where there is no specific reasons and we use a very broad range of carriers like alumina , celite , bentonite , glass etc where which by certain conditions of ph , temperature and salt you can adsorb the enzyme on to the surface and they can be used.	9.738452905097324
So , apparently , there is no reaction going on.	8.257240079738466
But if you use a column of immobilized enzyme for a controlled hydrolysis of a protein sample , first thing no amino acid will be destroyed.	10.057724350706001
And now , you can see that this both the binodal points as well as the spinodal points , they are actually temperature dependent.	11.460188873554104
If you recollect the value for say your x n say this is your average degrees of polymerization for a thermal initiated polymerization.	9.182408547554845
There are main , too main reasons why they are not so utilized commercially.	10.20163206565076
These are called binodal and these are called spinodal points.	7.605022931380243
It s a very fast reaction.	7.115738218227459
Then another problem is instability to denaturation in biological fluids and proteolytic attack.	10.26931501117064
And usually there is no loss of molecular fragments , like , in case step polymers , we had stormed , small molecular condensates , where coming out , during polymerization process , but in this case there is no loss of fragments.	11.235571871335269
Talk about briefly extrusion process , extrusion process as said , this is steady step process , this is continuous process having high productivity and it is used for making low complexity of parts like pipes sheets and so on.	11.561367049228215
Now , let us talk about great dilemma in case of polymers.	5.318408116897267
If the propagating radical is more stable , then the reaction will go towards right hand side.	8.527970029881022
So your del s would be less negative , your if your ring size is larger.	10.485534506325815
On the other hand f is equal to tanh.	7.672389853443557
So , that is what this entropy change and deformation is the dominant contribution in the to the resistance of the deformation in case of elastic material.	8.384298704193782
Now , in this case , what happened.	3.8752869855600762
That is we are considering only either a pfr or cstr which is an ideal flow dynamics in the reactor.	8.311359700880816
The fifth one is solid enzyme particles suspended directly.	11.208715438575528
E0 is a fixed quantity when there is no inhibitor in the reaction.	10.325157265484266
If del h can be increased , by improving the inter molecular attraction , if you increase the inter molecular attraction between the polymer chains , then obviously the delta h of melting goes up.	9.609148776692468
So , in that case , what happened is the next alternate way.	6.325880433148984
Basically 6 member ring is not thermodynamically feasible the opening ring the opening polymerization of 6 member ring is not thermodynamically feasible.	8.50926087663287
So today if you recall we have considered in general the basic theoretical considerations behind the catalysis as it applies to any chemical process.	10.339242305277564
Now , they are , there are , there are not termination reactions for these type of initiation or propagation reaction , but some polar monomers can have side reactions present , which actually can , which actually can determine or be detrimental for your molecular weight build up.	9.79943665109149
Typically , polyesterification , they have the order of a 0.1 to 10 poly aberration of the order of which probably is the highest among the known reacts.	10.861208736663954
Now show the inter convention of each of the enzyme species say for example e es , es et and et e.	10.371749569953463
In general for an isothermal reaction which usually most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions are the effect of internal pore diffusion can be clubbed or can be expressed in a parameter what we know as effectiveness factor.	9.201248609742944
If you bring contact , if you bring that polymer in contact with acids , or basis , then it will hydrolysis , and as the molecular degradation will happen , the properties will come down.	10.80690213609196
Now , if you consider even higher theta value and you consider a theta like this which is higher than theta two then the phase difference between the two scattered light is even higher.	8.695328016615662
You can make solutions of different concentration and you can measure viscosity of the solvent and viscosity of the solution and from viscosity of the solution and solvent you get relative viscosity and from there you get specific viscosity and from there you get reduced viscosity and inherent viscosity.	8.73762887267886
So , i can take it out.	6.0061592081527735
They make this process definitely , they make or they synthesize the polymer in the , polycarbonate in the plant them self.	11.116233786352861
Now , you know , del g is del h minus t del s.	7.8093872501246535
So , this number is nothing but the number of initiator residues per chain , which we call or term as b.	7.973586616395217
So , this extent of transfer reaction for anionic polymerization is much less compared to cationic polymerization , which means , that the side reactions and the , cation , the chain transfer reactions are very less if you have a very pure monomer and moisture free environment.	10.210009399999763
This in brief terms can be the broad definition of or broad objective of this course.	8.502898500345054
So , i am writing this.	6.548878479454549
There is a third possibility is like this 0.5 percent nitrobenzene nitro benzene in this case reactions starts from beginning , but with the much smaller rate.	10.275523704940055
Similar thing can be shown in case of that strain rate , with higher strain rate , it will behave more elastic , and is very slow strain rate , it will be close to perfect viscous and intermediate strain rate , it will be , so visco elasticity.	11.181574065316399
Similar symmetrical substituent we have seen , that t g brings down polar functionalities will increase the intermolecular or interpolymer attractions , which will increase the t g.	10.695896653813964
This para amino benzoic acid is the starting substrate for synthesis of folic acid.	10.072897119142672
So , you always have a something like a distribution big , small , medium like that.	7.629251483619148
So , k s c is basically the equilibrium constant between the concentrations or because of the partition of polymer molecules inside the pores and outside the pores.	9.938260245123837
Solute in this case it is the polymer.	11.62708671026795
First is that as i just said , that it is , it is much more selective , much more selective.	11.029951416990574
Now , as you have this so many confirmations , the size and shape of the polymer molecule will depends on; obviously , the chain length , now as the chain length goes up , you expect the size also go up; obviously ,.	10.121137445114902
So , it is sometimes very difficult to take out all the solvents from the polymer quantitively.	9.402858483302463
So it is always recommended that you should use a i b n at this range , and b p o in this range , to have a moderate reaction rate.	8.520674586504773
There are a lot of structural similarities with xylose and glucose.	8.739706858875365
You can form a block polymer like this.	7.3715998526007285
And this case also you want to stop the reaction , you can add agent through which by which it can external agents which will terminate the cationic chain.	10.188933142260623
So , if and the reactions are between functional groups.	6.5444827755105255
If you know the solubility parameter of that alcohol then you know what are the , you can estimate or you can basically zero down , narrow down the choices of your polymer which will not be soluble in that alcohol , which will be use wiping those or sterilizing those equipment.	10.769187365221757
It should not have a perspective that all crystalline polymers are semi - crystalline polymers better properties than amorphous polymers.	9.638134500520398
This is the approach what we are taking; we will add the polymers one by one and for single polymers we will add each segment one after one.	9.05467845620311
So , whereas in earlier case the number of repeating units were same as number of structural units.	8.229106238207224
Now , when you add the monomers a very small fraction of monomer would be soluble in the aqueous medium , there will be small fraction of the monomer inside the micelle core as a soluble.	9.50284560632045
So , now , write the kinetic expressions , now we are found that , this is the this is the expressions gives the average degrees of polymerization without any transfer reaction , where only the termination is due to either coupling or this propagation.	9.973529666086701
That means the potential as a result of the charge in the two phases.	7.24487943234561
This is p.	15.583181170903746
They are usually isothermal and therefore the problem of heat transfer is not so severe.	11.14039395322203
So , the function of extruder is to pump the high viscosity melt , also mixing the ingredient.	9.439190383338707
So , that is the assumption we are making and we are telling that is mean - field approximation where we are considering that all the segments which are already present in the 3d lattice are distributed randomly; they are not joined , they are distributed randomly.	9.718215750109918
So , what happens to the molecular weight if you plot molecular weight versus time.	10.111969361986953
It means that , you can use how long , and what is the service temperature , if you can make like that example i showed in the c d , what is the service temperature , that like means what is the maximum temperature , it can survive for long duration , at a for the particular applications.	10.87475165264127
Another criterion which plays a very key role into the carrier matrix.	9.930157339541731
This is short time.	8.04831129155398
This is where the question comes that when the substrate and the inhibitor both are bound it influences the whole molecule in such a way that catalytic function is lost.	8.235555474015486
The second issue was to recall bio processing of unnatural substrate.	8.626234100510857
But in this case because there is distance between the matrix surface and the enzyme , steric hindrance is minimized.	11.117326881869534
Today , we will continue the discussion we had on step growth polymerization.	7.368859210670713
These terms represent the concentration terms . similarly if you look at eh2 eh2 = eh.	10.798112801544494
So , we must when we testing , we must keep those condition intact to get the report is full or repeatable polymer property measurements.	9.815990084534313
Although many of the substrates which are used in the enzyme reactions may be neutral , like ethanol or any other non - ionisable substrate , many of them also contain carboxylic group or hydroxyl group or amino group.	10.678037424343552
Normal chain growth polymers like polyolefins or polystyrene , polyvinyl chloride , they have these carbon hydrogen bond , carbon chloride bonds; these bonds are very prone to degradation by a variety of environmental agents.	11.562348808395496
Both the things are feasible.	9.134582871081177
Such groups are able to donate or accept electrons or protons to or from the substrate in such a way that it weakens its reacting bonds before the reaction process actually begins.	9.273918052901758
Now if you have this r depending up on size; obviously , you can imagine if r is high , the more the size of r , the trans product will be more dominated because the energy difference between cisoid and transoid will be much higher as you increase the size of the r.	10.24013965881044
Or in other words this t is nothing else but the induction phase after which the reaction measurements should be made so that steady state hypothesis is valid.	8.292754656558897
The glutaraldehyde is composed of two different reactions.	10.919232789924072
Now , if in a normal situation what will happen , the water droplet with condense in that flame and it will hinder your visibility , somebody is visibility through that flame.	9.722690267366783
They are proven to hydrolyze.	8.931083528009177
The substrate molecule recognizes the enzyme species present on the immobilized enzyme.	11.05690249971923
Now , let us talk about the molecular weight distribution in case of radical polymerization.	4.604173281130158
The more and more this initiator generates in the system , active species more and more chain gets.	11.63865611063173
Now , we will come in a next lecture what is unperturbed dimensions , but what does it mean in brief as if polymers are present as such without no interference or no interaction from the other polymer molecule or the solvent molecule , which will discuss what the meaning of unperturbed dimensions in detail in next lecture.	8.9833443952665
Polymers are most cases thermal insulator which makes it or enables polymers to use in electronic industry and unlike the conventional materials like wood , metal they are optically clear which enables application of polymers in media , and optical devices and one more important that there are so many polymers available in market that you can choose a definite polymer for your particular applications.	9.988562505714341
Whereas this correspondence to , the 80 percent of free monomer m 1 in the reaction mixture , while this is correspondence to 80 percent of the monomer aim in the co polymer.	9.101689004096162
And any composition between this point and c and d to n would be stable , there will be clear solution.	10.245325164109612
So therefore the high molecular mass which results into impermeability through the biological membranes is a major problem.	9.195521444001205
Now with which basically gives lower modulus , lower strength , however the same flexible behavior can be helpful in case of impact properties.	11.277897259202998
At the end , all these carbolic liquid will be consumed and you will land up a polymer or oligomer chain with both sides amine groups.	9.292800962662954
The activities of the final enzyme preparations and the percentage yield of the activity from the.	10.681136996746021
Vmtrue / ( 1 + k / h + ) you arrive at a relation where by you see the vm is the affected by a factor 1 + k / h + in such a case if you plot the profile of ph , which is negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration , with log of vm you end up with a profile like this.	8.792482535861616
In the case of proteins the beauty lies in that it is a very highly folded molecule.	8.92093731358426
Now in this polymerization , chain polymerization monomers are , monomer is present throughout , but it concentration decreases gradually or steadily , and we also know that in , during this chain polymerization we have only monomer , or high molecular rate polymers.	9.442010705168144
So styrene is example , where styrene can be polymerized other way anionic cationic , or a radical group has well as as well as radical group.	11.894915122252842
This under steady state conditions must be same as the rate of a reaction and that is v = k2e0ss / km + ss if you substitute the magnitude of the ss from this expression and simplify you get k2e0 [ sb - v / klam ] v = km + [ sb - v / klam ] the steady state rate of reaction will be given by this expression and the ss will be equal to sb - rn or v / klam and therefore and 1 / v will be equal to 1 / v = km / k2e0 ( 1 / sb - v / klam ) + 1 / k2e0 that gives you the 1 / v if you consider the extreme conditions , that is when sb is very high or we are considering zero order regime.	9.944277102538182
If i go back to the earlier slide as i said that most of the current synthetic polymers are made up from monomers which are ultimately sourced from petroleum products as there is a increasing interested interest to make polymer from the monomers which are not source from petroleum products , because on using the polymers or making polymers from petroleum , there is a fear of you know depletion of petroleum resources.	10.428060146353998
When these fibers are passed through toluene , they get coagulated , the polymer gets coagulated with the water droplets , the aqueous droplet of enzyme being entrapped in the fiber.	11.595551924626427
So , if you have a coil and if this is the center of gravity then all the segments.	8.221042155503554
There is no binding of the inhibitor molecule with the enzyme substrate molecule once the substrate molecule has bound to the enzyme , the inhibitor is ineffective.	12.404870285651693
When we talk of the enzyme for immobilization if we want to . . . immobilized enzyme preparation what properties are important for choosing the enzyme source.	11.619359326673907
L . when you say f is equal to one , there is no effect on the kinetic parameter km or there is no diffusional limitation in other words.	10.948051278879433
So again the reaction will take place with the amino groups and the hydrocarbon chain will be inserted in between.	9.291152587217615
They , they actually can be used for ionic species polymerization , but this is , these are not very generic in the sense , that the solvents , this solvents also can react with anionic species as well.	11.061250890563672
Remember we just discussed in last lecture which just means this is not exactly , but this is approximately proportional.	12.050879189125205
Now what is that probability.	9.425731591448939
Typically this method is applied to step - growth polymers because we know that step - growth polymers produces end groups functional end groups in the end.	10.006763384861323
Number of ways you can arrange is 1 because no matter how many times you interchange the molecules you will always end up in same arrangement.	9.3458301411371
When i use the term denaturation , the term denaturation does not in any sway consider the break down of the covalent bonds.	9.59518532148983
So , if you go back and look at this screen , computer screen , this is the in this process of polycarbonate this peak is correspondence to a a , this block , this carbonate , and this is corresponding to this particular carbonate , and this is for the this particular group.	8.704328761349819
So , if you look at the optical properties of the polycarbonate , light transmission is more than 88 percent for this 300 thickness pluck , and haze is about one percent whereas , in block copolymers b , where the domains are having smaller sizes , that is all that the scatterer size is very small.	9.323728115204673
But what he found that it not only gives high molecular weight polypropylene , but it also gives a very high stereo selectivity; whether it is a isotactic , completely isotactic or syndiotactic.	10.69331779102562
How do the go about the reaction.	9.762719091446552
And , in the redox is basically reducing agent and the oxidizing agents , and i gave example of peroxides and a reducing agents like iron.	10.386223531390382
In the case of cstr voidage can be considered almost equal to one whether the volume occupied by the carrier is very , very small compared to the total reactor volume.	7.162301643484652
So it falls in the category of both actually.	9.772767017047778
Now , where it can also react with a another linear molecules and then stop this chain and form a sight in middle of another chain.	9.648240461698343
So , you have polymers which you can get from natural source , but in majority of places a polymer is synthesized from raw materials , monomer by process called polymerization.	9.927706234393476
The induced fit mechanism can also explain very clearly the bimolecular reactions which were difficult to understand as far as the lock and key arrangement.	9.076383177042196
First you get the rayleigh ratio for only the pure solvent which must be completely dust free otherwise , the scattering from the dust molecules and which will give the enormous error in your measurements.	11.385751978801437
These are the broad observations by brown.	9.732058339082299
That means , they are side product which are small molecular in nature which affect m m mode than m w , which means the n w by m n goes up.	9.459251510087823
Now , in during that deduction of that kinetic equation expression , we have used functional group like this which means we have considered the reactivity of functional group independent of the size of the molecules and here , it found to be that expression is valid for almost entire range of conversion region , which means that this assumption what we have considered here , that equal reactivity of the functional group is valid even experimentally.	10.17279637074727
So , we can use this expression to determine the number average degrees of polymerization in an ionic polymerization.	5.656578456331734
However this catalytic efficiency is attributed to two major molecular strategies that we had discussed earlier and they are binding of the substrates to the enzyme on the active site mainly the major play ground here is active site present on the enzyme molecule.	10.5917636734434
At a very low substrate concentration , when substrate concentration is much , much smaller than km then your initial reaction velocity will be equal to v0 = k2 e0 s / km a first order kinetics , with k2 e0 / km as a pseudo first order rate constant kf.	7.993597351269997
Now , basically we have covered almost all possibilities of different combination of r 1 and r 2 values.	7.54698254307887
So , what is m minus.	7.387213627442104
Also these proteins may be very simple proteins for example a simple amino acid polymeric chain.	10.806746446842272
We talking about random co polymers , where their due to the molecular irregularity , they rarely form crystal.	11.177386144682105
And those situations become much more complicated , and those are basically very difficult to get impossible to get theoretically , so what is done instead of getting expression for the contribution due to the rotational restriction , for short range steric interaction , we have introduced a new term which is called steric parameter , which take care of the , who takes care of the rotational restriction term.	10.963838720123272
So therefore if suppose the bulk substrate concentration is itself very low there is likely hood that by the time the substrate reaches to the inside pores , center of the particle there is no substrate present and reaction cannot take place even if enzyme is there.	9.94345470582346
Because of these two large groups , they cannot take part in bimolecular termination reaction among themselves.	11.401112923092805
This active center is regenerated.	10.870663068825726
So a very important aspect is assay which you should be very clear.	10.736905602169047
So , this is basically a guideline for where the peaks come for a corresponding to functional group , polar bonds show strong absorption that ir frequency generally , and intensity shape and the position of this ir bands are typically used to identify the type of absorption.	9.97547534406459
So all the side products can be absent , which can make our life comfortable as far as the purification of the product is concerned.	9.755064616022452
And at glass transition temperature , rate of expansion increases abruptly.	10.905493956327032
Flexible modulus increase with elastic modulus generally , generally flexible modulus and elastic modulus go hand in hand.	11.547420938107962
So , it is polymeric materials which can be formed or can be transferred into different shapes by heating and subsequent cooling and this cycle can be done several times.	9.527482681782798
So , we need to find out something else where that constant can be applied to any of the molecular rate of the polymer chains.	7.744707382107007
During process there might be some handling losses and which might reduce some quantity and this factor is primarily because of the handling losses during the regeneration process.	10.577919842410871
If you just understand the enthalpic factors we must consider that the transition state is like a molecule with some of its chemical bonds in an unusually extended or strained form.	9.483682525930373
So , what we will do in the next lecture , we will talk about the strategies by which we can achieve this situation this situations , so that we can make all the polymer chains of similar size , because they are started from same time , and continue it for same time.	7.069640103358708
That means 10 % and 90 % and the ratio of the two , s0.9 / s0.1 is conventionally called as co - operativity index.	8.068497516667074
In the next lecture we will discuss the scattering from angular dependence on the light scattering for large molecule or polymer molecules which we have angular dependence; the light scattering will be angular dependence.	10.173192100044394
Therefore the effectiveness factor can be more than one in the two cases that we have just elaborated.	9.435606654414038
So , that is the maximum you can go and if your reactions system is good , your reactor is good , your vacuum system is good.	7.973636998975256
So if we can determine the concentration , we know the concentration of the polymer and what is the concentration of end group which we determined.	10.284613619509829
Now , if this is added from externally; the concentration of this is .	9.517979940004045
H , the enthalpy change during the enzyme substrate binding.	8.51726327726627
There is lot of chemistry involved because different people have proposed different kind of chemical reactions.	7.933111930376027
We discussed about , what is the cost for scattering , and phi absorption.	10.70849845723386
Now , obviously , with the increase in the polarity of the medium , if you increase the polarity of the medium , this , this , the more polar means , the ions get solvated and then finally , get as free ion , ion - pair.	7.559022816415347
For most of the cases such a hypothesis has been verified and found to be proven under certain limited conditions which have to be in line with the assumptions made by the scientists.	10.141001611221652
L less than one and v mobilized will be proportional to es . .	10.919576707365582
It was half of the maximum reaction velocity their.	10.757367313880271
You can call it transient state or free steady state period also but as soon as this transient period , which is very short time , passes both the enzyme substrate complex and rate of formation of enzyme substrate complex becomes a steady state and this will become zero.	9.955469365757082
So v into rate of reaction is the total accumulation and the conversion factor and by canceling the volume term from both the sides you can arrive at the integrated form of the equation and this equation if you integrate , it will lead to the reactor performance equation.	10.668992646367624
If it is even higher the viscosity for the medium becomes very high even at low conversion at lower time.	9.007099959408642
We have mentioned everything , now i am just summarizing one after one point , so that i will give you complete picture , what are the parameters , what are the conditions you must have in place , so that we make a successful higher molecular weight step polymer.	10.773709843338699
So , these arrangements are overestimated.	8.378865230121963
In the case of substrate inhibition the reaction velocity when you increase substrate concentration does not reach to a saturation level rather even earlier than that it deviates and passes through a maximum.	8.203156826578699
Basically when you , basically put fire on a polymeric material , it basically de polymerized to monomer , and it degrades to combustible gas , and in the presence of heat it basically have form flame and it burns.	11.184958043227235
There are many other unfavorable interactions available at the active site and these interactions tend to distort the substrate in such a way so that it favors the formation of a complex which is analogues to structure in transition state.	8.055740497704445
This is very true very often in the case of reversible reactions and in such cases the michaelis menten kinetics will also be valid provided the interconversions of the intermediate complexes are the rate limiting step.	8.736168685904387
And once the molecular size is same molar volume is same; the mole fraction would be equals to the volume fraction and the change in or volume of mixing would be .	10.148469776898606
Cross linking helps in a very significant manner to control the porosity of the matrix; higher the cross linking smaller is the porosity.	12.41052245493132
Now , let us consider a polymer having repeat unit molecular formula of c 2 h 4 o and that is the formula of the polymer repeat unit.	8.486648539446316
In this fourteenth lecture i plan to you know continue the discussion we had on the thermodynamics of radical polymerization , which is valid for other chain growth polymerizations as well.	9.186560298970784
The definition of mild condition refers to those conditions which are environmentally acceptable to the enzyme.	8.80339225087187
So , if you can bring down such a level that rt is insignificant , then there practically no termination reaction would happen.	7.993162683735387
On the other hand the dimer of the gluteraldehyde forms an addition conjugate along with the enzyme and it again gives you a precipitated mass and both the forms remain catalytically functional.	8.867685182099306
Now , one thing you have to also remember is to build high molecular weight.	6.859068669090544
We will discuss these two in a minute.	6.591153980272162
If this is a cation , then it is a cationic polymerization , if this is a anion , then it is a anionic polymerization.	10.980984960354881
Now , that actually enables a from external agents which will be open first and then propagate.	9.440089615070791
The anti oxidants basically retard the oxidative degradation process of polymers , which is initiated , the oxidative degradation is initiated , when free radicals are created in the polymer material by , either heat , uv , mechanical shear , or metallic impurities.	10.744156330800532
So , using this termination reaction , with a definite reagent you can actually create , you can terminate and as well , you can create the functional group at the end of the polymers , polymer chain , which is very useful and which can be utilized for several other applications.	10.948483475160707
Up to some time there is no concentration of tracer; suddenly at a given time we start a stream continuing the tracer and so here it becomes c.	12.089664339708442
Its quantity is functional property and the activity represents functional activity.	11.261670847841422
Ultimately the performance will be dictated very heavily by enzyme kinetics.	8.725613935461368
Then another feature is the effect on the double reciprocal plot , lineweaver - burk plot and the nature of lineweaver - burk plot which is influenced as a function of inhibitor concentration will also tell you about the class of a particular inhibitor.	9.083240849787053
Usually the covalently immobilized enzyme preparations will have a half life of few months when operated in a reactor and when stored under storage conditions it could go even for years without any loss of activity in terms of half life.	10.535770219500234
The third factor which contributes to loss of enzyme activity is partitioning effect.	7.760125415386631
This is your kb and this is your ka.	10.279853626569704
The concept of vm the maximum reaction velocity , the concept of michaelis menten constant , the physical significance of these two parameters which are the critical parameters also remain the same even with briggs and haldane.	10.419606393486559
The cell does a variety of functions that is crushing and grinding , transport of materials , power generation , control of information , transmission of information and then release of finish products to the user client.	10.653029548228812
Other properties do not changes in molecular that much , though it also increases with molecular weight , but it does not keeps on increasing , even if it slightly with molecular weight , the other polymer will study it at a high molecular weight.	10.213443339304437
Of the total enzyme activity , the activity is distributed into two fractions - the immobilized enzyme as well as the uncoupled enzyme in the residue and these two theoretically should combine and form the total value of e0 but very often at the end of a method there is some balance left and the balance is the loss due to deactivation during immobilization.	10.343156578119274
Due to thermo chemical reasons it might get inactivated but for some time it remains intact.	13.061334041855266
Now there are other like thermal behavior , thermal test basically done , is high cut softening temperature point.	9.968073012767542
For oliphinic polymers like polyethylene , polypropylene , it is very difficult to find a cation which might complex with these oliphinic polymers; it is very difficult to cationize and then analyze this polymers by maldi; and water soluble polymers already which does not soluble in a solvent is also very difficult.	9.452044418074662
That means they are neither intrinsic nor inherent but they are just apparent and they can be modified if you design your system in a way that you can have a very low enzyme loading to the extent that the overall rate of the enzyme catalyzed reaction is smaller than the rate of diffusion.	9.471434307867401
So , what we just now learned we have learned what are chain what are chain transfer reaction and what are the different types of chain transfer agent could be possible , it could be initiator , it could be monomer , it could be a transfer agent , to be solvent in all this case , except the chain transfer to the polymers.	8.961788489316596
In this case , h 2 o for a polyesterification reaction , it is not possible to take out all the 100 percent h 2 o which is evolved.	9.486390210127308
When the concentration goes down , reaction rate increases and therefore the effectiveness factor is one.	8.875526839478395
Remember , it is the number of molecules at the beginning , and number of molecules at the end , which will give you the average degrees of polymerization.	7.212333126040341
Simplifying this you can get.	16.34316154092718
And then sell it to some original equipment manufacturer which do this processing step , molding step to make the final product , which goes into the final applications.	8.457255779123527
It will not be homogenously distributed at every point in the reaction mixture.	7.632760461457317
In this case , 2 oligomers having 2 function groups at the end , they will work if you compare with this smaller , smaller molecule.	9.14528619218533
As we know that , the polymers have undergo glass transition and melting transition at at a adiabatic temperature for example , if you pure amorphous material undergo go glass transition t g whereas , semi crystallized polymers undergo both glass transition and a melting at t g and t m subsequently.	9.763046098575668
So , what will be the t c.	6.133167240316299
Whereas , in thermo plastics you have to compromise between these two , you have to choose a molecular weight somewhere in between , so that your mechanical properties is just above a critical value of your requirement , and your process ability also is handable , means you can do processing.	10.408004269164374
If you look at each of the points where we have paradoxes in terms of the actual enzyme catalyzed reaction and those which can be done by michaelis menten kinetics , the first one that the michaelis menten kinetics deals with is the single substrate enzyme catalyzed reaction.	9.34443412622253
For example , if i take a this again coming back to the example of polyester.	6.7122977149098775
So , this modulus is the material property whereas , the movement of inertia captures the contributed of structure design and the shape on the stiffness.	8.785280650408652
But in case of radicals we have seen , that the steady state concentration of the active radicals is very low and as a result , the propagation was comparatively low in a slower , in compression to these ionic polymerization.	9.710313386514365
Now , if you replace one solvent molecule with another or you can change the position of the solvent molecules with another solvent molecule , you can imagine that you are not creating another distinguishable arrangement.	10.027142416010458
Whereas , in case of inelastic deformation , when we apply the energy or apply some force , the energy is lost.	8.84454972275473
Synthetic polymers can be classified as the organic polymers.	9.342311841640335
It only accelerates the reaction rate by an order of magnitude.	12.370316443663901
This classification is based on the cost of the enzymes.	10.443468232581727
So , r p is proportional to the concentration of the monomer , and it is proportional initiator concentration.	6.893327077692357
So , that is another observation we can make from this expression.	6.151213397582467
And once you get the individual values for different monomers , they are those values of q and e are further defined by copolymerizing monomers other than styrene.	11.22430038032838
In the case of enzyme we are talking of enzyme substrate complex formation.	5.701126799993951
Similarly , you can increase the inter more attraction , you can introduce some specific bonding; like hydrogen bonding , that will increase the enthalpy , the delta h of melting , and by that we can increase the melting point , and obviously better packing is always help in increasing the , you can understand better packing is always improve the t m melting point of the polymer.	10.600799152783443
And this case , it is if i talk about this thing , they will be different , so all these three arrangement r r , m r and m n they will have different chemical shift.	9.908362712550849
Another example that i like to illustrate is also a normal molecule , production of l - aspartic acid.	9.306537525855873
Now if such thing happens , then what happened.	6.759513730754478
So , there is two opposite effect when you have multiple number of chains , consider single chain intramolecular interactions long range interactions try to expand the chain , to avoid the self intersection , whereas to avoid the intersections between the segments of different polymer chain , intermolecular long range steric interactions try to compact the chain.	9.036784999980457
Now , if you plot with time , see this is experimental plot.	7.5814012580537975
So the point where the maximum change in slope happens , some people consider that as a t g.	8.529302244272062
So , in this way you can understand , that solvents play , solvent means , i mean polarity of the solvent plays a very important role in terms of reactivity of these ionic reactions.	9.054843540792124
And of course this beads are absorbed , beginning they are absorbed with this dispersions like water soluble , polymer of the inorganic , particles we have to make sure you watch this beads thoroughly several times , to get rid of this dispersion.	10.164065777859811
In different cases different kinds of changes in optimum temperature have been noticed.	11.00363004274612
Then the fourth property which is a very important basis for choosing the immobilization method is carrier cost and regenerability because each method has a limitation of the choice of carrier.	9.80259490439711
Now , let us talk about size.	3.745159191865958
So , scattering intensity will be lower or excess rayleigh ratio will be lower in this case then what it was in case of theta equals to .	10.670882673064026
R o p by name as the name suggests it is a ring opening polymerization , so you have ring in monomer having ring structure and you polymerize it , and make a linear polymer.	9.996437175012877
Unlike the normal poly condensation or step polymerization process.	8.34700598012077
For this case we are ignoring this 2, and so that the value of k 6 and k 4 are very in significant.	9.63424298966497
It gives you a very big inference when we look at the reaction mechanism also and that becomes a very important part of the study of reaction mechanism itself.	10.320207708820165
So to maintain the same temperature between the sample and reference , you have take out some energy , so delta e becomes negative.	9.231973301384171
And if we have groups like , acrylic acids , methacrylic acids or styrenic , which have a strong absorption , then this this this type of polymers actually help us in detecting the trace amount of residual monomers; if the monomers are present , then it will give us from uv signal , uv - visible absorption signal for that monomers.	10.644849058010353
This should be taken in a very broad sense.	12.109215310423274
Now , obviously , to do this exercise you have to identify peaks , which are correspondence to particularly 1 munity for example , this one we had for the styrene munity this one for this pmma munity.	11.300771023797534
Here you will have k3 and k - 3.p.	12.369245882908807
Now , when , this functional group present in a small molecule , compare a situation if you have the functional group , 2 functional group present in a regal molecules; now , is under stood that regal molecules will have lower deficivity , they have lower deficient rate.	9.86669585154232
So , this expression we got from the theoretical calculation which we just carried out but it was before this theoretical expression was arrived by flory fox , mark and houwink has actually arrived to this expression semiempirically by experimentally.	9.088686803452406
The two phenomena of orientation effect and orbital steering are related.	9.575357572802991
So , the solution will be the polymer and solvent mix like ideal solution , if this is if the value of chi becomes lower than half then the coil expands polymer expands in solution , which promotes mixing.	10.074479912684566
Now , from this correlation we can get the information about z average diffused translational without going not going too much in the equations , we can just say that this correlation give us the information or the value of z average translation diffusion coefficient.	10.016929530691025
So , if you stop your reaction to build a molecular weight or target a molecular rate of 100 degrees of polymers correspond to 100, if you stop the reaction at 99 percent conversion level starting from one is to one , so isometric ratio you get this , but this will pose lot of difficulties in the next step when you do processing steps like compounding or molding because this has presence of active functional group.	9.293384691171804
We call this as resins; you might have seen this granules or pellets yourself in sometimes in the market and if the final applications is does not require very complicated geometry then in this process itself you can make the final product for example , like sheets film where in this processing step itself , the polymers are taken and the additives or fillers are added and it is given a shape of the final products like sheets and film etcetera , but this is not the major application this is the minor applications.	11.104151413098911
We are discussing that polymer might degrade in presence of uv light , or in presence heat or light.	9.814088637080129
And there few general thumb rules , if the atomic mass if the atomic number are both given then i is 0, so they are nmr inactive the atomic mass is given , atomic number is odd , then it is i s whole integer , and all nuclei having odd atomic mass , they have a half integers , so like proton , carbon 13 they all have i value of half.	10.530045283821966
For a given molecular weight , the shape of the polymer changes like from rod to sphere to coil then the molecular size changes and the elution volume is related molecular size not molecular weight; hence , the elution volume also changes.	9.717003245520829
For polymer , what we discussed is , x i is the number of polymer segment.	10.535652989631394
The monomer stabilization is more or same between styrene and alpha methyl styrene.	8.303828965040365
You see the particles shown here; let us say a kind of a spherical particle not perfectly sphere but something which can be assumed to be spherical and with a network of pores within the particle and the enzyme is located while on the surface as well as on the bulk of the enzyme.	10.462250902691368
He defined a parameter z as equal to e nre2 / 3.nse2 / 3 y1 z = ln 1.09 av y2 here sigma is voidage as we are familiar; renault number and the semite number and av is the ratio of particle surface area to reactor volume and y1 is the mole fraction of substrate in feed; y2 is equal to mole fraction of substrate in the product stream and z is the length or the height of packed bed required for mass transfer.	10.184262617595714
It has two distinct functions binding of the substrates and catalysis and both the functions are a result of the amino acid residues present there primarily and then the shape , which is brought about by the conformation.	10.105098102272818
If you take logarithm on both sides logvm = log vmtrue log ( 1 + k / h + ) if you consider the extreme conditions that is when hydrogen ion concentration is much , much greater than the ionization constant or in the other words the ph is smaller than pk , then log vm = log vmtrue.	8.311572590665612
If the molecular weight is quite high and viscosity is very high which is you know more often the case.	9.608388699272513
So , in this case non - polar medium and lithium counter ion , they will be remaining as tight ion pair.	7.771930779804021
So , we are not writing t i t i.	6.288351027419578
If you look at higher value of.	6.157239265904527
Now , from this reaction , if you look at the equation little carefully you can find out , that if the monomer concentration increases both r p and the number average degrees of polymerization increases , which is the molecular weight.	8.332890120225652
Then again extraction of water from 1,3 - butanediol to produce 1,3 - butadiene which is a substrate or monomer for synthetic rubber.	11.121171578038494
So , if i carry out a ionic polymerization where we have a strong coordination between the counter ion with the cationic or anionic chain end and the incoming monomer , then the approach will be from , always from the same side of the same side , so you will get a isotactic polymerization.	9.509638509150866
Now , what will be discussion in the next class is take this forward , this ring size and we know that what the thermilyn factor is.	8.917565513647077
Their retention in the entrapped method is far superior compared to the soluble enzyme.	10.012306319741567
In most cases the stability is enhanced and therefore it becomes a desirable feature.	8.049761804276573
Then the dispersion medium which is a aqueous solution with the with the dispersions or added and stirred vigorously.	11.320650156756754
All the steps which go outside from the ea i am not taking into account.	10.092676657553975
So therefore when we shift from zero order to first order regime the efficiency of plug flow reactor improves interms of its enzyme requirement or even in terms of space time.	9.269742621331465
The most established and analytically proven method is langmuir isotherm.	10.636052874218597
Now , this reaction is nothing but reaction between functional groups.	6.878849451643312
For examples , amines , triaryls , trialkyl phosphates , triophenes , they can actually act as inhibitor.	10.068507355835525
One is the degree of cross linking and the other is to change the solubility parameter.	8.868912084334443
In practice there are reports that even in an immobilized enzyme preparation itself there are no uniform enzyme distribution practically.	10.776956678340634
So , actually the rate of , so net rate of polymerization would be rate of , polymers , propagation minus rate of depropagation.	10.210875881723721
So , you are getting less than 2 value if you have if you have a less than 2 value.	8.981504908084025
All other reversible inhibition studies will be based on these five approaches in general.	10.498791697283579
All these information can be used very significantly for those purposes.	10.61779620587349
And if you keep on increasing the temperature , one temperature will come where that equilibrium concentration is equals to the free monomer concentration your know pure pure monomer concentration.	8.55317941209524
Now , this polyethylene is not branched like the polyethylene.	7.794461471055784
Two monomers will react and form like this , species like this.	10.03422783250632
Now if you , for ionic polymerization if we do polymerization in condition where the ionic chain end and counter ion they are present as the free ion , then they will be as a radical polymerization . . . and , if we do the reaction in conditions so that , the counter ion is strongly bound with the active chain end , then what happened.	9.677428448686197
We can divide the operational stability in two major patterns.	10.118817578872939
They are identical in terms of confirmation.	12.596023609157847
Then obviously delta g mixing positive so that mean unfavourable , but if this composition is phase separate into a point here and here , the delta g be negative.	9.62059285795601
Hence k s c would be given by e to the power del s 0 p p by r.	10.274842304614145
Obviously as you can expect from the structures , these two both isotactic and syndiotactic will have regular structures.	10.907247131942007
So , handling will be difficult.	7.430008823149254
Now , network have cross links points , lose ends entangled , this is entangled especially entangled between two chains , physical entanglement , there is no chemical cross linking here , it is basically one chain here entangled in another.	11.97840657664623
So , the total number of ways the polymer segments of i plus first chain can be placed and will be given by the multiplication of all this segments; first segment n 0 plus x i second segment z p.	7.983892613869005
The hexose is present in the proximity of the enzyme , the enzyme will bring both hexose and atp along with the binding sites and then it can flop around the two molecules and the reaction can take place in a very fast speed.	11.05958139714189
Now , that happens in case of biomacro molecules where you have exclusively one such conformation present in the sample.	9.848441009746779
Extra quantity of those will be provided in the electrolyte otherwise you will not be having a functional enzyme preparation in the immobilized form.	10.285653843633538
And unless if you do not choose the solvent very carefully the solvent can participate in chain transfer reaction , reduce your molecular weight further , so you have to be very careful.	10.815563914754984
This property of leaking of the enzyme from immobilized preparation has been very advantageously used in many cases of the enzyme therapy purposes , where we want to put an immobilized enzyme preparation onsite at a site where the enzyme is required and the enzyme must leak continuously not in a very high concentration and over a long period of time.	11.14037450894587
It could be two different type , visco elastic which may and may not shows permanent deformation and there is another type of deformation deformation where , the plastic deformation where , permanent deformation happen.	9.900509839008782
Now , if this b dot which is this radical is very stable that it is does not take part in further reaction , further chain in reaction , it might degrade or it may react with itself forming non radical sphere.	9.003128705173353
This is from this expression this will be rt by m n and the slope will give the value for the second period coefficient from which we can get the value for polymer solvent interaction parameter chi.	9.804242329918903
First of all when we do instant testing , we one thing we must remember that; as we do this test , the dimension of the specimen changes.	9.950989147666142
If we express this mathematically little bit and see what is happening.	9.215926205851098
In cases only where there is ordered sequence of binding of the ligands , the un - competitive inhibition is feasible.	9.304538278828586
Now it is easy to express the concentrations in terms of molar ratio , where f 1 is the molar ratio of pre monomer in the reaction medium , so we can write , this as m 1 m 1 plus m .	9.321245476291148
I will illustrate how we do that but the basic principle is that it should be in the proximity of the sensing site of the transducer.	8.994542357295805
As we know , the first step is initiation.	8.630869546037912
Any mechanism by which you can take the reactant closer to a transition state not by formation of transition state any other mechanism which can do that will facilitate or reduce the energy of activation.	8.747308571797507
That means if the system has no partitioning behavior or no diffusional limitations; diffusion will be there because there is a phase difference.	9.60038508677418
This needs to be confirmed again by chemical modification studies.	10.819749997592103
Once the substrate binds to one of the binding sites in some cases the binding site might induce a conformational change thereby making the affinity of the substrate molecule to the other binding sites more favorable or some times unfavorable.	10.174377439571852
And the commonly these are called i will show you the example in the next slide , if you have co these are called polyketones and specifically this structure is called poly ether ether ketones and simple this called polyether ketone , you have if you have a sulfonegroup so 2 group in here then these are polysulfones.	11.818249295470972
E0.s . k2 k3 / k2 + k3 v0 = { ( k - 1 / k1 ) / k2 + k3 } + s here in such a case k catalytic in analogy to the original michaelis menten hypothesis will be equivalent to kcat = k2k3 / k2 + k3 not a simple k2, the turn over number will depend upon both the parameters k2 as well as k3 and that is another fallacy which is built in the michaelis menten kinetics.	9.762306024704463
And , it is very difficult to avoid these reactions.	7.408947800153762
If the enzyme is more stable under alkaline ph , then we can take a method which is based on alkaline ph because if you find the whole range of method , you can get in the whole range of ph conditions , whole range of temperature conditions and temperature usually we do not go higher than ambient for all these kind of preparations and the immobilized enzyme preparations.	10.074449991477033
We have to do a reaction where we always continuously take out the condensate from the system.	7.083739509028242
So , that distribution actually goes up.	5.755626391616847
This can be written as vm.	7.6309618380094415
Similarly , you can break down this number of degrees of polymerization , number , average degrees of polymerization into two terms , one is temperature independent , i can break into two terms , this is temperature independent and the other term , k d k t to the power half , so these are temperature dependent.	8.72286855424352
Polymers can be made from more than one monomers as well , different monomers which is showed in pictorial in two colors and in that case you get a polymers consist of two different structural units , you and we call them as copolymers.	11.18998697913952
Binding of the substrate to the enzyme involves some expenditure of energy that is the binding energy involved in it which ultimately gives you an advantage in the reduction in activation energy and there is an initial energy.	11.030976852380679
This reaction can also be carried out chemically using a chemical catalyst , like zinc catalyst at 400c and high pressure , almost few hundred atmospheres , and the turn over number is of the order of 2 x 104 s - 1, that means number of moles of methane oxidized per second per mole of the catalyst.	9.09102090870184
So , unless you do not know , what the power polymer properties means , how their evaluated and how they are related structure how they are related to the polymers structures then , it is difficult for you to design a new polymer and then , synthesis it.	10.333746032254531
The last method based on the adsorption process is by inorganic bridge formation as i mentioned or metal salt linkage.	10.051465022567706
So , now we have two expressions huggins equation and kramer s equation.	7.192225209454803
The second class of analytical applications is enzyme electrodes.	9.489011744230108
Typically , this polystyrene , polymethylmethaacrolate they are used as standards for organic solvents , organic soluble polymers and the molecular weights for other polymers are reported agility to polystyrene or polymethylmethaacrolate and for aqua soluble or water soluble polymers; the standards typically used are say polyethylene oxides which also can be synthesized at very narrow or mono dispersed standards.	10.914585918821903
Basically , there is no salvation , so del h is 0, so basically the temperature has minimal effect in terms of reaction rate.	10.917747412857826
However , this polymerization is ionic chain polymerization , gives us opportunity to synthesize specialized polymers , like block copolymers or tellically polymers , which are basically type polymers , having functional groups at the end of the chain , which we can , we utilized for the , for another reactions.	10.088489967423973
Vander waal forces the attractive forces resulting from favorable interaction between dipoles is a very important component in the conformation of a protein.	10.75302555553799
So , this is the number of molecules present which have x mar in x number of x mar , which means number of molecules or changes present at any time having x number of structural units.	7.841145214254775
That means while substrate and the product might be homogenously distributed the enzyme will be localized in some area of the space.	9.77938146004402
And that is because as we discussed earlier , differences in the refractive index between this fillers and the polymer matrix , and if the size is large then it can cause lot of scattering.	9.404355316226745
For example , poly methyl methacrylate.	5.616850072179599
And we know that cationic copolymer the monomers , which are having electron donating group as a substituent copolymer.	9.186616209339366
If this eh is the form which is catalytically active , that means it binds to s the substrate and forms the product.	9.715403865410808
If you start a reaction of alpha methyl styrene from pure monomer at 61 degree centigrade , what will happen.	7.301836520609238
The what is the importance of kinetic chain , why we are discussing or defining a term kinetic chain length nu , we will now know that , degrees of polymerization is directly proportional to nu.	11.02279302202299
It can be explained for the fact that the chain ends , for the polymer chain the ends are more mobile , more flexible because in case , the one of the sides it is not tied up from both sides , whereas some , any segments in between they are tied up by both the sides.	10.691776599462525
We write , this is k d i.	12.90012670578596
In most of the practical cases whether it is a plug flow reactor or a cstr , the error involved in assuming the whole reaction to be under a first order regime or a zero order regime is not very large depending on initial substrate concentration.	8.935810711302986
Let us look at some of them.	6.016829082329394
See , if i write expression for rate of initiation , it would be ki , concentration of this species , y plus iz minus and concentration of monomer.	8.659158955520766
Increasing stiffness also gives lower impact strength , and elongation at break , because if you a stiff back bone , you cannot elongate before it breaks.	11.188490106441584
So , let us stop here for this lecture , and we will complete the course in next lecture.	6.087811355092864
If it is negative , then with decreasing temperature you get increase in polymerization rate , but if it positive , then with decrease in temperature you get reduction in the polymerization rate.	9.340550624300366
So , if i want to define a glass transition temperature , that it is a temperature at which the glassy state is changed into the rubbery state.	7.903786473305979
So the micro structure you get consisting amorphous crystalline region , are basically non equilibrium structure.	9.272478315914897
So , all the disadvantage of the bulk polymers should not be present here because you are doing in a small small volumes and small droplets and because its present in a in a surrounded by aqueous medium.	9.021706356710254
Structure modifier : the additives which modify or influence the molecular or super molecular structures , like compatibilizer , they help in making compatibilized blend; cross linking agents , which obviously , introduced or added to bring cross linking between polymer chains; nucleating agents , they basically added to increasing , increase the crystanality; dispersing agents which are used for dispersing some fillers in the polymer metrics; foaming and defoaming agents , which are added to make foamed polymer product.	11.030022669027488
We have seen earlier , we can put that value and we can get this expression.	7.4746427651426615
The only difference , lies by the virtue of the presence of a catalyst or an enzyme in this case , will be that you can reach to the equilibrium status much faster than in the case of an uncatalyzed reaction.	9.043363466105951
So , n 0 minus n is the number of monomer or moles of monomers reacted , divided by , n 0 is the total number of monomers the beginning , and each monomer has 2 functional group.	7.386328030547633
So , for dilute solution it can be mathematically shown that we can write the above expression like this where chi as you know chi is the solvent - solute interaction parameter , rho 2 is the density of the polymer molecule , m n is the number average molecular weight this c is the concentration , concentration in mass per unit volume.	10.173053246697823
This is probably one of the highest.	10.836551319628704
Now , what happens.	3.8614617857301274
Now , you can argue that you can mix this homopolymers or make a blend.	8.860720444892523
Particularly in case where you want to carry out reactions using insoluble substrates or soluble enzymes and want to use a continuous reactor.	9.667800584516193
If this r dot abstract a hydrogen from here , from neutral species r h , then you have this radical species generated.	10.50964945668436
The first method which is also a very commonly used method is ionotropic gelation in which the whole process of insolubilization of the polymer is based on ionic exchange.	11.499285847161314
There are no similarities except that there will be some homologies of the sequence of different amino acids in same nature of functional enzymes.	9.140193395627936
The active site is predominantly hydrophobic in nature.	9.450703993223133
And by doing , so they are always reshuffling between them self at the end you always have a completely random copolymer.	10.368917327873726
And , these are the some examples of organic light stabilizers.	8.192575042441737
So , this shows what we explain in just now.	7.349811994755274
That means they can act up on two or three different amino acids but most of them are very specific to a particular amino acid and they are produced and the dl - acyl amino acid can be hydrolyzed by the suitable enzyme which hydrolyzes or.	9.8114648174468
Whereas if i takes styrene and vinylether , again it can be polymerized by radical , but it cannot be polymerized , because this is , cannot be polymerized by anionic , in this case , it is cannot be polymerized by cationic , but it can be polymerized by cationic polymerization.	9.17654217639666
It will be expressed in the cyclic form by a triangle each enzyme species represented on the vertex of the triangle and each of the path way which should be considered for the formation of enzyme species must have n - 1 steps.	9.103114903982906
How do you form polymers.	8.46023831436207
Although the one and three are identical still it is able to exhibit the stereochemical specificity in terms of product formation.	10.187344367159396
Now , these expression is also throws up one more interesting conclusion that if say molecular rate is very high close to infinity then 1 by t c would be equals to theta or theta would be equals to t c.	9.145954081653414
Now , in this case , we are defining the dihedral angle is 0, dihedral angel is the angle between two planes , one plane is going through c 1, c 2, and c 3; so this plane 1, 2, 3, the plane going through this three carbon 1, 2, 3 that is one plane , and second plane is between 2, 3, and .	9.52308070120384
In those cases the change in the optimum temperature will be attributed to conformational effects only because there is no chance of any diffusional effects.	8.265349513193291
So , your polymer chain increases linearly and in this case it has , if it has to happen , it has to , the reactions which responsible for the chain termination of , by terminating the reactive in groups has to be absent in this case so that polymer can , polymer chain can increase linearly.	11.497319572677076
This amino group containing derivative can be used for immobilizing enzyme by any method which is applicable for amino group containing material.	10.842417535354896
If you plot this at a constant value of v just like in the first case when we take constant value of v , you will get a profile with b increasing at different constant value of v.	8.379555420365651
That means kappa value for e to es will be k1.s and this will be k - 1and you will notice that wherever a substrate or product species is involved you will multiply the rate constant with that.	10.11907787361945
Now , this cationic chain polymerization can be utilized to synthesize telechelic polymers as well , where telechelic term means , low molecular weight , typically less than 20k molecular weight with a functional group at end , which can be utilized for further reaction.	9.595524084364952
Similar situations can be looked from entrapment methods and finally the over riding factor often comes as cost.	10.851549574964748
That means binding process is facilitated.	9.938713599196879
So , the stability of this resulting propagating radical will be same.	7.588869281415823
Instead of giving you a straight line it becomes convexed to the x axis and it can meet.	10.928975284523503
Very often you notice that in experimental data you may not get a perfect point of intersection.	10.713139398554155
So , m dot is; this is the summation of the concentration of all the radicals present; all the propagating radicals present in the reaction medium.	7.985901310469732
Secondly , we must know the number of end groups per polymer chain.	7.369561369695161
So , we have three solutions with 3 data for 3 angles; so , 9 data points.	8.30648890339146
So , you target for 100 is always desirable that at the end of the reaction , you should get an average degrees of polymerization of 10.	6.989521416335493
In both cases , if you increase the volume molecular concentration of the monomer , the molecules weight as well as the rate of the polymerization increases , but when we try to do that , while that by carrying out the reaction is the bulk condition where you get a maximum concentration of the monomer.	10.499391420693803
This kind of kinetics if you look at v0 = k2 [ e ] 0 [ s ] / km + [ s ] you will also notice a very significant trend if you look at a graphical representation , saturation kinetics , represented by a rectangular hyperbola this is km , and this is vm / .	9.175801769763334
If you have pure ccl 4, obviously , this is more non - polar , dielectric constant is 2.3 and the rate is low.	9.937546806759839
So , you can now imagine how many possible isomers or isomeric form you can get by polymerization of this butadiene molecule 1, 3 butadiene molecule.	8.754188619639718
It could be a fermentation broth in most cases.	7.806996532370296
Enzyme is modified and second substrate attacks and then releases another product.	10.475388849690347
Now , what about the detected signal.	7.512285217010849
If you instead take a cycloid hexane , you take diethyl ether , increase the polarity of the medium keeping any other thing , then look at this; cis product is not that dominating now.	9.40952203528283
So , if i write this , then it , in general , it takes care of both the coupling reaction and the initiation.	8.30729770868393
So , this these are remember this at low conversion we are talking about reaction has just started.	9.386312617932017
So , if you talking about copolymerization the values r will change with the different types of initiators , medium polarity and temperature.	7.439982363209698
Let us just recap couple of minutes on the topics we covered in last lecture.	7.372337464501852
But even the residence time distribution can give you reasonably good idea of the non - ideality of the flow based on which one can even monitor the reactor performance and use that information particularly for scaling it up when you want to go on a larger scale reactor.	10.486218889281052
So , you can use 2 types of , 2 or 3 types of uv stabilizers.	8.213491066703424
If you assume that the reaction is towards zero order kinetics that means the initial substrate concentration used is high and fractional conversion will also be not very high.	9.853604912279845
So , if there is any chain transfer reaction , the actual value of x n bar will come down and c s and other c s , it could be a s , could be a monomer a solvent or a molecule , which are added from outside by deliberately or by , it present as impurities.	9.721958462388892
The effectiveness factor can be made to go towards one but in these cases you face other operational problems like at the low particle size there is a risk of high pressure drop across the bed resulting in more power consumption for operating the enzyme reactor.	9.441741467980927
But if you , if you want to stop the reaction for whatever reason , then you can add an agent , which could be alcohol or water , which can actually react with , immediately with these active anionic carboionic chain end and stop the reaction.	8.742749639128183
So , we talked about the initiator reaction with by this reaction of the monomers with the electrophile.	8.172313351084664
Let us consider the first one , the case of ehs that is the interaction of the eh with the substrate and we can write the concentration of ehs ehs = eh . s / km i am omitting the parenthesis to denote the concentration term.	11.256064583407456
Because we know that limit c tends to 0 eta sp by c is your intrinsic viscosity.	8.71267831713661
And if the polymers are soft then they will stick to each other.	6.870856774164359
So in intrinsic , these are the assumptions we are making that specific viscosity can be obtained by summing up the specific viscosity of the individual polymer chain.	8.911718675492885
So , the most used co - catalyst is mao which is a methylaluminoxane , which is network compound of this.	9.692353893700764
It has no effect on the binding of b and so it is independent of concentration of b in the reaction mixture.	9.67343806451042
Say , if i consider m as a monomer and i is a , initiation , initiator , then it could be a cation or an anion , which will , according to which we name cationic polymerization or anionic polymerization.	9.80132899211251
This equation will also allow you to calculate the value of k * and hence the value of activation energy during your earlier equation that is your e * e * = - rtlnk * if you use the equation number 6 and 2 you can calculate the value of energy of activation for a given system.	10.990702130972652
And the highest or the maximum intrinsic which is the in which the solvent in which the polymer gives , we the solubility parameter of the polymer is taken as the same solubility parameter of that particular solvent.	11.00670676472888
So , finally , this d p will even at this conversional rate actual d p will be lower than this 16, 8 and 4 or 2, i am just talking about the one simplistic case where following the simple reaction.	9.389644892303975
So , basically it is normalized , with the area , as well as the pressure difference across the flame thickness.	7.57872089830224
The ? t is indicated by a change in impedance and the range of temperature measurement for different enzymes lies in 0.004 to 1 degree centigrade.	9.799742417750124
The other example is like 2 2 di phanyl picryl hydrazyl dpph , when it reacts with this this is extremely it does not react with any monomer it reacts with the only radicals and form a non radical specious this benzo hydroquinone can react with a propagating radical.	9.715759023736709
That can give an indication that the enzyme catalyzed reaction is having some kind of a substrate.	8.990698505588194
And for solutions , we can do casting is applied to making films and spinning is applied to both from polymer melts or polymer solutions for example , making fibers.	12.143774590421652
The km value is modified to the true km k m = km ( 1 + h + / k ) the expression is analogous to that of competitive inhibition.	8.878057405979673
Thermodynamic factor is nothing but the stability of the forming cyclic rings.	11.567844834519422
There are various mechanisms and the net gain is sum total of the kind of mechanism that are involved in specific enzymes and in case of unimolecular reactions the entropic contribution may be quite insignificant.	10.332712634589006
When the come in the water vapour come in contact with this surface , they actual form a thin flame of water , which does not interfere with the light , such a way , that it basically gives any reduction in the visibility through this plastic material or it does not decrease the transparency of this plastic material.	10.19384702717312
Now just to complete the types of co copolymerization we have discussed in the last lecture.	7.056487066574367
Even for other forms of binding processes ph plays a key role and very often it has been noted that the binding by adsorption is maximum at its isoelectric points.	9.66152369441468
Similarly in the case of a fluidized bed reactor , we also have the same thing just to improve the mass transfer and heat transfer effects in the case of a reactor , the particles are fluidized by the substrate to the extent that the particles are not thrown out of the reactor; they are retained in the reactor but the voidage increases to a level that they remain fluidized in the reactor and even in this case in terms of flow behavior , the flow behavior will be some where in between the plug flow as well as the packed bed reactor.	9.335081368000427
Just like in the earlier automated devices you can have small immobilized enzyme columns and link it to the photometer.	11.494186211610973
And amorphous , which is hundred percent amorphous , zero percent crystalline region.	11.724276340835004
Now , these are these values here shown here these are all semi empirical values , they are not experimentally determined they are semi empirical values.	9.813026996854646
So , in normal time frame you can call those reactions absent , but during a longer time frame those reaction could be significant and then by that process , that termination , the chain could be terminated.	9.622943380967763
So , with the help of sans it was observed that the radius of gyration in a bulk amorphous polymer is similar as in case of theta solvent; so which was not possible to find out before the invention of this sans technique; sans technique help us to get information; both sans and saks get information in solid sate or in amorphous bulk state from which will give us the information about the polymer chain the dimension in bulk state; and if you compare the theta solvent , this is the first time after invention of sans it was found that the dimension of polymer chains are similar in case of theta solvent and in amorphous bulk solution.	10.178880355734023
Now that depends upon the temperature.	6.73162113484148
And , there is a partial ionization of these alkyl bridge and also polarization of this monomers , which produce this intermediate , which then form a six membered ring transition state; which basically form a six membered ring transition state.	8.249571672972253
Now , i have cross link here , here and there somewhere , somewhere like this , something like this , what is a molecular weight of this polymer.	9.480843508579408
And also join the you can join this spinodal points and you can also join the inflection points to get something like this.	8.816167392233588
So , this is t g here , drop in modulus and t m , drastic drastic drop in modulus in case of a semi crystalline polymer.	8.84605235842561
Now you think poly methylacrylate.	9.605552078277023
Instead of looking at the catalytic reaction in a homogenous phase where the catalyst is dissolved in the same medium as the reactant here the catalyst has a different phase - solid phase and the substrate is in the liquid phase.	10.806695741896753
I am drawing few changes here with different inks.	9.403420477884668
I am talking of the initial reaction rate as a function of temperature; not stability.	7.278210550268929
For a photo chemical initiation or photo initiation , r i is twice fie i a; i a is the intensity of the radiation , and fie is the quantum yield for initiation is similar to efficiency f for thermal initiation , this fie is the quantum yield for initiation.	8.843597651271146
You may recall that earlier we have outlined various ways of the mechanisms by which enzymes catalyze chemical reactions.	8.795125854463995
These multisite enzymes are alphabetic in nature which consists of more than one sub units and very often these subunits might be identical.	10.168842573961399
It is as a result of certain enzyme substrate interactions such that the rate gets tapered even before the saturation level reaches.	10.1448851219387
Then we need to look at the effect of fractional conversion and productivity; what is the desirable feature.	12.628719068306188
You can write as keq = [ p ] eq / [ s ] eq = k1 k2 / k - 1 k - 2 = vms . kp / ks . vmp one would like to understand the enzyme kinetics on the basis of the experimental data.	6.279055201820786
Now , in a polymer copolymer chain which will be favorable.	10.361279519887905
Weak binding in the sense while during use , the enzyme can also dissolve slowly over a long period of time and if the carrier characteristics are sturdy they can be regenerated and reused.	10.336026974060447
You don t really get a good solution.	9.449219274862893
Similarly in the case of most of the kinases , hexokinase , a typical example of the very first reaction in glycolysis , magnesium ions are absolutely required.	9.16490978360609
So , basically you can have one chain end with one active center and because of resonating structures , it can actually form another geometry around the double bond and now this propagates it will form a trans polymer , if this chain polymer , this chain propagates , it will be a cis product.	9.753345331160174
Therefore they are still acceptable and desirable because of other desirable property.	9.76575751343993
Yes . diethylaminoethylether has lot of amino groups with positively charged matrix and therefore the enzyme activity is reversed.	11.782489690280785
In many cases practical reactors may not be an ideal cstr or ideal pfr.	9.941442330139113
Now , that may not be sufficient for our purpose.	7.5162689570973855
But , time being glass transition is a temperature at which a polymer becomes soft below which polymer become glassy.	9.444271724581556
So , if you add the next monomer what would be the arrangement now.	7.170715704371633
Thermodynamic factor comes from the stability of the ring size.	10.137556121620062
In this case , you do not have those problems because you are doing in a solution then heat heat transfer can takes place efficiently because it is solution viscosity does not build up.	8.053411075541192
Other feature was people tend to accept the enzyme names very literally and in absolute sense.	10.810251853863212
So , good solvent chain expansion , the expansion factor is more than 1, if you have poor solvent chain contraction happened.	10.805227175579233
So , let us talk about tensile testing , what is done , you take a specimen something like this geometry , which is like a tumbleset geometry or we call dog bone geometry in a crude way.	10.015782041367736
That is if you plot 1 / q versus 1 / y you will get a linear plot and you will get the value of q0 and k.	9.483738130541015
They will undergo some termination reaction till the concentration of z dot is much higher at very beginning and this forms , this might undergo bimolecular termination reaction.	9.820057841968744
So , one more time if you have a initiator which reversibly form this r dot and z dot , where r dot is an active radical and z is inactive radical because of its structure , then what happen is only these undergo polymerization of propagation reaction and at the very beginning , the concentration of r dot is quite highest.	10.227882314805623
You have to write that out by applying a low pressure , that will affect in vacuum and high temperature and so that your reaction proceed towards the product side , towards the polymers side.	9.374558454306788
So , let us stop for this lecture , and i will start the discussion of polymer additive in the next lecture.	5.617499425666783
Now , why do we need to control a molecular weight of a step polymer.	7.666892392232962
How many number of radicals has initiated polymer chains , that 6 moles so that is 10.	12.140493060282596
If you are starting with two different oligomers and you are starting the reaction from there , at the end of the polymerization you will find that this chains are reshuffled and they have a uniform composition across.	8.669395527784458
The polymer sample on releasing the applied stress , it does not come back to the original state , there is a permanent deformation.	7.859480468927649
This following statistics was first done by flory.	12.436736381357175
If you have hydroxy acid , then it can form a cyclic product like the monomer.	8.052870282755363
So , the output signal in this detector is proportional to the concentration and if we assume that detector response is proportional to the concentration in the range we are working , and also this response does not depend on molecular weight.	8.5681077164844
There are another group of enzymes which are multisite.	10.97270080799125
So , you can have brass polymers and so on.	4.797405573464913
Now , between styrene radical the propagating radical from astyrene polymerization , vinyl acetate polymerization this is much more reactive compared to a styrene radical generated from styrene molecule.	9.110721496193515
Now we know that , or you can anticipate , that the properties; mainly mechanical properties of a polymer materials , which should increase with molecular weight.	9.957218314371142
So , unlike step growth polymerization here you have control you can control the molecular weight by the ratio of monomer and initiator.	10.197238255677808
So , we call this as a mesodyad.	6.719847792813843
The effect of temperature on reaction rate gives you a parameter activation energy and which is considered also to be a characteristic parameter for any chemical reaction and in the case of activation energy the major reason , the contributing factor is the diffusional limitations that is the rate of diffusion because as i mentioned that the diffusion process itself is highly sensitive to temperature and the activation energy in the case of immobilized enzyme preparation is a net resultant of the two temperature dependent processes the chemical reaction and the diffusion.	10.256565267367694
For example in the case of cstr the concentration of substrate in the reaction mixture is very , very low , same as in the outlet or in other way the concentration of product is very high in the reaction mixture.	8.468184183629202
So , basically , these , this irregularities are very less in the polymer chain , but the degradation is mainly caused by this irregularities itself , not the main polymer chain.	8.566360064024492
So , if you start a point here; obviously , this is a single phase system soluble , and then if you cool the temperature , what will happen.	7.7589592013388975
That means you take an enzyme solution or a substrate solution , add a quantity of soluble enzyme in a batch mode , provide the optimum temperature and ph , carry out the reaction and terminate the reaction by changing one of the operational parameter either by heating it or by drastic change of ph so that the reaction is terminated and then extract the product.	10.043037393561724
So , what would be the average molecular.	7.387358995715548
So , the efficiency of the radical initiator is decreased.	7.892769969527242
Because it has occupying some volume in the space , but in the model we did not consider , we considered that this space can be occupied by more than one bonds.	10.065551118687896
So , sum up 1609.5, so delta would be given by multiplied the density 1.19 and by the molar mass , mass of the repeating unit.	8.735791970000248
So , average per bench is 50 by 5, that is 1.	9.563850161237498
There is no restriction bond angle , or you can do it in a 3 d , i am just showing a 2 d matrix.	8.789053133671988
So , if i have for example , i talk about one participating transfer reaction it produce this radical.	7.857514161777611
We will see in a minute how the surface area is actually important for this catalyst and also it actually help in increase the activity of the polymerization.	9.181541256834498
The regulatory mechanisms involved in the bio synthesis of those enzyme proteins will also be understood through biology.	12.272510837714337
Now a radical propagating radical can react with the monomer , which corresponds to k p , rate of polymerization and it can react with a transfer agent , which is your rate constant for transfer reaction.	9.05242726679117
So , that is the assumption we are making that , all these rate constants are equal; and , so , we can write all the rate constant as k p , and m is there , and everywhere.	8.848046075417047
That means a comparison between the biochemical reaction rate and the rate of diffusion by the.	8.515895092505993
Let us consider x a as solvent so benzene cyclohexane , toluene , methyl benzene , isopropyl benzene and tertiary butyl benzene.	9.757011035610155
It remains very narrow as long as your initiation rate is much faster compared to propagations , so all the chains actually start.	10.10172321207808
You probably may not used that at higher temperature like 80 degree you might see failure , because of decrease in the modules of the material.	10.653519888864444
You read the kinetic rate expression and the individual rate constants if you want to really design and get the final simulated values and all other simulated profiles for the reactor performance.	9.632817105075794
The third category is hydrophobic binding where we predominantly use hydrophobic interactions on the surface of the carrier and the hydrophobic interactions on the surface of the enzyme protein.	6.713330574824203
So , basically this relates to the reactivity s of the two monomers and the electrostatic charge on the two monomers.	7.830866956661318
So , with this we come to end in this module of polymer synthesis.	6.898205674989895
The third factor we can think of is , back bone symmetry , and pendent group regularity.	9.685648909615313
What is the chemical constitution.	9.012545639912062
One is the solvent and the solute solution all the polymer solution should be absolutely dust free; otherwise , the dust particles will scatter light that will interfere and give error in the your final result.	9.989239456679524
In the zero order regime there is no difference.	6.258004622392593
So , i can make z minus 1; z z minus x minus 2 so that is x minus 1 and p x minus 1 and we know p is n 0 minus x i by n 0 that is x minus .	8.45208053547106
Now non - ideal solution of small molecules is invariably due to non - athermal mixing.	9.096436204629166
So , they are very fast and this fast nature of this reaction is due to the fact , that the accumulation of this active centers.	8.966006342584079
If it is this m n dot , which is the original propagations radical is more stabile , then obviously , this will be more preferred reaction over transfer reaction.	9.825000958992675
For example , if i have a butyl butylated hydroxy toluene , when this forms a radical where from a hydrogen you can am not writing you can imagine that the dot will come here.	7.695160659509859
So , number of b group reacted again.	7.419249833955428
And what we will do.	5.324995856298041
Now we also have seen during our discussion of chain polymerization synthesis that always it is the head - tail arrangement when polymer chain propagates.	10.343061452515943
There are many other smaller applications but these applications require the idea of methods of immobilization and their application for reactor design keeping in view the variety of issues that we have discussed in the past.	9.383309054559673
If you are by any means if you can reduce this m dot , then rt comes down.	7.099414343647453
We also know how p is related to time.	8.531241091261167
In that case we need to get i theta value at very low theta to know or to find out accurate information.	9.61510568806988
Now , we started discussing about the thermodynamic factor.	7.024242060392997
This is around 10 degree; this is only around 87 degree.	9.299434254378513
And i leave my email address , in case you need to contact , with a need for any reason.	12.038957147341055
Now , let us first talk about polymer additives , which work in polymer air interface , first let us talk about additives , anti - fog or anti - fogging agents.	7.9218892924552415
So , if you find one , the other would be , you can get easily from that expression which both connects each other.	8.184184776865663
So , this becomes 1..	9.572579376862288
They have put an enzyme solution in an ultra filtration membrane or cellophane membrane or you can say dialysis bed which is closed at the bottom and the electrode is dipped into it.	10.193229711317368
When n is large , of course r is the end to end distance much lower than nl , we have this equals to , we have this expression for this , we have this where beta is . .. . . now , here we are considering one unit volume , in this place.	11.028549079476605
Now , we know that in mass spectroscopy which basically involve the study of mass of an ions and created by ionization of fragmentation , and then determine the electrically at the gas phase.	9.076729801240537
So , in real chain the rms end - to - end distance is actually higher than the unperturbed unperturbed dimension , when we did not consider the excluded volume effect.	7.32862422337539
The contact ion - pair gets separated and this process , by this process the ion individual ions gets solvated and as a result , its exothermic process.	10.10886252425045
They could be , for example amino groups of lysine , terminal amino groups , thiol groups of cystein , carboxyl groups of aspartic or glutamic acid , carboxyl terminal groups , phenolic group of tyrosine , hydroxyl group of serine or threonine , it could be inert imidazole group of histidine.	10.694021333001334
And you have n 1 is the number of solvent molecule and n 2 is the number of solute molecules and n 0 is n 1 plus n 2 which is the total number of molecules.	8.325349562339754
Now , at steady state you can equate r i n r t to get the concentrate , concentration of like , in case of , we have a similar approach in case of radical chain polymerization , so we get this.	10.149603297161512
So , what are the requirements for a successful inter polymerization interfacial polymerization you need to have a inorganic base , which you require to neutralize the produce hcl otherwise hcl with go back and hydrolyze the salt.	9.412260918139635
Strength , is the load , is the sustain it is the ability to sustain dead load so , basically ultimate strain is the stress it it can capture or it can hold before it breaks and yield stress , yield strength is basically the stress , you it can it can take up before it yields.	12.42589512093267
Just coming in proximity could provide you an effect what we discussed like high substrate concentration in the proximity of the active site but does not explain you how the energy of activation is induced.	9.794864912034832
So , obviously the end - to - end distance would be more closer to this , compared to this; and if there was no restriction , for a free rotation it would have been somewhere in the middle.	8.036604314897726
So , to generalize , let us try to find what the probability of finding a chain in the reaction medium with the x bar is.	8.96782110044788
And obviously , what is advantage here.	11.752243066703585
Or alternatively we take a water soluble polymer large molecular weight substance and mix the enzyme solution with this and the mixture is subjected to conditions by which the insolublisation takes place.	10.597259299423024
Such situations are very rare as far as the unisubstrate reactions are concerned.	9.877833842526325
This is dissolved in a non - polar solvent like chloroform or carbon tetrachloride , methylenechloride and this organic solution of cellulose triacetate is then emulsified with the aqueous enzyme solution.	9.00244033005489
In the case of chemical catalyst a single catalyst may catalyze a large variety of similar reactions.	6.884087810294055
Obviously , we know that with increasing crystalinity , the modulus and strength goes up , whereas with a if we cross link this material with cross linking , the modulus goes up.	8.288001290241487
So , we will consider the same reaction here in this reaction and in this case , which will come the h .	9.307508679633012
So , we get highly coiled chains.	6.917507570610407
The fourth thing is that the ratio of k2 / km which you will recall from the basic definition of this parameter which is specificity constant or a pseudo first order rate constant for the enzyme catalyzed reaction k2 / km is small which refers to slow catalysis.	9.484171019964203
The initial reaction rate is the basic philosophy in determining the enzyme concentration.	9.384350380083902
So , this stability would be similar to stability of this radical.	6.558280920775494
The cost of the product is not very high so productivity becomes very important parameter.	7.5049963417948735
In some of the examples in this table you will notice that on the first column you have side chain serine , cysteine , histidine , lysine , aspartic acid and glutamic acid.	8.092060260668433
We put a tracer input signal or what we call as a stimulus.	9.857159157089212
Then the next substrate interacts and the next product is released.	8.895682621187017
And then we also learnt molecular distribution among the chains which are formed in step polymerization , and then calculate mw and poly dispersed index and then at the end , we will compare between cyclization and linear polymerization.	9.30647104943666
Earlier we talked about the analysis of the bi - substrate data based on the double reciprocal plot and the secondary plots of the slope and intercepts.	11.116951074619225
This is what it does.	6.884025875458872
Weights are more significant than numbers.	14.086577682519744
So , the molecular weight of ring opening polymerization is dependent on the conversion.	6.568433825142386
So , we will deal , we will discuss only about random coil , not about the other two confirmations of polymer molecules.	8.32941741548422
That means whether particle is a sphere or a chip or a cylindrical pallet or whatever be the shape , it varies; the relationship between the effectiveness factor and the thiele modulus.	9.254562020467889
This comes out of the product and the enzyme and the unconverted substrate remains in the retentate.	12.653081955993652
And when this is new radical is formed , this initiate a another new chain polymerization , with rate polymerization rate of rate constant k a.	10.409312742286508
But still on commercial level amperometric and potentiometric transducers are the common tools that are used in bulk.	10.176792714079687
It s a very fast enzyme the specific activity is very high and therefore the enzyme very speedily converts the gel into a liquefied starch.	9.205535393562451
So , if you plot delta m versus x 2 you get the slope as delta mu 2 minus delta mu 1 and the intercept will be at x regard to 0, delta mu 1 and at x 2 is equal to 1 we will get delta mu two till the intercepts , intercept at x 2 is equal to 0 and x 2 is equal to .	8.296510150010306
So , from that we can find the m dot as r i by k t , to the power half.	6.193763598851569
So , it is essentially alternate copolymer with some random incorporation of , or statistically incorporation of m 1, because in that case , where some tendency to homo polymer , m 1, because r 1 is higher than zero; that is not exclusively participate in cross propagation , this sometime can participating homopolymers , homopropogation , so you will get essentially a alternate copolymer , but some cases will , some incorporation of m .	9.991627718611133
On the other hand in the sigmoidal kinetics instead of a reaction profile being represented by rectangular hyperbola it is in the form of a sigma.	7.725720223993649
So , the same same structure , same polymers sometimes can be named in a different way you know.	7.988432354320617
If you consider further , 20, 80, 7 and this is 3.2, 3.2, 0, 100, 9.72 and this is .	13.334975593119395
And , a summation of all the other terms , m 1 dot , m 2 dot , m 3 dot , m n dot.	8.547792521428482
We consider rate of polymerization as the rate of propagation altogether.	14.567875576408788
So , we need to convert this to this type of expression.	6.7083612725576796
Now , let us first consider the simplistic , very simple model where you have freely jointed chain with no restriction.	8.536796920249145
There are limited names we actually used for all the times , and commercially also if you want to , or the homo polymers which are used in large scale , they are very limited.	10.848381523496501
So , it is always preferred , that you take out as much as condensate as possible by your system , by your technique and also , you also design the monomers , so that reactivity is higher and so the equilibrium constant is higher.	8.766950734281629
That means , the byproducts also take part in the reverse reaction and the chains intermediate chains also take part reactions with exchange reaction between them.	8.06492022421246
So , these are , the initiation step is actually consist of 2 short steps - 1 and .	8.91174724708971
The conformation resulting from the forces of these interactions that take place are usually classified into four categories.	10.683705692919354
That means some of the functional groups of the monomer and the enzyme have to be common so that in the polymeric network at some places instead of the monomer unit the enzyme is inserted and you get a polymeric mass which contains enzyme molecules distributed in the polymeric network in that kind of method.	10.902409559341475
We can increase the rate of termination reaction; and , that is done by addition of hindered amines.	10.653065581050592
And then talk about briefly about the practical aspects of anionic chain polymerization and then we will start this chain copolymerization , which i will continue in the next lecture as well.	7.688500291091687
Now as i said that we are going to learn polymers in solutions or polymer solution.	7.409394195167211
L and therefore f is less than one which means the reaction is under diffusional control regime.	12.229093848221753
Similarly you can form this and this.	6.6966990074693715
So , this is the linear region where the polymers get separated.	7.051143153833041
Now we just got the expression for m v which is given here which is the expression for m v.	9.403458909079378
As we discussed for branched polymer if you compare between linear and a branched polymer from same molecular weight , the branch will have more compact volume.	10.278049414243267
This is what is found in practice when you inject different molecular weight or sample in the gpc column we do actually see that the elution volumes becomes decreases linearly with log m.	9.782304933377366
This definition takes care of the three major factors one is the localization of the enzyme or connectivity over a major substrate and such an immobilization can be achieved by different means.	11.660587809205573
You can see the change in the behavior on the relationship between the enzyme loading and the enzyme reaction rate.	8.798141209535046
Some trade names are mentioned here.	10.196045612116366
In this case we have weight fraction multiplied by the molecular weight of the individual fractions.	7.135186639175457
That reaction is very slow and we have talked about these equations several times and the rate of polymerization and the kinetic chain length which is related to the molecular weight or number of decreases the polymerization.	8.897095605873107
Then another area where probably cost or the process of economics is not important is the medical or therapeutic applications where the effectiveness is a very important aspect and in many cases even immobilized enzymes have found way in medical or therapeutic applications.	9.685464359517754
And look at these peaks , this are for the these 3 hydrogen present here in the monomer 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 3, 3 peaks for the polymer 3 olefinic hydrogen present in the monomer.	10.81684092947577
And if you are doing in a solution , you are doing this poly step polymerization reaction solution , then you can also try and change the solvent.	8.705216011244765
The enzymes that are physically confined or localized in a defined region of a space with retention of their catalytic activity and which can be used repeatedly or continuously in a process are usually considered as the immobilization enzyme preparations.	7.468544115966697
That means the fraction which you are interested is distributed over a period of time.	6.232223277845522
They have taken in a nonpolar solvent and they have mixed; now it produces a titanium trichloride and this.	9.284755404197668
So , obviously , the elution volume will defer according to size.	7.185963665842312
While we are considering all other conditions of the isothermal operation or partitioning effect , diffusional limitations are still valid.	10.54817140163153
In the step polymerization we have seen that we need , at least two functional groups , so that the reaction can happen between the functional groups , but in case of chain polymerization , we need one functional group , mono functional group , in most cases it is a double bond.	9.85849609385673
Now , high temperature reaction is not only to increase the reactivities in or the equilibrium constant of the reaction , but also if you want to remove , if somebody wants to remove the bi product like say water in polyester formation or say example , a water formation water form polyester formation to take out the water you have to increase the temperature high and put a high vacuum so that you can take out the water from the system which will give you the equilibration towards product side towards right hand side which will lead to formation of polymer molecules.	9.39350750325735
Let us assume that we are given some solution for the first order reactions.	7.911471340856492
So , the real dimension of polymer chain becomes same as the dimensionless unperturbed that chain; that means it is not perturbed by any other polymer or solvent.	8.897834413606386
The first enzyme in the whole reaction sequence was invertase which hydrolyses sucrose into glucose and fructose and that was essentially the a key enzyme which people were ready to study.	10.360922981468939
Basically that signifies that the dynamics of the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate molecule may be quite varied unlike in the case of michaelis menten kinetics where you have a single substrate and it has to bind on the active site of the enzyme molecule and form an enzyme substrate complex.	9.256741917318752
They can source the monomer at any stage , they can buy bpa and phosgene , they can buy phenol and make bpa them self or they can buy a cumin and they make and they can phenol from which they can make bpa and and then pc.	10.81470543497007
Now , in this case they basically above this line , and other one lies below this line , so we are telling this is a dihedron angle of 0 degree , and in this case obviously , dihedron angle of 180 degree.	9.661370831377436
If you look at the two reactions that i referred to earlier that is conversion of fumaric acid to malic acids and also maleic acid to aspartic acid.	7.481379022493958
Then there will be a difference in the refractive index , within the media and those portions that just now i mentioned , there will be scattering , took to scattering to happen the two conditions has to meet; one they should be difference in i ri refractive index between the scatter and the medium.	8.801812616244284
So , as hildebrand suggests that that compatibility between components one which is the solvent and two which is the solute the polymer in this case arises , as you have the less differences between the solubility parameter of the two components.	11.568577311110857
And the resistance of the polymer , to varies chemicals depend on number of criteria s.	10.05559098225761
Now , hydride elimination is not very easy thing.	9.196176776819645
Then in that case radioactive material could be also used as tracers so that they can be monitored at the exit stream by measurement of simple radioactivity by the counters.	10.778750655171056
Now , we will have to add a factor k , the k is 1 for case of initiation , where each initiator molecules forming one chain , like butyl lithium case , organ butyl lithium case , where each initiator molecules are actually forming one chain.	8.724774933756875
And , at normal temperature , the temperature we work in the lab , del h is highly negative which makes del g is based on .	10.577867218912436
You end up in a three dimensional network which is water insoluble and in the form of a block.	8.707296196719561
Those molecules whose presence in a reaction mixture influences the rate of reaction , if it is in increasing the rate of reaction we call them as activators if it is decreasing the reaction rate , we call them inhibitors.	11.758721740693307
That means the enzyme molecules are entrapped within a definite region of a space; it could be a lattice of a polymeric matrix or a semi permeable membrane.	7.98588700055597
Now , let us take an example of methyl methacrylate.	3.8573825787787763
But in case there is deviation one will find quite different values and the actual reactor performance will be judged by the reactor performance based on the distribution and kinetics.	9.382890380957779
What is the shape of the reactor.	10.204062170999817
You make , as we have discussed several times in last lecture , that you can utilize this end and if you have , add a next second monomer , you actually make block copolymer as well.	9.946682083125426
So , the value of t g becomes steady value.	5.455736531128235
So , the solubility of polycarbonate is a very low , but it s is not zero in acetone.	11.404456713318307
So , x n is 2 by instead of 1 by 1 p is 2 by 1 p and x w is 2 plus p 1 minus p.	7.875464573431559
If there is any absorption of some tracer into the system or some reaction taking place or if the tracer is not a good choice that means either it is participating in the reaction.	9.052625814353295
If we can find the probability of all x or x mar , then we can surely get the distribution.	9.152815221245314
And then we discussed how a monomer structures determines it is feasibility towards undergoing polymerization , polymerization reactions towards a initiator , different kind of initiator radical cationic or anionic.	9.553446157881119
For example if you have covalently bound an enzyme i . e. , by covalent bond depending on the method of binding if you have not involved a spacer arm the loss will remain there.	10.24696877974809
That means you don t start with the functionalized polymer.	7.3810583393798215
It has poor weatheribility , it absorbs uv light and becomes yellow and it is soluble in hydrocarbon solvents.	10.830690551533362
Now we can apply the study state , where the rate of change of m 1 star is zero; like we discussed in the case of our chain polymerization , at the steady state the concentration of m 1 and m 2 star remains constant , so rate of change is actually zero at steady state.	9.745495878134134
So , you can imagine that you have to at least have a reaction temperature of 180, so that you can take out the phenol vapor from the system.	7.0347393261741145
The other modified form is a packed bed reactor particularly when we are talking of immobilized enzymes and the enzyme now in the form of either spherical particles , globules , chips , membranes then can be packed into a column and make a packed bed and the reactor can be operated in a batch mode in the total recycle.	10.036902704177638
In the case of pfr the expression is arrived xs0 ( 1 - km / k'p ) - km ln ( 1 - x ) [ 1 + s0 / k'p ] + s20x2 / 2k'p = k2e.	8.055443246586503
So that will represent the e0 or you can write e will be equal to e0 multiplied by the terms in the numerator.	11.746006290012613
One other example is anti microbial , where basically there is some devices , which are used by many people like a computer mouse of the using , may have been used by somebody else.	10.547807910837866
So , then you do not know the m v.	7.128172163672393
This accepts only glucose as a substrate and phosphorylate to gluco - 6 - phosphate.	8.896069993425714
The other one is on the use of aspergillus for leukemia patients.	10.611160817538552
If you have a digit backbone , digit group in the backbone , then t g goes up , as a result of increase stiffness.	7.844589489373685
This concentration of the reactant at the active site will be many fold higher compared to the actual concentration in the bulk phase in the aqueous medium in which the substrates are dissolved.	11.465608573828742
These are the most common example of or the most important initiation reaction.	8.12626497410644
Now , this gives the behavior of the or the how the gibbs energy of mixing per segment varies with , say one of the say compositions in this pie 2, pie 1 can be converted into pie , pie 2 easily see if you plot say del g mixing.	9.74693423904107
So , in general , we can write rate of chain transfer is rate constant for transfer m dot x a , now there could be 4 possibilities 4 possibilities , this is the rate constant for the transfer reaction.	8.087356301911603
So , we mostly delete semi - crystalline polymer , which is basically partly crystalline and partly amorphous.	9.560807397343801
So , it is like rubber.	6.874834318948611
The next category is diagnostic.	11.4597893329975
So now , we know k is intrinsic viscosity is m v by a.	9.222430431488439
It will clarify more.	8.646568682846969
So , the expansion would be much higher in that compared to a region , where the segment of polymer chain density is lower.	9.427968501590746
So , if the if the reaction between the one monomer with the phosgene is faster , then it will be a blocky copolymer.	8.899295723061277
Students should not confuse , should not equate the terms with addition polymers with chain polymers or condensation polymers with step - polymers.	10.767658837000258
So , you can expect a linear relationship.	7.263654319550099
So , a sample , which burn from less time , and which also does not ignite the inflammable material like cotton , present in the bottom of the container , they actually gives the best ranking.	10.762989608493196
The cost is reduced significantly and that is bottom shaded portion and that is because of the increase in yield.	11.590564070687778
The whole range of chemical reactions or bio chemical reactions that take place in a living cell are mediated by these different classes.	8.427441367456453
P is a probability that a propagating radical will continue to propagate that means continue to react with monomer.	10.141291189370017
L , when.	10.763020644937564
But when we talk of allosteric enzyme we are talking of a favorable interaction.	8.815629053409188
I have given you some idea about the introductory remarks on the enzyme as process biocatalyst.	11.401337530020088
Similarly , if you use very high polar solvents , like hydroxylated solvents or ketone , then the reaction actually gets stopped by reaction of these solvent molecules with the reactive species.	9.423884653896842
Classifications can be done.	17.253797140958593
When we talked about the ratio of two substrate concentration for two levels of reaction velocity the smaller it is , it is a better regulatory system.	10.124238854889313
So , if it this goes down t c also goes down.	5.9437024992617244
Now how are we going to add this polymer segments.	9.448431412278346
There is no other , there is no , no other alternate rules by which we can achieve p very high , close to 1 without , you know , keeping the reaction for a longer time; there is no other rules.	10.298176443468934
That has been supported by o rings just like we have put a sleeve in the earlier case.	10.062516861960551
Now , look at another composition here any point here between this and this point any point in this curve , this is the tie line.	9.621569187687783
Now , in case of electro - transfer initiation , 2, remember , that the sodium - naphthalene case , actually 2 initiator molecules are forming 1 chain , so you have to multiply a factor 2 for that.	9.15106153860001
So , the concentration of this propagating radical is given by k i cu 2 plus k i plus k i cu plus by cu 2 plus i is r br.	8.379091014594735
So , that no dust particle goes in here you inject sample basically sample goes in the column you can have one or more columns connected in a series , and the polymer sample gets separated according to their size hydrodynamic volume in this columns , and when they come out you have a detector which detect the polymer molecules , and with the help of computer you can analyze this data.	10.231136131452635
Then , the viscosity of the medium goes , you know increases quite a lot and when the viscosity goes up , this small molecular condensate diffusion of the condensate becomes very slow.	10.02388771903068
So , different types of test possible namely , charpy , notched izod , falling dart , tensile and and drop test and they are basically different and different types of test.	10.169652055891635
H . so those which have slightly higher.	12.186269988334928
In the case of immobilized cells initial autolysis of the cell releases some enzyme and then the enzyme remains entrapped and shows normal first order decay.	8.396345314714674
So , that is why this is this approach is not valid for crystalline polymers this is added already for amorphous polymer.	6.92972202712312
The monomer consistent drops as well as the initiator concentration drop.	10.391659331359058
So , basically , they capture or trap the radical produced; and , by doing this , they basically reduce the oxidation process; and , the only drawback is that they sometimes form a coloured compound , in doing that.	8.97862652952004
Higher this change is the system can be more effective usually it has been noted that only those enzymes which can generate a temperature change more than 0.1 centigrade are effective.	10.777722664089904
The slope also means the apparent km.	8.471906409213588
So , these are basically block copolymers , which have a long sequence of two different monomers.	7.190453622357603
So , if you plot log of intrinsic viscosity with log of viscosity average molecular weight , the intercept will give you log k and the slope will give you a.	8.17760715393153
So when you feed a substrate the pressure drop will be very large if the particle size is very fine.	10.73892052112104
So , in this case , both sides are amine group.	5.565712021434275
After time zero as soon as you put in the tracer , there will be a dilution or mixing taking place and the tracer will get diluted and from zero concentration it will come to a concentration finally all the tracer will come out.	10.518304357747194
Now , this is we know that in a molecule , in a molecule not every nuclei experience same amount of field basically , in surrounding a nucleus there is there are electron clouds , which basically seals some of the external magnetic field applied.	10.39368804515218
So , we can write rate of polymerization divided by rate of initiation , now at steady state we knew that we know by this time , that r i is equals to the rate of termination.	8.210411960103238
So , obviously drop in entropy will be much higher , these are negative numbers.	10.012697424844557
In the case of ph and temperature the effects are multidimensional.	7.953567579822471
Within the reverse micelle the amphipathic molecules make a structure where by all the hydrophobic tails extrude outwards towards the bulk organic solvent and the polar heads are all made into a small network within which the enzyme particle is trapped and some water is also entrapped within the cell and therefore the enzyme remains stable almost as if it is experiencing an aqueous phase.	10.965605640013676
Kf if this sb / j is the main flux taking into account both external film diffusion as well as internal pore diffusion and the first factor 1 / kl is resistance provided by external film diffusion and the second expression is a resistance term due to pore diffusional limitations then the overall effect is a sum of these two resistances and sb / j will be the flux which will really be expressed in the case of a reactor performance which experiences both film diffusion as well as internal pore diffusion.	9.877476512260712
So , higher is the refractive index , lower is the maximum transparency , one can get , when a light pass through a polymeric material , but you one can never get this high amount of transparence through a polymeric material , because there will be some in homogeneity in the refractive index the medium , even this for a homo polymer , and that will cause some amount of loss of flask of , the incoming light or transmitted light , due to scattering.	10.168466352930874
X bar means x n is x x bar.	12.830144703527877
So , if you suppress the toxic gas generation , for first few minutes , then in case of emergency , people can go out of the situation , and survive.	10.26100285382939
Here also you will notice that the concentration of e will be e = e0 ( k1.k - 2s + k - 2.k - 3p + k1.k3s ) in the same fashion for et it will come out to be k - 3.p and k2, k1s . k2 and k - .	8.994041561706384
If you go back here , each polymer segment , if all of these are , say for argument , all these neighboring cells has solvent molecules , and then it will have z contacts.	11.474954595840108
The last phase of today s lecture will cover on course outline and references and the course will broadly cover these aspects.	9.703565340128469
So , basically that combine , we call that weatharability basically , when some polymer , or some plastic material is applied , we find weather ability.	9.365584218281292
They used controlled pore glass and immobilized it with glucose oxidase and measured the reactor performance with different particles sizes , the value of effectiveness factor based on the experimental data that means by taking the ratio of the actual reaction rate for a particular particle diameter divided by the reaction rate at which particularly with a very small particle size say thirty microns.	11.956625208882098
If you just simplify it , you will get km ln s0 / s + s0 - s = k2.e0.t again i like to repeat that in case if we are using a batch reactor for immobilized enzymes we should replace km and k2 by prime terms.	10.209483577039341
Now , let us talk about the effect of structure monomer structure on reactivities or reactivity ratios.	5.699497607264101
So , these are the typical application , where we test for chemical resistance.	7.329341348769317
N 0 multiplied by f average because f average is number of functional groups present per molecule on average.	10.294213050340806
So , while if you apply stress it will deform , if you release the stress it should come back in the same path , stressed and come original state then , we called this is a linear this is elastic deformation.	10.963784545508332
Now , remember we talked about the effect of pressure briefly that in that reaction , in the polymerization reaction , if the volume change is higher , then it is increasing pressure.	9.325072509372118
Finally the type of inhibitor also influences the ultimate degree of inhibition.	9.297316118075825
How do we achieve is m dot is very low , then what is r p.	9.46731389773607
It cannot determine more than that because if we increase weight further , then the osmotic pressure becomes very small.	11.868991403893082
That is why this copolymers are not usually synthesized by doing ionic copolymerization from a mixture of two or more monomers.	8.495075919573724
A very significant property of apparent change in the enzyme optimum ph has bee used by immobilizing those enzymes to a positively charged matrix.	9.843405113616127
Similarly when a tends to infinity analogous expression will emerge v0 = vm . b / kb + b so you get a similar expression in the case of excess concentration of or large concentration of one of the reactants and that was also the understanding we had when we discussed michaelis menten kinetics.	10.221702416372862
Now what happen to a perfect.	10.366998035012319
When this is c h 3, if you have c h 3 group , the polymer chain becomes more stiffer.	13.074271956423239
Now we will talk the other properties , and again we will not go into very detail description of these properties , and how it is evaluated.	10.406380256878366
The bulk of the applications or in the bulk of the cases of enzymes we will look at microbial systems.	10.036062665077303
If p is the conversion probability of one free a group is 1 minus p , means unreacted probability of one free a group.	8.242769333480119
Now , r p which is the disappears of the monomer or reaction of monomer from the reaction medium , you can directly determined the monomers consideration by talking a alicot from the reaction medium.	9.29704265420329
So , there is a transfer happening between the extraction is happening between two groups , which means that if the reaction proceed through thermo dynamical control , if the reaction is thermodynamically control controlled.	9.783722394159357
These reactions could be hydrolysis could be polymerization , could be epoxidation , could be reduction and so on.	8.952211362524292
After one cycle when 72 % of the activity was lost they stopped the reactor; added more enzymes whatever loss has taken place 28 % enzyme was additionally added and it accumulated so that the enzyme reaches to the original loading capacity.	11.584234741519285
And this is having great practical significance which helps us to find out the group , functional groups or the conjugation present in the molecule.	9.660566341824303
You consider the entire reaction mixture is the polymer , which includes monomers dimmer oligomers and high polymers high molecular weight polymers.	9.771944957801576
So , if you take a monomer , a polymerization mixture , the end of the things maximum number will be present at the monomers , then dinomers , then trinomers and so on.	8.254643585114268
As a result the monomer composition in the medium , in the reaction medium , will be different than the beginning.	8.205540921281138
The choice of the method will again depend upon the carrier cost and the chemicals involved in the immobilization method and one of the disadvantageous part is that usually the carriers here cannot be regenerated.	10.819778564717046
The same thing applies to automation.	10.403353920192027
The frequency at which bonds in a transition state complex will break will be determined by these factors which can be obtained by equating the energy of an oscillator by two treatments.	11.774129269408636
In the second case we can also have that enzymes binds the substrate a and b and forms a enzyme substrate complex eab.	10.39989304443398
While michaelis - menten kinetics is the most accepted kinetic pattern of the enzyme catalyzed reaction , most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions in practice deviate from the basic assumptions and only under certain set of conditions they obey the enzyme kinetics proposed by michaelis - menten or briggs and haldane.	9.674822105811355
This synthesis is inhibited by this inhibitor.	11.144685750314194
What happened to the polymer getting exposed environmental situation; for example , polymers will come across different chemicals , if you talking about a medical devices , doctors or medical persons , always apply some rectifies spirit , ethanol to disinfect , so your material has to survive , so that has to be chemical resistance of the chemical , medical professions are using.	11.604790629639545
This is substrate concentration.	6.3833414861386295
Now , what is the mechanism what is the mechanism by which these polymerization happen and all the stereostacticity is maintained.	8.652249602410997
If you analyze the output stream over a period of time and let us say you get such a profile and where this profile interms of the c which is output concentration at any given time t divided by the total quantity which has been fed in a normalized way and that is c bar and c / q is the normalized concentration of the tracer output in the exit stream and the c / q verses t gives you a c curve.	10.07471510413842
I would like to introduce you to another method involving the use of cyanogen bromide not only from the point of view of preparing the immobilized enzyme preparation but it also has an additional property that is the cyanogen bromide method is used in the case of carriers that have hydroxyl groups.	9.905796030709794
You are right saying that the acidic carbon atoms at the end which has one of the functional group associated instead of a polymer chain , this should be chiral and show some activity but their concentration in the polymer is so low that in practically they do not contribute any optical activity or you do not see.	11.926030560937093
So , what to do to get the information about the polymer molecules or the solute molecules , we deduct the scattering from the solution from the solvent to get the excess scattering; we will explain the terms r in the next page.	8.618331966528105
The practical utility is two things.	9.453331165529896
There are certain classical examples of amylases , glucoisomerase , cellulase , lipase , proteases , which are the enzymes that are produced in bulk and are available in large quantity.	9.406847800172761
So , each polymer has how many contacts.	7.86232371209469
This loss of entropy has to be provided in terms of the energy of activation.	8.15469557389968
They only lead to formation of the two products in a sequential manner.	11.203433618914064
I am not interested to give you detailed chemistry.	10.468793818282013
Therefore he mentioned that the rate of break down of e - s and rate of formation of e - s are probably the same and e - s remains under steady state.	9.187879062788266
Now , if you remember from the last lecture that in in case of chain growth polymers , the monomers are not started the polymerization reaction by itself , you need to have external agent which will initiate the polymer chain and once the chain starts , monomer can add one after one and thus completing the chain quickly.	10.456283991218914
Now , they can they can in general term rule of thumb is that , if the i is i has some value than 2 n plus 1 is the numbers of states , they can basically , they have the number of states levels , energy levels , magnetic energy levels.	11.664345121012085
Activity . in the third one , there are two steps in decay.	13.892118727662414
At these two sites they can freely rotate.	12.150407250333961
Now , if we note , we define conversion or if conversion is p , now , how do you define conversion p.	8.06247176903316
If they can make biodegradable that is , fine.	10.212461842159469
For the first order kinetics this is the effectiveness factor as we discussed earlier.	10.674789808767965
That means the bulk substrate has to diffuse through the stationary film which is on the surface of the particle.	7.136394510374495
Fifthly another important pattern is for each class of inhibition , there is degree of inhibition.	11.408893443133287
Now , if i write this poly ethylene oxide this might give you different structure depending upon how do you represent this molecule.	8.069293250970551
This probably gives you an idea that this is a very broad non - specific method.	11.348919386273774
If there is only aa plus bb tied molecule and obviously , f average 2, when that can only happen when p is .	9.650449122697967
For example , because your concentration is very high even at low concentration even at low conversion the viscosity goes up because the medium viscous if the polymer is viscosity goes up.	8.848859496985432
One can determine these values from the kinetic analysis and one can get the picture of specificity.	10.431950143689901
These are the steps for protein synthesis and in case of enzyme synthesis also the same principle applies.	10.151513244259421
Polymers can be classified according to the monomer compositions.	9.65014443356071
Now , all these factors actually contribute to the reactivity of the monomer in such a way that it is very difficult to distinguish , the contribution from each of these factors in the reactivity of the monomers.	8.101006767627347
Here , you have both r 1 and r 2 greater than .	8.88629856864007
This is very stable.	6.9872582368557286
Now , what are the assumption if did use this expression r p his k p a m , what are the assumption we made one was that initiation was slow , propagation his fast and termination was even faster.	8.58266130820265
We identify that e can be formed by this and this.	8.196244288249318
The upper root is uncatalyzed.	13.366791471116148
And in opaque applications , there are other properties like gloss , reflectance , yellowness index and so many things , surface roughness.	10.570842952863039
Vm here is the maximum reaction velocity when all the binding sites are occupied by the substrate.	8.588878222831607
We will probably talk when we will come to the actual kinetic aspects.	9.108173058365214
There is no continuous output or input in the system and the conversion is given by the rate of reaction.	8.054419048128745
It is a simple arithmetic mean so m n would be total mass or weight by total number of moles.	8.900127698929381
That is the relative quantity will keep on reducing if the shift is from first order to zero order ultimately it will reach to same quantity.	9.179182855666514
For example what is the kappa product for this pathway.	12.7508203146016
Because each enzyme has specificity towards one of the isomers , substrates can be resolved into respective isomers.	11.490625491334804
Now this same polyamide having polyamide having same molecular structure , molecular formula , we can get it from ring - opening polymerization of caprolcatam.	10.036774110585293
It has a very peculiar property which is really carried forward in the function and structure of the enzyme molecules.	9.743957614363136
These two profiles have identical reaction velocity at high substrate concentration.	7.5579918093678495
Now if the reaction continues the , this value changes and is actually it is become higher because the drop in as i said drop in initiator concentration is much faster compared to drop in monomer concentration.	9.119802096035665
So , the total number of ways the polymers can be placed in the 3d lattice will be given by w 1 w 2 w 3 w i n .	6.762794849195153
If r 1, or it could be r 1 and r 2 both are near to zero.	7.841403223123643
Now , typically e transfer is higher than e p , so which means , that with t , with increase in , decrease in temperature c also goes down , which means , x n goes up.	9.106680839399322
Remember in case of bimetallic , the growing polymer chain was attached to the aluminum metal.	12.270255552457213
Reduced activity means that the protein content will be reduced.	13.31126968481455
The specificity must be looked in from both the angle and in many cases today people are applying the development of molecular biology particularly in sense of protein engineering to modify the substrate specificity both when we want the absence of side products to make it more specific as well as when we want broad specificity so that the same enzyme can be applied to a large variety of substrates.	10.700187110599595
If your k is low , then you have to make sure that you takeout the water molecules as much as possible.	7.466284321603984
In non - competitive inhibition we considered the binding of the inhibitor to either the substrate or the free enzyme.	7.036248491001095
Now , hx would be strong enough if these acids should be stronger enough to produce significant concentration of the protonal species , so that it can initiate , react with the monomer.	9.819919753457018
So , that symmetric carbon should have some optical activity.	6.909391502102139
In this method these are the two thermistors which are kept for determining temperature difference as low as 10 to the power minus 4 kelvin.	8.958173222617292
There are two parts in the active site.	5.671710009698104
For variety of situations that range from digestion aid to even treatment of certain deceases which involve the availability of one of the enzyme or removal of some metabolite from the body.	11.488248136450121
So , as you know , the first part is linear up to this point so , this part is elastic and you from this slope , you can get the elastic modulus of the material.	9.143915712220139
Now , as i as i said that , melt from the polymer processing from melt state are mainly three types , we can mainly two types , we can say extrusion and molding.	9.924446544435217
And you can get the reverse also and in that case this point called l c s t is called lower critical solution.	8.980088709809817
Now , if you take maleic anhydride and copolymerize with something which has a negative value of e.	7.341874009677919
Hence , decrease the auto oxidation process.	9.418413729532025
Now , you consider a reaction of a plus bb type or say ab type and consider this is present in one is to one.	8.068611171333169
So , these are limited and the molecular weight , molecular weights are not very high for this proton by this reaction , cationic reaction by this protonation.	9.868037511109874
For example , if i take a tri methyl silyl protected.	6.229356114426253
These are all , all chains are connected , there is no individual molecular weight if the , all at the point when are complete network formation , that is , when the molecular weight becoming 20, and that is a point you can visibly see the gel formation.	11.187353764193244
Again , we define in a similar way; m m is a fraction of these three and r r is fraction of syndiotactic tryad and m r is a fraction of heterotactic tryad.	10.557546879742858
What is the chemical view there.	8.308897388838792
And this rotation or the mobility of the polymer chain depends upon the stiffness of the backbone or the flexibility of the backbone , steric effect , side group , which is basically governed by the side group present and inter molecular forces; the more intermolecular forces , the less is the freedom to move.	10.110880869339743
So , hard means higher elastic modulus where , soft means low elastic modulus and weak can brittle is basically given by the elongational breaks.	10.083702609412597
Based on that he wrote his rate expression and they are almost identical rate expression as michaelis and menten with slight difference which we will notice.	11.611498689126133
Now these interactions tend to distort the substrate and this distortion of the substrate is favored towards reaching the transition state.	8.94706356108448
The diffusional limitations are wiped out straight away or if you take a smaller particle you can get rid of diffusion.	10.568785657271825
So any analytical simple analytical tool can be combined and used.	10.003835760837163
It is basically give you an infinitly molecular so , that happens when p is 1, but if f average is more than 2, then at a lower value you can make a gel point and a gel.	9.908843952394035
If we represent ka and kb as the ionization constant of the two residues that are involved and the third we are taking as km which is the dissociation constant of the enzyme substrate complex.	9.450223845335195
If one can determine the value of s0.9 / s0.1ratio , one can determine the number of binding sites.	8.12176301249571
Now , for anionics , for anionic chain polymerization we need to have monomers , which have electron withdrawing group , electron withdrawing group , which could be , as we discussed earlier , something like this , acrylates or methacrylates , and , and so on , with this can be polymerized anionically because the resulting anion can be stabilized by this resonating with the carbonyl bond.	9.822957622983896
We will talk about this in little detail later.	7.067406424201176
So , n 0 by 2 is the number of functional group present at the beginning.	5.514184399660158
A . b v = k1k2k4.a + k3k4 ( k - 1 + k2 ) . b + k1k3 ( k2 + k4 ) a . b if you try to bring it in the form of generalized rate expression you get k2k4 / ( k2 + k4 ).	8.6997277715094
For those purpose we need certain reagents which are multifunctional and also very , very reactive.	11.372261707969344
So , rest of the propagation and propagation follow the same similar mechanism as we discussed in case of zeigler - natta polymerization.	8.104888562649485
So , poly vinyl alcohols are produced from the hydrolysis of poly vinyl acetates.	10.688585672856298
You can see the related concentration of the shaded portion in the two cases without the catalyst and in the presence of catalyst.	9.313881989597274
And , in more of an , in all practical cases , we can ignore this contribution from n group.	9.218222446880377
Now , because this is very small , very small amount of monomer get consumed in the initiation reaction , we can ignore this; and we can write r p as a sum of all these propagating steps.	9.447331947008749
Actually can form hydrogen bonding between the molecules which actually stabilizes the molecules lower compared to be when it get converted to polymer.	10.694115140867611
Similarly by increasing the agitation speed in the stirred vessel one can reduce or totally reduce the thickness of the film and thereby the gradient on the external film diffusion can be minimized.	9.308531060243553
So , as we know from our previous understanding that cohesive energy is the energy of interaction between the similar molecules.	8.442347069389948
Similarly in case of a living cell if the enzyme system fails many of the processes can be disturbed ultimately leading to the life cycle of the cell itself.	10.76217971443746
Then i plan to cover in details various polymerization processes.	10.695494202455258
The second point is that what are the major advantages or what are the major features and why should we immobilize enzymes.	10.239769002488861
So , this basically gives you the phase you are getting phase diagram of a polymer in a solvent form that original flory - huggins equation , this point you call u c s t upper critical solution temperature , so above this temperature the polymer is soluble in that solvent at any composition.	8.457749731481284
Now if i consider phi , as the intensity of the , or flask of the incoming light , and.	9.250247118022251
Now , let give , let us give few examples where we talk about carbon 13 nmr , can be used to quantify and identify the polymers.	9.564592327359842
It is both for non - athermal mixing; del h mixing is not equals to 0 and also contribution from other than combinatorial entropy.	8.72730829753296
That means in such a case the hydrogen ion acts as a competitive inhibitor for the substrate.	6.982325324485356
Now , we calculated the entropy or the enthalpy of mixing as k t , this is mentioned here and you can replace like this also.	10.516166965324908
As we also mentioned right in the beginning , that any kinetic analysis will involve the match between the hypothesis , the rate expression and the experimental data.	8.443986541115569
The enzyme gets grafted on to the matrix and some other molecule is released.	10.533262343344454
So , basically these homopolymer data rate for this.	5.992799393044082
You can get a thermodynamic picture of the enzyme substrate binding and also you will notice that the interaction on the x - axis will give you.	9.469073322808564
Now , the reaction is fast , so the when the monomer defuse to the interface immediately it find a chain end reactive chain end and in reacts before even can approach to the other monomer , which means that this unlike this linear poly condensation reaction , which talked about it happens in a kinetic control way and it is very fast.	9.959708791856373
When we go on to consider along with the reaction kinetics we consider mass transfer and all more complications we will tend to approximate our reactor performance in either zero order or first order regime rather than making it a michaelis menten equation which might make the solution of the expressions more difficult or it can be done by any numerical methods.	9.906672140639564
That means the concentration of any particular species in the reaction system is uniform through out the content of the reactor and this concentration is same as that in the outlet stream.	9.38328004817768
This carbon atom is a planar molecule and then when you , when the next monomer approach , it can approach from either side.	11.086100248739628
So the only difference lies in the case of reactor performance of plug flow reactor.	7.993109761390732
The thermister is mounted at the extreme end of the fluid.	12.312165848899216
We will go into little more details on the chemical nature of enzymes that means enzymes or proteins.	8.139204551297345
Ultimately for the reaction to take place they have to pass through a transition state.	8.152033414449795
If you go a little deeper into the various activities of a living cell besides looking at the industrial application , a living cell is a very complex entity.	11.154444037108254
The second issue which is important in the case of ph effects is the stability of the protein confirmation.	8.325066257536522
The other examples or other types , where you can utilize is , a photo chemical initiator , photo chemical initiator or photo initiator , in short.	10.436085530277674
And again it is a , as we can remember the discussion for radical polymerization , we can write if there is bimolecular reaction between a monomer and a carbanionic chain end.	11.764464018322727
So , that there is no error in the concentration values , because this is very important to know the concentration values and we need to get the accurate value d n by d c , and if this more important because the final expression have given by d c square term.	9.737610952169168
So , detection becomes very difficult.	6.64829663276422
Unless applications emerge one will not like to produce them in large quantities.	10.96557851756053
That means adsorption increases with temperature.	6.801417249379402
So , we can classify as a synthetic polymers.	5.698418594330573
So what we do is in this case therefore for each set of data point between s and v we develop a straight line.	10.209576669648385
Now for example , let us take a metallocene polymerization.	9.254279782552377
The larger this concentration of the transition state complex , the higher will be the rate of reaction and this rate will depend upon the frequency at which the activated complex will decompose and this rate of decomposition will depend upon the vibrational frequency of the bond that is breaking.	11.3978249718887
This enzyme substrate complex can break down to the active enzyme plus product with k1, k - 1 and k.	10.040966565721263
If you have excess , this diamine has an excess quantity , then we will land up in a polymeric or oligomeric chain , where both sides are capped with amine group.	8.985973551420196
Now if you look at the whole picture of the enzymatic catalyses again , in the energy diagram we notice the bold lines which go here from the ground state e + a + b uncatalyzed reaction that is the non enzymatic reaction is this one.	9.776849495157432
You have a stern vessel in which at the bottom there is a membrane with a narrow molecular weight cut off.	10.194911310416172
Km e + s es e + p + + i i ki aki akm ei + s esi in most cases it so happens that the inhibition constant for binding of inhibitor to the free enzyme or binding of inhibitor to the enzyme substrate complex are not identical as assumed in the non - competitive inhibition and therefore the presence of inhibitor on the enzyme changes km also by the same factor a km and in such cases the rate expression becomes modified.	9.042723802786833
So we will discuss this process in coming pages.	9.10405684736137
Because use of packed bed reactors with an almost 40 % total solids syrup is highly energy intensive and is usually avoided.	10.701124936033123
Anti microbials , which protect polymer from microbes , bacterias , and so on; metal deactivators , which basically deactivate the catalyst residues or metallic impurities residues , which basically help in , or which basically degrades the polymer , during its use or in processing time.	11.603076298622222
That depends on the requirement for the enzyme.	9.954178389253267
Now let us consider the simplest of the dienes which are 1, 3 butadiene.	8.664024188929613
So , the radius of gyration gives more , or gives the solution , the solution behavior of polymer coil is mostly dependent on the radius of gyration , where the rubber elasticity is covered by the root mean square end to end distance.	7.52265330749799
T = q of all the data must be equal to the actual quantity of tracer which has been put in.	9.299236068272931
And obviously , it can do chemical attack , and bring down the molecular weight.	8.648081239138467
That means this is all this examples we are talking about favoring mixing so as i mentioned , if psi is positive then for mixing to happen temperature has to be higher than theta.	10.907451064542942
Now alternatively we can use the inherent viscosity which can be expressed and specific viscosity is much lower than .	12.40376053686508
So , in that case intrinsic viscosity will be smaller.	6.586407759117257
That is one simple example but at many points where the substrate has more than one routes to follow in the biochemical metabolics its preference or the likely physiological route can be decided on the basis of km value and that has been possible based on the understanding of michaelis menten kinetics.	9.545729172015436
A carboxymethyl which is nad analogue is activated using carbodiimide under acidic conditions to give you an activated nad.	10.770185109397485
So , if there are two hydrodynamic chains having same hydrodynamic volume irrespective of the chemical and structural difference , the product of intrinsic viscosity and the molecule would be the same.	8.061425167193999
This has been experimentally proven fact , that the reactivity of the equal , the functional groups are equal when in molecular species s present in a step polymers state.	10.024220391406594
That means to stretch it little bit , you have to apply very high stress.	9.070281013966634
That means , typically these hang around between this and if you do not remove your condensate or the polymer , if you wish , then your reaction will end up at oligomer stage , may be dimer , trimer or tetramer.	11.054272488991073
So , we can write the eta s p is linearly related to c concentration only till eta r is less than .	6.558536564174286
Now , we just gave example of this alpha 6 amino caproic acids condensing to 6 amino caproic acid poly caproic acid in last page , this one.	8.64016391141859
I think you may like to go through and i suggest some of the references; you just go through them; you will find the experimental details as to how they arrived at the final decisions.	11.021598725962427
In both the cases the cis product is dominating.	9.570949092825686
Now , before i come to the introduction of polymers or polymer chemistry , i just want to give you a big picture , a view on the top , a bird s eye view from how you look at polymers.	9.396489483482002
Let us consider in the second step all these dimers reacted with each other forming tetramer.	10.415785268763647
Whereas , instead of c h 2 c h 2, if you have alpine group , which makes the chain even stiffer , then your t m goes up drastically.	10.090566136204774
So , the t g goes up.	3.7022597157577497
The first issue as to why we study enzymes opens up many features of enzyme molecules and the first and probably the most important is their role in a living cell or their role in the realm of biotechnology as a whole.	9.422843804119553
Now , what happens when there is more than one chain , real scenario if you are talking about polymer solution or a polymer melt or a polymer mass obviously , there is no single chain they are many chains.	9.92739412880452
And then go into the mechanism and kinetics of radical polymerization , which will include the dependence of polymerization rate on initial , initiator concentration as well as monomer concentration.	9.346268968157009
Now , again in case of radical polymerization , it is little complicated because the molecular weight forms during defined times of polymers are different.	10.46817224894646
One difference is that the difference in the activity of these different ion - pairs is much , much strong in case of anionic polymers , anionic chain reactions , which means , that reactivity of free ion , the difference in reactivity of free ion - pair , which is a tight ion - pair , is much more important in case of ionic chain polymer , anionic chain polymerization than in case of cationic chain polymerization.	10.189634316860298
You place the wax and these are called thermoplastics.	11.940030574364316
That means if there is a particular state of ionization of the active site of the amino acid involved , whatever fraction of the enzymes present in that fraction will constitute the catalytically functional enzyme.	9.280072772417457
So if we require a definite property , or a property if you are looking for , for particular application then if that property is not available in a single homopolymer , then you can , from a prior knowledge of the properties of the homopolymers , you can actually synthesis copolymer of required proportion to get that property you want.	10.53241779863506
Such a system practically is not very , very attractive because as i mentioned they tend to inactivate the enzyme because water miscible solvents often tend to extract the bound water layer of the enzyme and thereby the confirmation is disturbed.	11.970639844132112
Now , let us begin or continue our discussion on molecular weight , molecular weight of the polymer produced in radical chain polymerization.	5.551367305595284
So the labor and the enzyme cost are the major factors.	10.52325215096367
Here i like to draw your attention about active site.	8.94874498117317
So , in this case because it is a kinetically controlled fast reaction reactivity of the reacting monomers would determine , whether its form a random copolymer or a or a block a copolymer.	8.317923783779785
If the counter ion for anionic or cationic case they are free , then what happens.	8.482783752722064
If suppose you take a polycationic carrier , the shift will be on the acidic side.	9.590057859022572
So , the reactivity goes up and if we talk about the effect of counter ion , so let us consider first the polar solvent.	8.624147005559356
That means at a time equal to zero.	6.401803198355449
When we discuss the reaction mechanism we will see that they are very efficient catalyst and when i say very efficient catalyst our counter part to compare is the chemical catalyst.	10.124816624734443
It should not be accepted for determining the flow behavior and once you checked that the total quantity of tracer which has been put in matches with the tracer quantity which has come out in the output stream , which is sc.	9.731875720828059
The presence of even trace of oxygen inhibits polymerization reaction.	9.271322866327404
So , they are used in the inert use of the tyres engineer , autobody mounts and electrical cable insulator , protective gloves , etcetera and some form of stoppers.	9.230357011484225
Also the sign of slope i have shown only the positive slope it could end up in a negative slope also.	10.138356250715116
So , they form this arylic , allyl chloride to non allylic sites and prevent degradation.	8.335704725159651
It is available in this form as well in this form.	8.237831878243075
So , basically there is no destructive interference at theta is equal to .	7.525250253337206
In practice in many of the enzymes for practical applications , you might end up with a profile like this which consists of not ionization of one or two amino acid residues but more than two , may be five , may be seven and may be six.	10.07900851939562
So , you need to know the concentration of each monomers very well.	6.86490928367608
It is of as you can see the structure that it is having the bulky side group.	8.4270087102033
And if it is syndiotactic , then r and r r also will be .	9.902149032813776
Whereas 6 member ring is not that feasible to or basically it is not feasible to polymerize thermodynamically.	12.70906834707847
So , now we have plotted all this data we know this intercept and we can get the slopes for c is equal to 0 line , and for this theta is equal to 0 line.	8.03750781978165
So , we will find that the delays values are more or less independent or every monomer in this chain polymerization.	7.566281873279188
If i want to just show you pictorially or schematically this is the representation of polymers , you have this structure units monomers and on polymerization its gives you a linkage between the polymers making a large molecules.	10.952520658802136
In this lecture we are going to cover , general features of chain polymerization , which we will basically revisit from our introduction lecture.	8.59404884733533
You know different stages , life stages of polymers and how it get transformed where they induce of polymers.	8.110949488679461
Now , block copolymers also could be different types , like linear , the type we just showed.	10.391838040217454
In those cases another factor which we make use often for analyzing the reaction mechanism is the enzyme inhibition data.	10.027279549847519
If you want to do a reaction at low temperature for whatever reason , then this is the initiator system , you can apply and as these things are soluble in acquits medium , you can carry out the acquits radical polymerization using , redox initiator like this , or even if you want to do a , your radical polymerization in emulsions , then also this type of reactions can be initiator can be used.	9.792170319208331
Similarly in the case with colloidal platinum or vanadium pentoxide or even acids acts as a catalyst.	8.918775041930655
As we will see what is the quantification or how much excess we have to take to target a sudden molecular weight.	9.705376235037322
Now , p e m 0 has reacted.	8.832990752086602
That means the product formation will take place from the substrate complex.	6.57434362758069
Now in the expression of r 1 and r 2, we do not have any rate constant for the termination and initiation reactions , which means that if we talk about that expression.	7.805575428446001
Obviously resulting polymers which have similar strain.	11.598929132132156
You will notice that only at extreme values of hydrogen ion concentration there will be difference in the behavior of the enzyme.	9.623884645466077
Welcome to this 12th lecture of course in polymer chemistry.	6.8070272006159644
For example if i look at the t half values for the some commonly used initiator.	8.139271523207881
They are tg weather 105 degree centigrade.	7.223775419343293
If you remember , say , acrylonitrile or methyl methacrylate where this anion charge get delocalized by resonance with the substitute group and this requirement of resonance with the substituted group again makes this as planar.	9.997984083372893
So , if the , if the say this is like a coiled structure , if the stiffness goes up , it may be like something like a worm like , because it is not so flexible to become a coil; and if the chain becomes , even more steep then finally , it will be like a rod.	10.483144474364437
You must have a method for the detection of the product formed of the reaction.	8.190809369367553
Now , we can , before we talk about the value of e r we can similarly write from the expression of x n.	9.42630195897441
Now , what is a molecular weight distribution.	6.680138689826366
So , this reaction is done about the melting temperature , its continuous process and while talking about the chain transfer to the polymers , we gave examples of polyethylene because indeed chain transfer reaction happens to polymers in this case.	9.029498498038686
Then the reactor capacity; although under given set of conditions you may get certain kind of productivity for a reactor capacity will be given by the vm.	8.998826926399905
It can be easily we can rotate this around this single bond and if we can rotate we can get.	10.28734166338423
The melt processing becomes easier and in this case because we talked about application of this polymers in playing.	12.418224007731933
So , between two of this molecules exchange ester exchange happen and as you take out this ethylene glycol from the system polymerization medium the polymer start growing slowly this is the.	10.833512311632676
Linked means , what i mean that basically , the polymers are exposed or be in contact with heat or some environment conditions and then , the properties mechanical properties of polymers are followed according after exposure.	12.322455281645624
So , basically the reactivity of different monomers towards a particular particle towards a particular radical will depend on the stability of the resulting radical from that monomer.	9.256813912600558
The porosity of the carrier depends on the surface area which will also result from the porosity as well as the particle size.	11.215548253927627
On the other hand in case the mass transfer effects are very severe they can be totally rate limiting steps.	8.571896714324055
It reaches equilibrium at a very short time and then the reaction proceeds further to form the product.	9.420906991148895
It is only es complex which will lead to product formation.	6.853718602667949
If the solvent becomes good , then the term a 3 in the expression; if the solvent becomes sufficiently good then this term may become significant which means c square terms may also contribute and if a 3 becomes significant then c square terms contribute.	10.488732624632824
Once you made this polymer of course we want to know that what we have made both in chemical term; that means what is the constitution.	11.914427493616662
Consider an enzyme catalyzed system and an uncatalyzed system.	10.176416401607872
If r c h 3 which is methyl methacrylate and t g is around 105; if we ethyl is 65; n - propyl 38; n - butyl minus 2; n - octyl minus 42; n - lauryl minus 62 degree centigrade.	9.782333843282077
In last lecture , we were discussing about polymer properties and their evolution.	8.494452939529895
If you want to compare the reactivity of these different monomers , m 1, m 2, m 3 towards a particular radical , essentially dictate by the stability of these 3 propagating radicals.	8.33583594245863
Now , let us consider or let us compare few monomers and their del s.	6.943537708346472
Now , i compare between acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate , now acrylonitrile is a electron accepting monomer , where this is electron.	9.242897989359355
Now , the two types of polymer chains can be imagine , one is free draining polymer chains , where the solvent molecules , when you when polymer chains moves in a solvent in a solution , polymer chains moves in a solution; if the polymer chains moves without the solvent molecules , which are the associated with this , and the solvent molecules move past the polymer molecules.	10.6474721291584
Sometimes , they are unwillingly or unwantedly some reaction also take place inside extruder.	12.433137502835322
This is audiotape cassettes , office fixtures , tumbles and in medical because this styrene has an aromatic backbone.	9.518103131689974
But in case of ring opening you get slow increase in the molecular weight with the or the linear increase over the molecular weight with the conversion of monomer.	9.86761871280386
Either of that can be written.	15.223612508052987
When l is small that means it is a very thin film or very small diameter particles , the value of kappm will approach to that of km and there will be no diffusion control and under ideal condition l is equal to zero for soluble enzyme.	10.149945873109854
See , if for a this small ratio; so if i found after the polymerization is made from our carbon that the ratio for these three carbonated is for fifty - fifty feed ratio , monomer ratio , then we will know that it is a random copolymer.	9.378563576883186
In terms of size , we discussed a contour length , which is basically n multiplied by n is the number of bonds , and l is the length of each bonds.	9.492019732754407
These are the examples of inorganic polymers.	6.337701281883847
If your medium contains phosphate ions , calcium alginate will slowly get dislodged and you will end up in dissolution of immobilized preparation and sometimes instead of calcium , barium or aluminium is used as a counter ion.	9.461303416564368
I am writing this equilibrium reaction for.	9.101629331166624
For example if you have a , it is the substitution of phenyl group , styrene , in case of styrene then it can be polymerized by all three , and if you have a another double bond hanging from the , the original double bond then also it can be stabilized , by any of these three mechanisms anionic , cationic , and radicals , which can be polymerized by all three mechanism.	9.339731765853335
But alternatively solution using michaelis menten kinetics also can be obtained numerically.	13.59607692340701
So , logic , all the arguments remains similar as in the case of atip.	10.079241268475808
After these secondary structures are formed again the molecule as the result of vander waal forces and electrostatic interactions force into a compact globular molecule.	9.966512452340279
The polymeric network can be obtained from monomers , oligomers or polymeric precursors by changing the solubility variables.	10.914777166097808
And the different type of emission spectra we can use fluorescence , emission from excited electronic single states , phosphorescence , emissions from excited electronic triplet states.	10.225729566562055
So , how to get the value for m v.	7.728252997434239
So , we are writing k r and k m for the measure which will give the isotactic addition; this is syndiotactic addition.	8.33772906609248
We will discuss q - e scheme and then briefly discuss the ionic copolymerization.	7.884505835551816
The km apparent , if you consider k m as km apparent varies with the hydrogen ion concentration.	10.864197600126234
Again , there are many more; and , there is no buyers for these anti oxidants , from my point.	10.000459915269387
Now , that is very high , it is very difficult to explain.	8.195939812903472
That is coocnhrnhr.	10.618506087680633
Now , if you can reduce this m dot , then what happens is rt comes down much lower.	6.253230460965275
So , basically , one must remember or must consider the cost of the additives used.	7.3837813329503525
It behaves almost like a constant parameter.	10.536253252305999
So , basically what is the test is done , that one polymer samples is specimen is taken , and one load is applied; a definite load , constant load , and then temperature is slowly increased , at a given rate.	10.052388755641157
That means the quantity of the enzyme required will be identical in both cases for carrying out the same conversion and at the same enzyme loading.	8.837888407127819
So , it will try to find space to go , now it can go inside micelle or it can go the monomer droplets , because that is the place where you have hydrophobic environment.	10.266504519342359
Particle size was chosen according to that.	10.643531500345137
They analyzed number of reaction mechanisms and using matrix algebra they wrote down rate expression for different kinetic mechanisms and all steady state expressions can be solved out.	10.58798199146836
So , if you can get more sophisticated instrument which can detect the temperature difference even lower than this , then you can increase the upper limit of the molecular weight determination in this technique.	7.973976249933575
Therefore the total mass balance that is qc0 = qc + vdc / dt that means the c will also start coming out here at a flow rate of q.	10.672524966849274
But you have to consider these at an angle other than 0; for example , if i consider this theta then , because these two scattered light have a phase difference they will have a destructive interference between them.	9.342753564030614
Now , we know r i is minus d i by d t.	7.192591754664097
So , that is the one way you can reduce and the volatility of the vocalization of the monomers.	6.751070024400882
You can see that a large number of methods are available.	6.34114490311086
Now , in case of cationic we have seen , that in case of cationic we have seen very fissile beta proton transfer or elimination reaction happening for this transfer reaction , where in case of anionic polymerization you require beta hydride elimination for those transfer reactions with monomer solvent and counterion , all these things to happen.	8.139702337974805
After inserting you can insert any kind of feed stimulus; it can be a step input , it can be a delta input or it can be even a random input , doesn t make a difference.	11.286934281061068
Now , you know that the product of a polymerization is a mixture of different chain links.	9.703115480497354
Another product is formed.	7.966052555298869
There is a possibility that the initiator molecules can aggregate.	9.03539317276892
Now , if i want to compare the reactivity of the radicals , see if i want to compare reactivity of different radicals with a single monomer , then what it will give.	7.971318849402062
So , again stating it for getting high molecular polymer , you made a conversion p greater than 0.98 and so; 0.98 give you 50 and so , as increase will be p , the higher and higher value of x n.	9.288329176755111
Weatherability is basically combination all this effects; like rain , air , heat , light , so combine all this we call of.	11.323776381402647
The second motivating factor was many people also wanted to study the enzymes in their natural habitat or at least as close to the natural habitat.	10.449303211432165
The second class of the kinetic parameters is defined as inherent parameter.	9.205812263486994
Let us , go one by one i expect that a student after going through this module should understand the mechanistic differences between step and chain copolymers , chain polymerization should which polymerization , so it should be polymerization.	9.43479540215924
As a matter of fact the conventional method other than this for maleic acid is only isolation from fruits which has to be very , very expensive compared to this method but fumaric acid is available as synthetic organic acid and fumaric acid can be converted to maleic acids for variety of applications.	9.147308933483442
And hence , the polymer mobility goes up and t g also goes down.	9.174493776299405
Almost the same assumptions that we made in case of michaelis menten kinetics and the a and b can be to a saturating level providing a maximum reaction velocity.	10.13973246998062
One is linear where q is the concentration of the enzyme protein on to the surface of the carrier; y is the corresponding concentration in the solution at equilibrium.	9.520102441137498
The chain transfer position for the raft reagent we use is very high , so that all raft agents can actually be participating in the chain transfer reaction.	10.07810189435372
So , total probability of finding the chain , other chain end at a distance r would be the probability distribution function multiplied by the volume element.	9.668752886443349
The energy required to reach the transition state is already reduced.	9.828678828537948
That means not a very stable molecule as a covalent compound and therefore when it comes in contact with water it breaks down into the respective acid or alchol.	9.432929041974019
That means the distribution or composition of every species in the reaction mixture whether it is catalyst or a substrate or a product is uniform throughout the reaction mixture.	9.161367036134248
The other method is cross linking.	7.2507666436711915
At least two substrate reactions and if not any other directly converting substrate water is a molecule which participates in the reaction.	8.760017779113847
The gel will not allow the enzyme to pass through but the small molecular weight substrate and product can easily be allowed to get in or come out.	9.905654957379548
Now , it can abstract this hydrogen and form these dead chain , and you have a new polymer , where you have a radical generated in between not the end.	8.982599244924144
Substrate binding to the enzyme site on the active site may also play an important role in providing the substrate molecule in the right orientation.	10.624795386958882
If i talk about the , that same structure , take out that same simple monomer; now , how this can get terminated.	9.909586371501849
Similarly , if you take a semi - crystalline polymer and heat it after the t g , the change in the polymer behavior is less compared to a pure amorphous , because they are part of the polymer material is amorphous; part is crystalline.	10.540304566526068
After the folding is over , two cystein residues can join together to form a sulphydryl and thereby provide a stability to the conformation.	10.210664959916834
This is the concentration in grams per meter cube level which is much lower.	8.190296170071234
So , your molecular weight has no change.	7.552281807304714
So , let us start with thermodynamics of polymer solution and for a solution as we know that the solution can be defined as a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances; homogeneous means that the mixture is at molecular level.	8.59196685168052
It can be in the form of a current; it can be in the form of potential difference; it can be the form of temperature change and variety of signals can be generated and that depends on the type of producing.	10.427408653436006
When you look at a three dimensional space , in a three dimensional space the one and three will not be in the same plane.	11.69114389892741
Once you make the polymer , we have we basically understood what the different polymerization mechanism like step growth mechanism , chain growth mechanism and define specific technique polymerization technique.	11.056477058504743
There will not be much pressure drop because just like in the case of a packed bed reactor the particles are all compact.	8.086715108226334
We all talked about that.	9.798802653103097
So , you if you draw t g with mole fraction you are going to get like this , so this your glassy part.	9.219806393498594
Therefore whenever we look at any experimental data you must ensure that under certain set of conditions the assumptions that are built in , in the michaelis menten kinetics are true and they are met.	11.029352533550583
Of the two of the most sort after parameters , one is temperature.	11.13993327950121
Now , there could be another type of reactions , by which propagating radical or a kinetic chain can get terminated , which is transfer reactions.	8.885727066767618
And this is the point where , polymer breaks , polymer fails , the basically failed apart and this is the corresponding stress is called the ultimate stress and the strain is the ultimate strain , which is the strain or elongation at at break.	10.604701553631969
Now , there are other step there are several other step polymers , which you know because of time or this course of this polymers is not to go through the detailed synthesis procedure of this polymers.	9.475543079268956
I mentioned that the molecule will consist of a number of ionisable amino acid residues and these ionisable amino acid residues might have molecules at a distance having positive and negative charges and when they interact they might exhibit the an electro static interactions and provide stability to the molecule.	10.322150002407513
Is density , g is the superficial mass velocity and is the viscosity; row is again density and d is the diffusivity.	11.137648275578716
So , it becomes you know lot of cases.	7.890033536285434
Because , this is a total number of monomers polymerized and this is the number of chains formed so that will give the number of average number of monomers present in a single chain.	10.012251035574415
So , in x mar , we have x minus 1 a group which is reactant.	8.294043403025308
If the t becomes large now the required size of the t will depend upon the magnitude of ( k1s + k - 1 + k2 ).	8.139810410736116
To avoid this remember , we talked about again that v h polymer size is proportional to intrinsic viscosity multiplied by molecular weight.	8.955353266872779
The approximation or propinquity effect will lead to benefit in the reaction rate , one by a reduction of energy of activation as a result of entropic contribution and the other is as a result of apparent higher concentration at the active site.	9.250909215781434
All these factors will depend on the design of the active site which the nature has evolved in the evolutionary process.	9.083407618890075
One can determine experimentally , the various kinetic parameters in the case of a bi - substrate reaction.	7.730388620819131
And then which can react with another ring cyclic molecules and let the chin propagate.	10.532500318274364
But , at least we can estimate , we can find out the direction that , if we do certain changes of a certain polymer structure of what the expected change in the glass transition should be.	10.351681797995399
Now , it can actually form a cycle and it can knock out this methoxy and terminate this chain.	7.908948698313783
Entanglements will occur for polymer chains above a critical molecular weight , and we call that molecular weight as entanglement molecular weight m e.	12.156357609051778
Now , we know propagation , and this can undergo termination; third step , we will talk to that in a minute.	8.612677364227634
If the ions are important for enzyme activity then they must be provided in the electrolyte itself.	8.749221150371083
They cannot be used conventionally in organic solvent.	9.194157987915995
And if it is very stiff obviously , it will break immediately or it will break easily , as you can example glass , because glass is very stiff it breaks as soon as you hit it , whereas if you have rubber or a soft polymer , if you hit it , it would not break , it absorbs the energy because the glass chains are much stiffer compared to a rubber chains , where the rubber consists of flexible polymer chains , so they absorb the energy.	10.840388536084594
At this temperature , they will start precipitating.	11.87555053751417
In addition to that their effect on the ionization behavior and ultimately the rate effect and putting both the things together can give you a confirmatory result or conclusion on the identification of the amino acid residues on the reaction rate.	7.951914569753594
It was only a conceptual explanation given because at that time , one thing we must appreciate that , not a very large number of enzyme reactions were understood.	9.831318591007697
Enzyme loading high means the catalytic rate will be very high because the enzyme activity in terms of international units , the reaction rate per unit weight of the carrier , if that is very high compared to the rate of diffusion then the whole system can be conceived to be totally diffusion limited.	11.831954997278414
That means again they assumed the same thing e + s x e + p they also expanded the whole hypothesis.	9.608427266295182
The fraction of conversion keeping the residence time constant and over operational time , this is operational time not the residence time , residence time is constant here it will go down.	10.153714389351261
Let us take a example of polycarbonate , we know we have seen during our first few lectures , this is the way we make polycarbonate , this final a is reacted with a carbonate source , so this is the structure of polycarbonate.	9.578015256404026
So , if z is the coordination number which is the number of cells present in the first level , you can add in any of these cells.	9.921326313160126
So , during processing , the hydroxylation , the hydrolysis is less , so the molecular drop.	9.454012722416973
Again , b b , this will react with a a and b b and so on.	8.223084801387879
That means magnitude by which the dissociation constant of binding of inhibitor is modified can be determined.	9.329368962577503
Now , that temperature corresponds to an equilibrium value of the free monomer determined by the values of del h 0 and del s .	9.343926111426661
If the reaction has to take place , then they must start colliding with each other.	7.267983586368259
These are called oligomers and and a small amount of monomer depending upon at which stage you have stopped the reaction.	7.716119635276548
Remember , that if , if you take a very non - polar medium or hydrocarbon medium , then this initiator molecules can actually aggregate effectively reducing the concentration of the available initiator , which means this you have to compensate or you have to take care of that correction in the concentration of initiator term to actually get the rate of polymerization.	10.795221983017456
Now , if i look at that transfer reaction one more time , so if i take a mu , so yb inter x a am writing yb and now it is producing m n y plus b dot , k z is the red constant for reaction.	9.120851978687934
Glucose plus oxygen will give you gluconic acid and in the sample when you bring the glucose sample in proximity of the electrode which has the glucose oxidase as enzyme deposited on it the enzyme will react with the glucose in the presence of oxygen and consume oxygen.	11.859329151136535
And if the polymers in barriers applications like , packaging industries , the demand going day by day , for preserving flavor , safety of food products.	9.493594378325493
Now , the most stable radical is , it will participate in the transfer reaction in more extent , the lower is the if it is lower , then it will participate in the transfer reaction in lower extent.	9.48090457618319
A very typical example and probably the most easily understood example is of oxidation of succinic acid to fumaric acid.	9.43158356746963
So , the original definition of addition and condensation polymers where addition was polymers which are made from addition reaction.	6.275529308895336
And at related temperature this term the contribution of excess chemical potential becomes 0 and the solutions become ideally.	10.792361497918174
They do not interact with the essential water layer on the enzyme molecule because of their non - polar nature and therefore the enzyme structure is maintained.	11.633622823132836
Although this provides a very neat system for carrying out enzymatic reaction in organic phase , the only problem is the recovery of the product , after the reaction is over , from the system.	9.841918505050765
And , also , with our knowledge , that all the radicals which are generated by the homiletic cleavage of the initiator molecule , they do not react or they do not initiate the chain polymerization; the fraction of the radicals which generated here , some of them actually initiate the radical polymerization; and so , we multiplied term f , which is here the efficiency.	10.775807303589053
So , you test the mechanical properties , the different types of test can be conducted , static states test like a tensile compressive shear properties , which gives stress and curves , stiffness and strength and toughness of polymeric material.	9.00201683257046
That means if it is a growing cell then part of the cell will attach and some of the cells will be leaking out also.	10.160602031406848
I think this is n ncl.	11.28038260500702
Because the active site is not exactly complementary , after the substrate approaches the binding sites it forces the reacting group to develop a strain so as to bring in complementary to the catalytic sites.	10.05194370960368
As you increase p , molecular weight goes up which is expected and for a given p for any of this , if you consider any of this curve.	11.45946381065438
Another interesting reaction in the living systems is on oxidation of methane.	12.449840437440669
And the rubbery state is basically having a long - range rotational motion of polymer segments and it is a soft and flexible.	10.586499669566207
So , k c , the intercept; c is equal to 0 and theta is equal to 0 should give you one ever weight average molecular.	8.075994631468598
Now , iupac because there is so many confusion or about naming polymers iupac has given a guideline how to name polymers.	9.033369487414154
So basically if we can get the delta e , now we can apply the same similar experimental procedure; like osmotic pressure measurement we can make five different or few different dilute solutions of different concentration and measure the delta t e and then plot delta t e by c with concentration to get k e by m n and a .	10.178146272212695
If you know that this is a alternate copolymers , between any two monomers; a poly a and poly b , then we can write it is a a l t alternate , as a alternate copolymer , and if you know it is a block polymer , if you want to write block polymer , then we can write poly a block poly b or poly a block poly b , both way we can write in this case , but only write different types of copolymers like statistical random on alternate copolymer , you should follow these type of nomenclature , we just mention.	10.910904585869824
So here we are violating some of the basic assumptions of the michaelis menten equation.	10.17619824483771
The scattering angle decreases much with a p theta; the scattering factor decreases much with the scattering angle when you have a large molecule where dimension is larger.	10.79641367634876
And while talking these general characteristics of ionic polymerization we will compare its differences or its likeliness with the chain , radical chain polymerization.	8.969152028339767
So if you change any of these three polymer solvent and temperature , then k and a value will be changed.	9.124227964398198
Because the enzyme is entrapped it does not have any interactions or modifications or involvement or coupling of the amino acid residues of the protein molecules with that of the matrix of the immobilize enzyme preparation and therefore the sole force that keeps the enzyme molecules bound to the matrix is the porous network and purely by molecular size.	10.58145514345915
How to approach the situation incase if the flow behavior is not ideal interms of perfectly well back mix or a plug flow behavior.	9.070240046798576
So , most often we write , m n is this.	7.962257662135746
You can actually afford to have some degree of this impurities in cases of radical chain polymerization and that is why this radical chain polymerization are utilized in industry , the large set up , much more frequently than ionic chain polymerization.	8.862929216928046
The diffusion will entirely depend on the preparation.	9.373167559833284
And , we must remember , if you are talking about the stabilizations specifically , you must remember the mechanism by which the polymers are degraded , when subject to heat , light , shear , moisture , either during the processing or during the manufacturer , and during its life cycle.	9.026368398102989
So , we are writing r p as the rate of reaction , which is same as rate of propagation , whereas k p is the rate constant for propagation and e p is the activation energy for propagation.	8.549324028211485
This is based on the appropriate positioning of the catalytic functional groups within the active site of the enzyme.	8.047779504706298
Let us consider this is a propagating chain whether this is an active center; now it could be radical , it could be anionic , or it could be cationic.	10.50364979725093
If you compare a cyclization process and the linear polymerization process , what are the tendencies.	10.12612223843246
So , one , depending on which proton is leaving you can get actually two structures with double bond.	9.143139737447383
Welcome to this lecture fourteen of the course on polymer chemistry.	6.159613972604
Space velocity and pressure drop was the key parameters that were studied based on which the whole reactor system was designed and operated continuously.	11.397372677512568
Sometimes what happened in case of non - polar solvent , this aggregation of the initiator molecules , for example , like butane lithium , we just talked about the non - polar medium , butane lithium could be existing in an aggregated form.	9.63444154881266
Kl is the mass transfer coefficient cm / sec.	14.045607266200355
So , as a result , what will happen.	4.616744570510036
So , these monomers , will not undergo a cationic polymerization , it will undergo anionic polymerization , now if you have a radical for example , if your radical initiator , then it will form.	9.508727623485012
So , in case of cationic , r 1 is 10.5 and r 2 is 0..	8.221089200240014
Again , n b is n a by r p n a which gives us n a 1 by r minus p.	8.011613385525864
Now , this is the typical gpc trace where in the y axis you have detector response and in x axis typically you have elution time , and which can easily become what is in to elution volume.	8.954052510080214
So , even if you have a cis chain end it can isomerize and give you a trans product.	9.148266340538536
Because they are not miscible at all , they come out and you have the delamination problem , one layer comes out.	10.787918504889518
Now , this is apparatus of gpc gel permeation chromatography of solvent reservoir which pump the solvent through the columns.	9.688789016082334
Now , what do you except when you make this copolymer will there be alternative copolymer , that mean will you have this ethylene glycol group.	8.687745301251718
Now for isotactic or atactic polymer , both fractions for r will be equals to half.	9.6340944604891
Now , i go to the step growth polymers , and then come back later to compare between these two.	8.609539955934217
And second , where majority of has actually accepted this mechanism which is a monometallic.	11.577638393169792
Similarly we can write , we can know what is the this is the number of carbon atom which gives this number; so 3 carbon atom; nylon .	11.370803779433118
So , this gives the number of possible ways this i plus first chain gets introduced in the lattice when the lattice is already has i number of polymer chains present.	8.476063174925269
Because kl will be equal to kl = jd . g /.	10.290965780038324
Now , you might ask me why and what is the reason this high molecular weight help in giving the , a polymer this superior properties compared to this small molecules.	9.580498361607836
Each molecule has two functional groups at two ends.	11.185375433559964
The substrate concentration drops and ultimately depending upon the extent of conversion which we require , the product concentration increases.	9.531482583604244
The role of protein biosynthesis were their organism which will regulate the synthesis of enzymes.	9.255366916171683
Based volume , performance and price polymers can be also categorized in two class , three classes.	11.081431028877443
So let us go back and look at this slide , we have discussed the back bone stiffness , we have discussed the polarity , we have discussed effect of pendent group size and type.	8.93879956050824
The non - porous carriers will have a low specific surface area because the porous matrix will provide lot of internal surface in a matrix.	10.741199049115492
That means the free energy required for the reactants to reach the level of transition state compound is considered as the energy of activation.	7.102951064443636
Where , they can be semi - crystalline; semi - crystalline , when it has this crystalline regions and which are basically ordered.	11.937556142245755
A part of this binding energy also contributes to specificity and therefore if you look at the effect of strains that are developed , a hypothesis which is called as a strain that means at the stage of binding we understood that in the case of lock and key mechanism they are rigid.	9.470248381199031
And some examples are phosphorous flame retardant , phosphate ester , pvc and these are used mainly for pvc polyurethane polypropylene oxide type polymer.	9.976211901257717
So , there are always chances of having more impurities , compared to if you are doing in a bulk condition or a in a solution pure solution and also it is a batch process it is very difficult to do it continuously and as this reaction is kinetically controlled.	9.494624776529573
You have till the possibility of these molecules participating in the further reaction.	9.362032689410105
It also increases thermal and electrical conductivity , if they are used in proper amount and their dispersion is proper.	10.597438996825414
Then , do from that , you can get the reactivities of the monomer reactivity values of r 1 and r .	8.16953154556966
Now , if you talk about the rate of polymerization , which will help us in designing reaction conditions , which will minimize the cyclic formation , let us look at the rate of ring formation or cyclization and , and the linear polymerization.	10.421864545835058
And if you have disubstitution in single carbon , and unless they are not bulky , it usually works if they are very bulky , then because of the esoteric reasons they did not work and the now , from here if you go , move from more and more substitution , the reaction will become more and more difficult , like this is very difficult , and this two trisubstituted and tetra substituted almost never works in a radical polymerization.	10.95477898606712
And if you have computed system like copolymers blend , we require more than one detector to fully characterize to fully determine molecular weight of those.	11.061058320215748
So , this is the weight fraction between the polymer which eluted and they can be written like this where a is the area under this curve; and if we do interrogation and followed by normalization we can get this weight fraction molecular weight distribution in the form.	9.727448851344716
For example , i have this butyl lithium , which can react with monomers ch 2 this alkyl lithiums are equal to , make this , this curve initiator soluble in organic solvent or soluble in non - polar solvent , as we have seen earlier , how we have discussed earlier , that anionic polymers are typically down at aliphatic hydrocarbons , aromatic hydrocarbons.	9.262943083426444
The other bi - substrate reaction mechanism was a binary complex formation and the case which we talked about was ping pong mechanism which states that at no state ternary complex forms.	10.288011173844161
Very often such a profile is noted in the case of immobilized cells.	8.32083689969344
Their cost is immaterial and you don t make choice on the basis of cost.	10.431028238435761
We will come to that.	4.363165398074348
So , this is a example of co - polycarbonate which is consist of dpa , and the other compound tnb time , we are talking about , now this carbonate peak we call this a and this a , so this particular is from , if this is if the copolymer have two , this final a group making a carbonate linkage , which we can get information from the disfinal polycarbonate homopolymer.	10.041503956620282
So , like radical chain polymerization there are molecules or reagents , which you can or may be undesirably they are present in they can be present in cationic chain polymerization.	8.502756783326872
Chain transfer to polymer is possible and for example , this is the styrene polymerization , cationic polymerization.	11.362301030738205
Es binds to the inhibitor with inhibition constant of a ki to form esi and substrate binds to ei.	11.18792782927885
And , another example of photodegradation of polycarbonate; if you take bpa polycarbonate and keep it outside , for 1 to 1 and a half hours , it turns yellow and becomes hazy and brittle of that time.	9.777270025178437
For therapeutic purposes economics is secondary because primary is the system , the safety of the system.	8.886456035148816
In fact all the sulphur drugs are basically inhibitors of one or the other enzyme operating in the living system.	9.295606219355141
Either way one can determine and that can give you the magnitude of inhibition constant.	11.507178457762407
See , if x mar at a , which one is the end which is free and x minus 1 is the number of a functional group as which is reacted.	10.070125529193694
See , if you can , you going to plot time with molecular width , in this case , for a external catalyst you get a straight line for x n by verses t plot; and in case of self catalyst you get , square verses t as a plot.	10.188694259272808
Then where this , your experience comes , your experience of polymers synthesis terms , what we will do.	8.865500584804678
We can use as we discussed in the case of gpc technique , we can use uv visible detector to find out the molar mass distribution , and we can get spectra , we can detector we can get the gpc , molar mass distribution.	10.871686726386432
Now , what we have seen in last lecture that if you , this spinodal binodal points , for this binodal points , this , you have still first derivative 0, for spinodal points you have second derivative 0, and for the critical point spinodal curve and the binodal curve merges , the third derivative is also 0, and if you just use that formula that gives free energy , this formula and differentiate with phi two , then you will get these expressions.	10.191992784242625
This is from a practical point of view; this is the temperature where its starts softening , the polymer actually starts softening under some load.	10.997501344419263
We will come in the discussion about tacticity in a minute , but for time being , you take my word as that these polymers which have a stereo center to acidic carbons , they can exist as three form; isotactic , syndiotactic and atactic.	9.674119064516203
So , it is not advisable that you do a reaction and stop in between at the level what you target it for.	7.557244706671751
He did not propose any basic hypothesis but suggested based on his experimental observations that with every ten degree centigrade rise in temperature the reaction rate doubles.	11.474165108158948
The soluble enzyme , as we all know , required for immobilization must have certain properties that is it should possess high specific activity and also desirable functional properties that are required for use of immobilization enzyme.	10.536033767524637
We are comparing the reactor performance at two different times say from zero time to time t how does the reactor performs.	11.249859648234978
Then the reactivity will come down the reaction rate will be much lower and it will not happen it will not take place in the temperature we are working.	11.168717636939336
Now , to create an inert atmosphere , which typically use nitrogen and argon in the lab , so the nitrogen and argon you are using in the lab to create an inert atmosphere , that has to be extremely dry without moisture and extremely pure and that is a really challenging job for the scientist who actually practice this anionic polymerization.	9.32710373576012
We will talk about cationic and anionic polymerization individually.	8.398092287826925
So finally , delta r s by c at c is equal to 0 will give you the k r s which is this k for the resistance by m n.	8.37020958251452
But if you this in a surface , in fibre or in a film you can also express in terms of a surface area.	9.855648134422703
Fire retardants additives enable plastics to meet various fire safety and performance standards imposed upon them , you know the application of plastics in various common public purpose like say in aeroplane or in building materials.	11.671684893927296
The third and perhaps a very simplistic example is of the hydrolysis of starch for the production of glucose.	9.349525403643092
So , basically number of moles of initiator is basically , will produce same number of moles of polymers at the end of the reaction.	6.431414247074046
So , you know m w bar is close to 2000.	9.735687944934867
Even the binding process will undergo the transition state and for this binding process eab is the product.	10.116582476458369
So , though we name polyethylene because we know that this polymer has been made from ethylene molecule , but because the constitutional repeat unit is this then according to iupac you have to say this as a poly methylene.	10.51304072523138
And in the next lecture we will start our discussion on stereo chemistry of polymerization and subsequently in other lecture , we will talk about coordination polymerization.	7.869177375192269
So , n 2 number of polymer molecules has n 2 into x segments.	7.234404642762366
In the light of specific activity , only your specific activity , again this will also depend on source of the enzyme.	8.013311681771453
So , that you have , you do not have to limit it with number of polymers available , there are so many polymers available now in market.	8.223914697043963
So , for every temperature there is a m e value and if your , at any point of term your reaction concentration , the free , free monomer or the concentration of your free monomer is higher than the equilibrium monomer concentration , reaction will proceed till the reaction , the mono , free monomer concentration is same as the equilibrium monomer concentration.	8.485078654276945
Mainly they have been used extensively for bio medical applications where an additional desirable feature other than the ones we mentioned in the carriers is the prevention of interfacial immunological responses in the bio - medical system.	10.818024580701566
So , in the expression of this m v we just found out that it is having the expression of this.	7.91050420862156
And it happens if the polymer you have synthesized or you have produced is rigid , so that and also there the temperature at which is below their glass transition temperature , so that they are not soft either , so basically they do not stick to each other.	10.141311015951056
While with the increasing temperature on the one side the reaction rate increases , the deactivation constant also increases.	11.17587803713805
And in the in next , next lecture you also consider the little bit of energetic , how the temperature affects the anionic polymerization and how the molecular weight distribution is in case of anionic chain polymerization and how to get the molecular weight from the initial monomer and initiator ratio.	11.245054378512847
This is dx the length of differential element.	10.330119289940953
So , now let us move to other type of initiator , and next let us look for redox initiator.	7.152323882001114
The reaction must be non - spontaneous , should not take place as per the normal thermodynamic concepts.	10.107692579163361
Now let us move to the next topic where we talk about polymer phase separation behavior of polymer solution.	5.832059653586966
Now , obvious this is q is measure of reactivity as we have seen and e is measure of electrostatic charge.	9.744384203695901
So , this is the only polymers or copolymers used , which utilized this cationic chain polymerization commercially.	7.623430616384616
So , if for a polymer , with temperature you can , see all this behavior.	8.847937719869341
So , basically for a given number of monomers polymerized , the number of chains at the end of the polymerization is no more.	7.675440445645146
In fact the preparation of immobilized enzyme by adsorption is very much similar to chromatographic separations on ion exchange resin , although we are only interested in the first part of it.	10.25180170712634
Whereas true strain would be the l at a given time; that is the true strain.	12.643004744618516
So , hydrodynamic volume is higher in this case; hydrodynamic volume is higher in this case.	7.082909918825
This original equipment manufacturer buy this pellets , polycarbonate pellets from any of these big companies and they mold it to , they mold it to give a form of a head lamp cover which they then supply and sell it to a car manufacturer who assemble these head lamp along with other things and have this product in the market.	10.080487288500237
Hydrophobic forces are very often considered to be a major force which is involved in the globular structure.	11.621608390932343
Now , this is mayo equation so any increase in the right hand side , anything which increases the value of right hand side , will decrease the molecular weight.	8.536653362801415
You get same for bulk and say if a solution you get a slower rate because this is straight line , which means that this is a first order reaction.	10.800187441348202
Now , in this , in this expression , this is the expression for rate of propagation and now we know , that the monomer is consumed both , in initiation process and in the propagation process , but because the monomer consumed in the initiation process is very insignificant compared to propagation process , rate of polymerization is equivalent to rate of propagation.	9.58394402087852
Reactant p into p or p square.	13.605689130180256
The es will be given by again three different patterns.	11.156182117526338
They are , the number is very less; it is given 4, 4 to 6 out of 1000 repeat units , 0.2 to 1.6 out of 1000 repeat units.	9.509750558312149
So that is called the strain effect which can take into account both catalytic function as well as specificity.	10.507641091276863
Now , we can get a more general expression of b , if we consider a more general example.	8.260062860700655
Now , if we have a monomer which have a polar group as a , in the substituents like , say you have a methyl chlorate or ethyl group in the backbone , where this is a polar molecule.	10.280107340585182
These are some example shown here.	6.4944655056343175
That means , we know that there are two strategies , we can follow taking one of the bi functional monomer in excess or we can add some amount of chains topper which are nothing but mono functional groups.	10.610257052809699
In most cases the inorganic carriers as i mentioned are the whole range of control pore glass , control pore titanium many of the clays which are naturally occurring like bentonite , animal charcoal and things like that fall under inorganic but the organic carriers are usually polysaccharides , proteins and synthetic polymers.	9.54897187792032
This is only a cross section shown here in the expanded form.	7.8152824575599285
Just to mention these two features that this step growth polymers are reversible equilibrium reaction , and having at a pet k value , which depend on the reactivity and temperature.	10.214574545800913
That means substrate concentration at any given time because not much of product is formed and therefore such an assumption can be held true.	8.788198856053766
So , this all gives number of molecular weight.	5.375594947803402
And , we will talk about polymer blends , little bit briefly; and then , go to the concluding remarks for the course.	8.395981721562404
So , how do you , the polymer are , polymer molecular weights are defined , a simple arithmetic average by total weight divided the number of molecules which gives this , gives us that number average molecular weight.	8.568814659043142
So , for a organic chemist which is doing a stratification reaction for small molecules , a 98 percent conversion may be quite satisfactory which means that at 450 minutes time , he can stop the reaction and take the product which is 98 percent conversion which is quite sufficient and quite satisfactory , but for a polymer chemist , that 90 percent conversion is not sufficient.	9.658654365558977
Crystalline domain exists in room temperature which actually gives this polymer the strength and this is a hard material.	12.892633716335752
It must be in dilute solution , a very dilute solution region and also you need to remember that relative number in this method , you cannot get a measurement for an unknown polymer as such.	10.942186225669182
So , in this case this are the applications which are which are where the minor , there is a minor fraction of polymers going , where polymers are used in a mixture in a solution or some other form whether polymers is either a you know active ingredient or is just act as a support role like enhancing the viscosity enhancer and so on.	8.64231700879637
But , obviously , with this the transparency come down and ductility of the matrices is comes down , with this let us basically come to our discussion on polymer additives.	9.850397261504623
In this case , you are not getting long polymer chain at the beginning.	6.175509615227479
Depending on the number of charged functional groups on the substrate the situation might be more and more complex.	9.463965137917194
Mind the word i am using over a narrow range of temperature increase.	9.595014827152083
There is a mixture of a crystalline region and amorphous regions which do not have any order.	8.484147764528725
So , basically permeability is given by , two factor; the solvability of the gas or vapor in the polymer , and the diffusion co - efficient of the gas in concern , and it is measured , as the permeability is measured , as the rate of transfer of the vapor or the gas per unit area of the material , and per unit measured difference across the flame thickness.	10.26045175129077
It has been de linked from its natural habitat and when we take an enzyme sample in a buffer , its natural structure function may not be identical as it happens in the living cell and that has been recognized very well.	9.656236788239873
So , if you put c is equal to 0 you get this expression and this slope of this line will be given by this is the measure of slope.	8.403186116855016
Typical values of kd for thermal initiator is , 10 to the power minus 4 to 10 to the power minus 9 second inverse , and the usage range , where your kd is formed 10 to the power minus 2, 10 to the power minus 6 centimeter.	8.856490400891182
So , let us keep this intact and m 1, this will lead to m 1 dot m .	8.302642695434312
If suppose we have an enzyme acting on more than one substrate.	9.240070812110513
Although the kinetic parameters of the enzymes does not change in the real sense but there are apparent changes in the kinetic parameters.	10.520470216400202
And it could be the polymerization could be done in an emulsion , now we will talk in more detail about this emulsion polymerization now.	10.330843302514232
Say for example steroids.	12.821937178707604
So , we can write a expression like a chemical , pseudo - chemical energy , where half solvent solvent contact and half segment segment contact give 1 polymer solvent contact and we can also write the interaction energy power contact is the interaction energy for polymer solvent minus half of the interaction energy for the solvent solvent plus interaction energy for the segment segment.	9.444558088504532
Many proteins may be oligomeric proteins that means they may consist of more than one chain and the arrangement of these chains into a particular fashion so that they are able to bring about certain catalytically active sites is called quaternary structure.	9.817813403292073
And sometimes it is deliberately you know wanted it is deliberate somebody , who will deliberately want to include want the branching or cross linking in the polymers.	8.832973616220656
So , we can assign this polymer a from polycarbonate dpa homopolymer , similarly we can make a homopolymer of this particular monomer , there we can know what is the chemical shift for this carbon c 13 peak for this particular carbonate.	9.330926613277128
If you talk about a degree of polymerization 200, say this is probably the number we look for.	8.645502829403252
As you can see from this , r 1 is also less than 1 and r 2 is less than 1, but their re - activities are not very different.	7.641587794551008
If v0 is the rate of uninhibited reaction , classically michaelis menten kinetics , and vi is the rate expression for inhibited reaction , the degree of inhibition that is produced by the presence of inhibitor is obtained even from a theoretical rate expression.	10.417676993051563
Obviously , if you look at these structures , the rotation because of the substitute present , the bulky substituent present as a carbonate term , the rotation becomes more and more with the increase in the size of this substituent.	9.98133464533736
And there the could be deformation in case of semi crystalline polymer could be deformation in in the amorphous region or in case of spur light region.	10.68572021028371
Although they started using immobilized aspartase for producing aspartic acid they discontinued very shortly and shifted to an immobilized cell process where these losses were not there; they immobilized the whole cell itself and the whole activity was retained and the process was more much more economical than an immobilized enzyme process.	9.857119632147587
If the chain stiffness goes up , the size will be up , the viscosity will be up , if there is more interaction between polymer and solvent , the size will be up and the viscosity will be up.	7.951641367126283
The significance of the kinetic studies allows you to understand the reaction mechanism.	8.53805779772305
So when the new monomer adds , there will be a interaction , coordination between the chain end the polymer chain end or active chain end , propagating chain end and the counter ion and the monomer like this.	8.899779597445658
This temperature has mainly three consequences; one is the optimum temperature of the reaction.	8.227359163950105
These two monomers , a and b and then add slight amount of this mono functional group and target a certain molecular weight using this expression , where r is defined as this.	8.878543031141776
What i just missed here is that when you have one sample , second sample can be placed any of this z coordination number but for the third one , one is already blocked; one of the z is blocked.	11.161841250416217
That is why we call this as an azeotropic composition.	7.757758113220121
Instead of polystyrene , if we change it to polycarbonate then k and a value will change.	9.723889202193583
We talked about gel effect and we also talked about the effect of glass - transition temperature on the resulting polymer , effect of glass transition temperature of the resulting polymer on polymerization process.	9.81395590445947
I will illustrate the point with one of the examples.	8.350222190525773
We will see when we go on subsequently how many of the molecules control the rate of reaction by inhibiting or activating a particular enzyme in the beginning of a metabolic pathway.	10.71325865284061
So , it is always comparatively easy to carry out leaving anionic polymerization than leaving cationic polymerization.	7.190514801146696
Means amorphous polymer so in if you want to dissolve a crystalline polymer then you have to also include the contribution for the enthalpy of crystallization.	12.102607488354124
It can never be more than 2 because p cannot be more than .	7.397706251389442
Only difference is the direction of the ph effect will be changed and the analyses will remain on the identical lines.	9.264377187958647
Now say , the sample is undergoing glass transaction temperature , if sample goes glass transaction temperature , which is a endothermic processes , so the system has to supply more energy , so delta will higher , and then once the glass transaction is over , then it will be same , again remain constant , because the heat capacity of the robbery state is higher , typically higher than the glassy state.	10.482636306668743
Number of binding sites , n theoretically should be an integer.	9.979385940456018
Therefore again you can substitute the values and get reaction velocity expression as e0 k1k2 k3 k.	11.952461803900562
So , the same what is explained in a minute.	6.376775074842306
In some cases the change has been favorable.	9.109981390435442
Obviously , b p dominant product among these three and most cases because the 1, 4 addition gives a longer resonance stabilization in most cases , this is the preferred propagation mechanism compared to the other two.	9.996446333891233
Coming to the first case of substrate inhibition , the reaction profile passes through a maximum and at a particular substrate concentration it reaches a maximum value and then it starts dropping.	11.268177472561023
It is a very specific configuration which has been reported and has been used industrially and this system has been used extensively for immobilized enzyme preparations which are in the form of thin films.	9.99549076240054
We must consider immobilized enzymes in the light of a shift from homogenous catalysis to heterogeneous catalysis.	8.866495047212775
Now this is the structure of polyvinyl acetate.	8.529523632159504
So , if there is error here which gets multiplied more in the final value of determined by m w.	7.719019192105513
This analysis to monitor the deviation from the ideality for enzyme reactor in flow pattern is mediated by what we call as residence time distribution.	9.08588618044506
One of the disadvantage is the power requirement for fluidizing the beds because you need to feed the substrate at the very high linear velocities which requires a much higher power consumption and the scale up of the fluidized bed reactors has also been very largely empirical.	10.11243242801905
Now , this the value of this gives you the gibbs free energy mixing i am telling again the value of this gives you the gibbs free energy of mixing for the process of separating a composition corresponding to this to , to composition corresponding to this and this now this value , if you can see any of this points is positive.	8.833470903426866
There is only one reversible step here when the first substrate binds to enzyme rest of the steps are irreversible steps.	8.980095651160344
It is always desirable but that is one of the reasons why we call this kinetic parameters apparent parameters.	9.054694943794102
We applied simple model of terminal model , where we basically we are talking about how the composition of copolymer can be predicted from the reaction , reactivity monomer reactivity ratios.	10.973717949951736
So , what is the total number of functional group here.	5.323949585968382
Del s value is dependent on the concentration of the monomer.	7.948743908215748
So the v immobilized becomes proportional to s . es , if you consider the low substrate concentration and at a small thickness of particles and.	10.572232175851378
The m 1 will get incorporated in the chain at a much faster rate.	8.007508101992276
Transferases involve group transfer reactions where one of the functional group with a substrate molecule is phosphorylated.	13.811155417897195
This is the example of cationic polymerization which has b f 3 threat in propane as minus 60 degree centigrade.	7.836838693285499
So , if you can construct with one of the polymers say polystyrene then the molecular weight of the other polymer can be also determined using this calibration curve; as long as we know the intrinsic viscosity for the polymers we are using and the elution volume from our gpc curve.	9.283015086224847
Now if i write , so this is the propagating chain end.	9.294975806501462
This is equal to v / vm = s / ks = s / ks + s ( 1 + s / ks ) which is same as hyperbolic rate expression.	7.3650585764255325
We will talk about this more when we come back to the mechanical properties of the polymers.	6.373721146713222
And , this is the average number of monomers polymerized per radicals which initiate a polymer chain.	5.628157572471403
This means that the x n , the number wise molecular weight is inversely proportional to the square root of the amount of condensate present.	8.593492047010702
So , you may have one now and immediately after next moment you may have these are apart , or next moment you can have something like this , where we insert like this.	8.824817046750793
For example , if i take a set of monomer like say , let us take an example of styrene and mma , methyl methacrylate radical.	6.402097586176721
In electro static interactions also hydrogen bonding and vander waal interactions forces into a globular mass and the basis of that ultimately leads to minimum energy level because at the minimum energy level it will be stable.	11.345794323183918
What r 1 r 2 is equal to .	12.884028628338879
The entropy of these molecules will consist of translational as well as rotational degrees of freedom.	12.47403748613235
Ss ] 1 / 2 that means the thiele modulus is inversely proportional to the substrate concentration at the surface.	10.143835128394082
So , when you take this polymer at this stage and mix with the other additives and fillers and do a compounding which is a further process which you do in a melt state , as i said in the first lecture , then these functional groups are free to react at there.	9.19014716168341
Now , the key of this reaction , equilibrium reaction if you are around close to one which means that if you do this reaction in a close system without taking out phenol from the system , you land up in an average degrees of polymer of two.	10.011777281195055
Then , it was dramatically the polymerization nature was dramatically changed.	9.1717856083797
However such a enzyme activity can be recovered or this phenomena can be reduced if you can use a proper choice of the method for immobilization.	10.828634425035018
And between this two monomers acrylonitrile have more tendency to undergoing transfer reaction with amine compared to vinyl acetate.	9.414540762265258
So in that case the other alternative is that it should be feasible that other interfering enzyme if there are any it should be possible to inactivate them by some pretreatment which does not influence the desired enzyme.	10.079558893403322
But usually they will be in the ellipsoid kind of the situation where you can determine the conformation by their minor and major axis.	11.609967487203438
Now to make the experiment short , this equilibration between the solvent side and solute side must be fast.	10.365093857323012
Whereas , iupac would suggest that you name this has poly oxide ethylene oxide terephthaloyl.	10.572483497923617
Common technique to study the amino acid residues or identify the amino acid residues at the enzyme active site is by chemical modification of the different function of the groups that are present.	10.306438179068333
Again , it is a straight line.	10.317456098140939
Before we start today's content , let me just take two to three minutes to explain the last slide or last slide page in my previous lecture , last lecture; because i thought that i did , because of time it was completed hurriedly.	10.981902813053669
So ph optimum or the equilibrium constant they are two issues which are to be considered independently.	11.479516675013262
Now in this case from this huggins expression or huggins equation , you only need the value of k h.	9.54529560703207
So , these all are very easy to name in our conventional way as polyethylene terephthalate.	7.475272254892351
L becomes higher than two the value of f is 1 /.	10.73371482118676
So there are three distinct segments one is the biological unit which is integrated with a transducer and the third is anylate.	9.427140958106612
What are the properties we look at when we choose a soluble enzyme.	11.876736490337855
For e you can write the pattern as k - 1, k3b and k.	11.980034283360023
One is to understand the reaction mechanism that a particular reaction follows and second thing is design of reactors.	9.908397061388222
It is possible to carry out the reaction.	5.181016634073533
The second is that the first reaction will have smaller energy of activation.	8.350400797350002
That is the example i gave in the last page that produce isotactic poly methyl methacrylate.	7.4800088398040945
This is your polymer backbone backbone.	7.901472146954298
Kf apparent will be kl . kf . am kappf = kf + kl in your reactor design equation you can incorporate , instead of first order rate constant as this one which is based only on biochemical reaction , this rate expression.	10.131007477425362
So , the polymers must be biocompatible and hemocompatible if it is contact with real blood , anti - thrombogenic because it should not start the coagulation process.	9.872045897158063
And initiator like this , which are medium nucleiophic , they can be utilized to initiate monomers like.	10.869952238360227
The whole concept of immobilization of enzymes started sometime in mid sixties and not before that mainly for two reasons.	9.776313412209905
The one which binds methyl group will be hydrophobic in nature and this will be bound predominantly by electrostatic interactions.	10.725817886088672
You use barley or any other cereal.	13.696540329681733
Now , remember , we , we got this expression for rate of polymerization , this and in case of thermal initiation as well , this , this expression , this expression we got assuming , that the reaction is at steady state.	9.585298057918473
A similar profile is observed in the case of conversion of pyruvate to alanine using same polyacrylamide hydrazide coupled nad and formate dehydrogenase and alanine dehydrogenase.	10.46428887845206
This is x n bar 0 is the degree , number of degrees of polymerization , absence of any chain transfer reaction.	8.821209513765472
If if we have say more than one diol in this case ethylene glycol and say butylene glycol , that case we will have a mixture of two structure unit where you have terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol and also a terephthalic acid and butylene glycol in this , that case we call this or we name this polymers as a copolymers.	11.201115710899346
If you take , if you move one chain , the entire network will come along with it and this is called polymer network or network polymer.	11.426468058644993
E * is energy of activation.	7.826401727294269
So , basically this term gives you the increase in the end - to - end distance , or increase in the dimension , because of the steric restriction both bond angle , and the rotational restriction , which means this is a parameter which predicts or which gives the idea about the stiffness of the chain.	8.888133561270921
They have more or less similar reactivity.	9.933959888685761
Usually both inhibitor and substrate molecules are mutually exclusive and compete with each other.	9.327793961255518
The earlier mechanisms that i mentioned were more or less general in nature.	9.799100358773748
Now if you use this condition and make a polymerization of , say , conjugated diene this counter ion lithium , so let us write here; we will be very close , they are not isolated.	11.651715198235072
So , what do you learn from here that , less then , if there is no scatterer present , or no nothing is present which is or observing light , in the polymer metric then , the transparences dictated , mainly by the value of the reflect index.	10.156273539798423
Bi - substrate reactions can be understood and for the sake of simplicity have been analyzed keeping in view the michaelismenten kinetics.	10.12775728151092
Now , briefly talk about polymer blends , polymer blends is basically mixture of more than one homo polymers or copolymers.	7.981337725485079
That means , the monomers has to be very pure and you know , if required , you can change the ratio r slightly.	10.440044846778205
Now , from the calibration curve we can convert the elution volume to the molecular weight.	7.021648599514429
Why ? basically , in state of radical , this chain polymerization will be initiated by ionic species whether it is an ion cationic or an anionic species.	11.167707042181851
So , these are the factors where the polymer is in dilute solution or concentrate solution , this is a good solvent or poor solvent or theta solvent that will dictate the size and shape of the molecules polymer molecule.	9.080833540330861
That means in the absence of water for hydrolysis which require water as a second substrate or for hydrolysis reaction water is the reactant.	8.857334503454044
You start with polymerization reaction starting with monomer and copolymerize in the presence of enzyme.	8.021979627245914
So , you can write the general you can increase the number of state and you will get a your polymerization.	8.03386690007276
And chi the polymer solvent interaction is be lower than 0.5, they are all inter limited , for theta solvent chi is 0.5 expansion factor is .	10.03677884079748
So , those things has to be kept in mind.	8.90884221760107
What happen to in at the molecular level , in inelastic during elastic registration , the the resistance to deform the resistance to deformation can happen both intermolecular.	10.800050963784894
Each subunit may have an active site for enzyme catalyzed reaction , multiple active sites per enzyme molecule.	9.090989909944646
It was noted to have very serious limitations and the serious limitations are that if you look at any set of data for enzyme catalyzed reaction that means data on the substrate concentration versus reaction velocity you will notice that the experimental data gave very low weightage to the measurements at low substrate concentrations.	10.646902523104565
For example , a molecule is vaporized and then ionized , and then these ions are taken to the detector , and the molecular weight is obtained.	9.196624294434795
An inert dye can be used as a tracer system and by calorimetry it can be estimated or alternatively in the case of enzyme catalyzed reaction any other reactant or any other sugar or any other material , chemical species which will not take part in the reaction can be inserted or which should be possible to analyze at the . . . . . very often some time one ends up in a difficult situation in choosing a good tracer.	10.283582515035317
Then , obviously , the additives will not function after the molded part or the final part is made.	9.7321470482201
Teramid properties in a single polymer , but you can utilized this type of block polymer to comprise to homopolymer and next , and make numerous number of blend composition , but in this chain polymers , we will be discussing the chain co polymer , which where we you had mixing a monomer a , and monomer b , from beginning and making copolymers.	11.424884320066791
You can use this expression to denote to the effect of k , the effect of ionization constant of two amino acid residues on the reaction velocity of the enzyme catalyzed reaction.	7.882268754119743
In the case of un - competitive inhibition , the dissociation constant for the binding of inhibitor to the free enzyme approaches to infinity.	6.718676164960028
The functional groups that are involved in the covalent binding are same as that involved in the preparation of matrix for affinity chromatography.	10.054513569559763
Has increases with the angle of incidence , gloss decreases with the roughness; obviously , the reason that i said that the distance , travel from the surface to the observer , would different from different region , as a result they will phase difference , and intensity will come down.	10.013078629660143
So , once we get the enthalpy of mixing , we have to get the gibbs free energy of mixing and once we get the final expression of the gibbs free energy mixing , then we will look at the usefulness of the flory - huggins theory and what are the limitations or deficiencies in the flory - huggins theory and then , try to apply this flory - huggins theory in the dilute polymer solutions and get the concept of theta temperature.	8.847861622037508
Then if you want that , the perfume to be remains in the bottle for as long as possible.	12.135447307610836
In the absence of hexose , the atp hydrolyzed extremely slowly.	8.131514508778574
Collagen can be taken mixed with the enzyme solution and you make a dispersion of the enzyme with the collagen solution.	11.449978047014897
T g 1 is the t g for the component one , w 1 is the weight fraction.	10.306313268170491
So , now we , this reaction step , reaction can process , you know , undergo in thermodynamic control way or a kinetic control way.	8.891044101787083
Let us consider the rate constants k here ke here.	7.790686102131011
So , what i wanted to do next to just give you idea about step copolymers , now if you have say a amino acid r coh and ns 2 r double dash coh.	8.949140933121415
So , r p would be k p , m , k d , oxidant by reductant concentration by , twice k t to the power half.	6.464040221306345
I am talking of stability with respect to ph and not thermal.	9.739363865476424
Now there could isomerization among the intermediate states.	9.75185177620508
Here if you consider x y and z are the three residues which are the part of the active site which will bind to a , b and c functional group on the substrate.	9.507739819133544
There are no covalent linkages.	9.110662352083065
Therefore in most cases where the enzyme experience steric hindrances , this method can give you a preparation where by the steric hindrances are totally over come.	11.646356993165046
The polymer chain consists of only ccc backbone , whereas in heterogen , in case of heterogen , besides carbon , you might have nitrogen , oxygen and other hetero atoms.	11.36010557977305
Immiscible blinds are block copolymers also have difference in , the refractive index between the , two phases form by the two homopolymers , or two blocks , they will also scatter.	11.502723557287565
Now it can stabilize , and from like this.	8.12630710752858
For this cationic polymerization an inert atmosphere is needed and for that the nitrogen or the argon gas , which are used for creating the inert atmosphere.	10.856025609527448
So giving it will be useless it go to all over the body excepting brain.	13.269140142108494
If you change the fractional conversion to , let us say , 0.99, the erel value shoots up to 2.	11.481683824454834
In the case of soluble enzymes , the enzyme cannot be separated.	7.069686064973952
So , that is the reason that not 100 percent initiator is efficient; and part of it , which , like 30 to 80 percent of radicals generated initially; they actually initiate a polymerization reaction.	7.398699883733541
That means all the binding sites are equal.	6.733250974739837
That means , you must be expecting a high molecular weight you have got a low molecular weight polymers.	8.38692632173818
If the substrate concentration slightly increases the pathway is fully on and the product formation or whatever is corresponding intermediate in pathway are fully available and that advantage provides to the cellular metabolism.	10.241386516243084
Each polymer has x number of segment if we had i number of polymers which is already added.	11.264129861385062
Which means that , this is much faster , this redox reaction is much faster , so generation of radical by redox initiator can be done at much lower temperature , room temperature , or even lower temperature.	9.487901109710846
So , for example if this is a loss of haze , because of haze , lose of contrast , so if you are using two plastic material to view this two , then; obviously , there will loss of contrast.	10.595016788895729
So all the methods are mostly considered in terms of these parameters.	10.4359042734964
That means , the reactivity of a propagating radical towards a monomer does not depend among the length of the polymer chain at the end of which the radical is present.	8.299465560453426
As i mentioned earlier the reactant molecule has to pass through a transition state.	5.629117968492198
Therefore ? = kt / h = rt / nh you are familiar with all these terms.	10.003194658486729
L greater than two kappm is kappm = km.	10.286196646370009
If the common tangent in the slopes will be same and from the slope , we have already seen you can write that mu 1 c equals to mu d.	11.204203727745767
That means the negative logarithm of the dissociation constant of the two charges.	7.666741988916868
What happened.	6.368861559730754
When there is n number of binding sites the only difference is that the definition of vm will change . rest of the rate profile will remain identical and there will be no difference.	9.403851340698148
Even disturbance in one of the enzyme catalysed reactions can lead to some abnormality in the cell function.	12.806633733594756
I mean to say that you have to develop particular hardware reactor , an enzyme reactor in which the whole reactions can be carried out with maximum productivity because ultimately the whole concept or the whole interest between will be on the productivity and which can be tailored by doing the proper process engineering.	10.651022388100033
And these this polyamides are completely formed from aromatic groups containing aromatic groups.	9.351469243459483
For example , if i have different chains in polymers which are connected , covalently connected like this and so on , then this entire polymer is cross linked , so that this individual chain does not exist.	10.065283289518968
So , what we are doing here; this is a constant as i just discussed , this is also constant and we are clubbing these two in another constant and you have the expansion factor and molecular weight to the power half.	9.333172561148231
For example in case we are talking of a very high value product say for example . . . . transformations , a pharmaceutical product where the cost of product or the cost of substrate is very high.	9.189983187256939
It gives you design flexibility , you know there are and also various you know the option of giving you modern styling you know.	10.431901162102069
This is just one example where i want to illustrate in what conditions you have to shift over.	10.669626684989943
And in the inflection point which is e and f , inflection point e and f would be 0, these two points which are inflection points is called spinodal points.	9.037435656762074
Now , polymer segments or polymer bonds cannot be so random because you have restriction of this lengths , each gas molecules can move like this.	8.901710837663202
So it is basically the pendent group which.	9.444063987203425
And in today s lecture , we are going to start our discussion on polymer properties and how they are evaluated , this properties are evaluated.	7.691066426222069
Welcome back , now in this lecture we are going to continue our discussion , we are having in last lecture on chain dimensions.	8.648471204184176
Consider the use of immobilized enzyme in a reactor and pack it in a packed bed , feed in and effluent out.	9.918673991345573
So , you can just use this stirling s approximation and you get this expression.	6.4092758187639856
So , the small alicut is taken from the mixture and applied to maldi plate and it solidifies as the solvent evaporates.	8.914166751721837
The second limitation is that you must follow the linear range of enzyme reaction velocity profile.	10.02665633698095
So , now let us do some maths.	8.301891990468288
Now , once we get r solution , we have the value for r solvent which will give us the value for delta r and if we measure different angles which will give us the value for delta r theta.	9.170075598541889
So , polymerization does not take place in the monomer droplet , actually if you stop the reaction after sometime , you will find that less than 1 percent , actually less than 0.01 percent polymerization polymerization happens in the monomer droplet.	9.843862009863086
For example , if we take a simple monomer; say we take a very simple monomer like this , where y is a substituent.	7.746347863388688
So , you can apply this and you can write s is equal to k n 0 ln n 0 minus n 0; this is n 0 factorial.	9.951173532534341
But when you go from 0.9 to 0.99, the relative quantity of enzyme becomes more than five times and it very significantly increases the relative quantity in the first order regime.	9.05909996444436
S for a given enzyme catalyzed reaction by studying the effect of temperature on the km value of a reaction.	9.842553254114097
So , it will be easier for you to make high molecular even if you cannot remove the small molecular weight byproduct completely or quantity from the reaction medium.	7.6228244452566365
In this case , they could be different.	6.396715876332642
But for theoretical purposes , we assume that the enzyme is distributed uniformly in the reactor whether it is a plug flow reactor or is a batch reactor or a cstr.	9.081113369656647
So , in the first case , in this case which is the normal you know which is , most of the general the chain reaction the initiation is slower compared to the propagation , chain propagation or the formation of polymer chain which means as the chain gets initiated it completes very fast.	10.504476527357436
And hence , the t g goes up.	4.965169552345739
Now , that gives you the value for e r , around 80 to 90 kilo joule per mol inverse.	8.750953297897462
Let us say we define k2 as second order rate constant for the reaction of a and b.	8.20642544500905
Monitor the substrate concentration or fraction of conversion with reference to time and determine the parameters by a single reactor performance data.	12.5740985986079
So , if you want to survive , then your material , the maximum temperature at least should be 45 degree or 50 degree.	7.5628790455715995
The most commonly used method in the laboratories is dynamic batch process in which you mix the two components , the enzyme and the carrier under known conditions or under standard conditions for adsorption , which favours adsorption and agitate them , stir them mechanically , under mild stirring so that the carrier particle should not get degraded and also the enzyme molecules should not be influenced.	10.657340410645448
So now , you have to calculate how many different ways you can arrange this molecules.	7.5616040317545545
So , if you add a polymer sample in a solvent , make a solution , the boiling point elevation for that solvent compared to pure solvent or a freezing point depression compared to pure solvent.	8.515556729584612
We also know the expression of m n and m w m n.	7.229449745097767
When we say higher or less than the km value , when we compare substrate concentration with the km value , what we are looking at in the case of zero order regime , we often look at the km value; km is usually less than 0.01 s.	10.700037976590774
In fact all the tubes at the top are joined in a section so that they come out in the same section.	10.271816910230735
If you want to increase the reaction rate by increasing temperature , we have found out that it does increase the reaction rate in most cases , but in the simultaneous , it also decreases the molecular weight.	9.004596952369187
If you change t c , if you increase t c , the equilibrium constant , concentration of the free monomer increases and so as the other thing , m e increases , equilibrium constant , concentration of the monomer increases , then t c also increases.	10.44043946281109
So that , the if you use external fillers , particular fillers to disperse them well in a polymer matrices.	10.156664042518043
They get the monomers from other source or they might make themselves as well and they , after making the polymers in the plant they also do this steps themselves , from this intermediate product.	10.150209445683295
H /.	10.489651948516151
For example calcium alginate although insoluble in aqueous medium gets solubilised by certain ions like phosphate ions.	9.880159634830125
Pie 2 comes down you can take any two point , now if that process of phase sep spontaneous phase separation happen the delta g mixing of that process would be given by the value of this , which is the distance between the interaction point of the tie line , this is tie line.	11.853227805501081
This does not take part in the polymerization reaction , where for a small fraction of their lifetime , they are present in this active form.	9.921158212193763
So it is very thick syrup and at such thick syrup , the boundary film can be very thick.	10.791561961453406
Wherever hydroxyl groups are present they can replace part of them and what ends up is a matrix which has a coordination link of titanium tetra chloride salt along with the enzyme molecule.	9.87371497834616
What we got , this is the final expression , we have received.	12.022111556216561
Before i start this subject , just recap the subject matter what we discussed in the last two lectures.	10.445504098506705
So the net effect on the maximum reaction rate is experienced.	11.100145081378178
So , if the solvent you have in your hand is dried - out , then this nature might go bad.	10.140656961543527
Now if i have a polymer metrics , and they are.	8.712837777473553
This ea complex will bind with the substrate which is the active enzyme substrate complex.	10.763524096029503
We will always like to choose a commodity which is less expensive and does the job and because the enzymes are produced in small amounts by the living cell and the only source of enzyme to us are living cells and they are synthesized in very small quantities.	10.400747128413824
This is cis 1, 4 addition; this is trans 1, 4 addition.	9.114700159578712
So , this name maldi comes from there.	6.606147598271567
We will probably more appreciate why you cannot have all the polymer chains of same size or same molecular weight.	7.355399850621254
If they have to be administered for some inflammation at some site leg or hand , you can give a very small dose; it will reach the site and treat the patient.	10.729577298706145
Now there is another possibility of 1, 4 addition.	10.15481777917791
And we know that in case of radical copolymerization basically there are numerous options where you can choose two monomers and make a copolymer from there.	8.936726764466847
Whether it is a catalytic function , whether it is a purification of enzyme protein the ionic behavior plays a very key role.	9.700938383308188
And this is sold as a trade name as turlon , this is also very high heat polymer , this is also amorphous t g having 270 to 285 and the constant use temperature is 220 to 23.	11.554244583418496
For example , how the reaction takes place.	8.395231710559845
So , like this you can get the value for this interaction parameter for any of the polymers because the value of this are supplied by available in the literature.	9.360321644122068
That means the energy of activation can also be considered both in terms of entropic contribution as well as enthalpic contributions and if you separate into it then you can write k2 = rt / nh.	10.627621516036728
And just note the rate constant we are giving and with the same rate constant , the same notation , what we used for radical chain polymerization , k tr m i.	11.355557211567897
So , just again showing the same thing , with increasing temperature , the sample become stuff and ductile.	9.879610650991141
K is the boltzmann constant and t is the absolute temperature.	6.576688310657979
So , lots of bond formation is taking place; so , del h is highly negative , and because the monomers is getting tied up , del s is also negative.	8.933891248175373
But this was disputed by briggs and haldane particularly observing certain reactions which were known to be relatively fast.	9.897921046478714
A number of enzyme catalyzed reactions have been reported like lipases for ester synthesis , interesterifications , transesterifications and resolution of racemic mixtures.	9.627696144037698
When we talk of immobilization of microbial cells we could think of the cells which are viable , which can multiply.	10.22707080430064
It basically increases the tortuosity or increase the path to be covered by a gas to to come out of the polymer thickness.	11.087820791993577
So , you do not need to study polymer because the knowledge or technical knowledge for this common applications are well established , but if you think about examples of polymer like a artificial valve which is made of polyethylene.	8.071337741928208
If this co - enzyme is nad , this has to be coupled to a polymer so that the coenzyme is not lost during use.	11.291610566856884
When we look into these mechanisms and develop steady state rate expressions specifically you will end up in quite complex situations.	9.62311093774636
Either it can go this way and come here or it can also come this way and reach to this side.	10.485747580808123
So , now , with this formula , you can use , you can target a molecular weight.	9.645076791678415
First , this will react.	10.760180878691292
We know by this time.	5.651527129993517
If you decrease the temperature of the reaction , that is why cationic polymerization.	6.681608023277939
So , now you can use this for the mixture of the polymer or interpolymer distribution so that it can be useful , because it is independent of molecular weight.	8.777055905311704
So , they are dissolved at a high temperature and the column and the escaped at a higher temperature , and the separation is performed at that higher temperature.	9.22543514727407
After chemistry and physics i think the major scientific component will be biology.	11.739156975149895
On the other hand the fraction of the exit stream which is older than the t1 will be t one to infinity edt or this will be one minus zero to t1 edt because the total zero order infinity is one.	7.821641532816206
But if the enzyme is not stable even at 20c you may have to go to 4 degrees to immobilize and the definition of mild will remain at 4 degrees.	9.580497281173338
Its use in cstr is difficult mainly because of its loss through the product stream if it is too fine a particle.	12.71095779017386
Simply by entropic contribution of binding the enzyme can reduce the energy of activation by about 10 - 15 kcalmol - .	8.91653501533454
A very important role is played by physics.	9.091076271187026
So , theoretically , we have seen that it can never be 2 or more than 2, but in practice , we find that after end of the polymerization reaction , if you do explanatory finally what is polymerization distribution , you find that it is slightly over .	10.415405456931659
The practical operational temperatures of enzyme reactions therefore are chosen on the basis of not just the optimum temperature that means the optimum temperature for the enzyme reaction rate but also taking into account the deactivation kinetics because the interest will be on the total productivity of the enzyme per unit enzyme rather than only initial reaction rates.	10.809288053820723
We were yesterday talking about reversible inhibition that is those inhibitor molecules which reduce the rate of an enzymatic reaction by reversible interaction with enzyme molecule and after the inhibition is over they can be physically separated and the enzyme can be recovered in its original catalytic functional form.	10.55417117258427
We will look at some of the examples of the carriers and finally adsorption based methods have been very often used to study the enzymology of systems that naturally occur in biological system because in case of living cells most of the enzymes are supported on a solid matrix through adsorption only.	10.092742279339435
Then isotactic polypropylene having a regular structure will slice easily and that will be hard molecule.	10.668729388416677
And , how do you determine , what are the number of molecules.	9.115109950320207
Deae - cellulose , amberlite etc which are charged particles and these charged particles based on the electrostatic interaction can bind the enzyme molecules at a ph where the net charge is counter.	12.66374033809614
In that case before we go to a total mass transfer a closed box picture of diffusion we can break it into the external film diffusion and internal pore diffusion and look them separately and check if they can be analyzed along with the chemical reaction under steady state behavior because even the enzyme reactor that we have looked at are to be analyzed under steady state situation.	9.770677295901606
Then , you can have copolymers.	9.189859146928587
There is no enzyme present and the reaction is stopped.	9.694964269795646
The two molecules will have six degrees of freedom.	9.75582574539544
All the enzyme is immobilized on the surface , a typical particle on which enzyme is only on the surface.	9.720195837494812
Otherwise they will be almost similar kind of behavior.	11.444188914920954
And we discussed the effect of pressure , on the rate of polymerization molecular weight in very briefly , and we talked about thermodynamics of chain growth polymers , we talked about the ceiling temperature , and relations between ceiling temperature and the monomer concentration at equilibrium.	10.1356176824488
There could be the other differences as well and this is not , at not , as temperature sensitive , as cationic polymerization.	10.490009699322961
The other examples now in this slide and the coming few slide where we are talking about other polymers , i will just mention few examples.	9.48680360109443
So , they might get lost during the processing conditions.	7.610803445210306
When this function is minimum your reaction velocity will be maximum and that will be given by ( h + ) m = vka . kb you get the minimum value of this function.	10.269956262470316
So , you know gla we now discussed , we know the , what is haze clarity reflection , and gloss.	9.731522602477959
Similarly temperature and nature of substrate also are important parameters and they have the similar features as we saw in the case of water in aqueous medium.	9.721626871477072
So , at the end , you will variably land up in a random copolymer , random arrangement of these two monomers , two functional , two monomers unless specific tapes where the reactions rates are very high.	8.043341517307733
Now , if you have this of most of covers , all the conditions , all the criteria if you have need to follow a successful completion of a step polymer.	9.344875264541905
Consider a small differential element in this pore and along which the mass balance can be made.	9.890285284994498
And amorphous region , where amorphous material , where there is no order.	9.546733374283294
So , it will have much lower del h value.	6.244716477693234
So , so no change in number of molecules , either as a result no change in x n bar , no change in molecular weight as well.	9.681444853596135
And not in detail just briefly , and then begin our discussion on chemistry of polymer additives.	11.34817862406253
The enzymes that are very strongly substrate inhibited may show an effectiveness factor greater than one because the reaction rate when the substrate concentration drops becomes higher than at the surface.	9.567047804237239
And out of this listed spectroscopic method , we will mainly discuss the nmr techniques to use up the nmr techniques mainly and we will briefly mention about uv visible , and ir spectroscopy , and we have discussed mass spectroscopy in the last class.	11.0962784439038
So all these parameters need to be optimized for a particular enzyme system to be able to get a gelatinous mass , which is crosslinked enzyme preparation.	10.804690138551095
If in this case , the centers or this have similar geometries , all these monomers are linked with same geometries are stereo stereochemistry , then we call this as isotactic.	9.459629226403644
During the stages of beer after fermentation is over it is clarified and is stored for sometime.	11.11369718903804
So , when you define degree of polymerization it is the number of structural units not the number of repeat units present in a polymer.	8.87972224044899
The chemistry of that can be considered like this.	9.998653894791492
And the same time he should or she should know , what are the ways you can minimize the cycling formation in a step polymerization.	7.761135579562505
This gives a polymer like this , ok.	8.71100984420346
For that you might spend lot of time , but reaction happens very quickly within second and because it happens so quickly , generate lots of heat and sometimes there is a heat management is also a problem.	10.775481889958659
So , you do not need not to maintain a stoichiometry of say very close to one is to one like the other linear poly condensation reaction here.	7.317463688750255
But ultimately this cycling is not continuous over a long period of time and that is still inherent problem.	8.90186733516524
Positive role in the sense , that you can restrict the formation of any of the by - products.	12.59869737334388
The difference is that in the case of acid base catalysis there is no covalent bond formation.	10.253237517306586
Micelles are this surfactant aggregates can be other types as well depending up on the concentration of the surfactant , or the or the composition of the aqueous medium , whether there are salt present or not , it could be cylindrical or lamellar or other aggregates can be possible.	10.424521321026152
Now , radical get produced in the initiation reaction and they get destroyed in the termination reaction , which we just going to talk in a minute.	8.595384714446213
So if you multiply nitrogen content by 6.8 you get the net protein.	9.13825983140323
Then we came to bi - substrate reactions and the effect of substrate concentration , writing the rate expression and finally concluding with the discrimination of various reaction mechanisms that are involved in bi - substrate reactions.	7.840417771125943
Gloss relates to the reduction of intensity of lights scatters specularly of the surface.	10.627632342361428
For example , if i consider ionic , cationic polymerization of isobutylene by tin chloride catalyst , then the reactivity of this reaction or the rate of reaction follows rp , follows in the order like this , nitroethane , nitroethane , phenol , water , which is basically the ranking of the acidity of this cocatalyst.	9.410901921287394
They are not taking part in the reshuffling reactions which means the nature of the copolymer would depend upon the reactivity of this group.	6.620653734582676
The same expression can be used for this scenario as well.	8.428324819892875
Whatever concentration of substrate that has reached at the surface from there to the pores of the particle we are considering.	10.337335417024494
And as these ionic centers are very reactive , they are very sensitive to , very sensitive to impurities , which includes moisture because they are very active , reactive.	9.649488731209994
Then obviously the difference it will be nearer to 0 the chi h value would be nearer to .	10.879747959847116
In fact it has shown to give some kind of enzymatic activity which can be called as nadh oxidase; it oxidizes the reduced nad into oxygen like an oxidase activity and it generates hydrogen peroxide and this hydrogen peroxide to break down requires peroxidase or else it will inactivate the original enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.	10.476985276236974
Let us take the same example to get the or discuss the mechanism.	8.707091655103161
There is a layer of film through which the substrate has to diffuse to reach to the enzyme active site and as a result of this there is a concentration gradient.	9.054325761873853
So carbon dioxide can be left out; but ammonia cannot be sent back to the body and ammonia is removed by ion exchange resins and other metabolite which are generated if any in the blood sample they are taken care by activated carbon and the body fluid of the blood through a system is then sent back into the patient valve.	10.917272189785608
This , this is the step , which is rate determining step.	12.311741140249435
Because , it is an intrinsic ability , the intrinsic viscosity is very gives lot of useful properties , lot of useful information , and which will be utilized in determine molecular weight , and other things which will discussed in next lecture.	10.153408023239475
That means the batch reactors are very suitable for small scale experimental studies mainly because that they are simple in construction and operation and they don t need any supporting structure unlike in the case of continuous reactors where you need to feed the substrate stream continuously so you need a pump.	9.80174196403112
Now , coming to the experimental points , what are the experimental consideration we must do for this light scattering experiment.	9.974843851387803
Basically , it is steric effect of the substituent group.	12.367607924375138
On the left hand side are the parameters which are important to be compared and there is no method absolutely reported in literature which can meet all the requirements.	9.252813962792693
And some of the and some will take these resins in plates or granular form and then make the other additives to make the final part.	9.798248553387495
On the other hand when the temperature was reduced the system became diffusional unlimited and the activation energy was much higher , which was 9.4 kcal / mole.	7.870489506141208
So , no special preference of or hindrance from one of the other side s; let us wipe it off to avoid confusion , this one.	9.581909908436826
Notice the two terms which i have highlighted here.	13.012303326116633
Another example we can talk about say , bisphenol a polycarbonate and polymethylmethacrylate , if the length or the molecular weight of the polymethylmethacrylate is high then they do not form miscible blend whereas , this two form miscible blend as long as the molecular weight of pma is small like polymer.	10.277577296802551
And , hydrolysis process , basically reduce the chain length.	8.313821354441115
So , what is done to tackle this problem a tri a amine is added in the organic medium , say triethylamine or trimethylamine and when this reacts with this species it is form a salt now this is water soluble.	8.641973165611041
In the recent years number of applications have already emerged but on a limited scale and probably the scope it offers is much , much larger than it is being practiced today.	8.642614715024132
So , the hydrogen bonding in acrylic acid polymer is much lower compared to acrylic acid monomer , which means del h value will be lower for acrylic acid compared to say acrylonitrile.	9.64245151935135
And t half value for , at 10 hours the temperature at which , t half value becomes 10 hours , its typically the most , what i say , most used temperature , where t half is 10 hours , and for that a i b n is about 60 degree centigrade and b p o is about 65 degree centigrade , but it is all depends upon how fast you want to carry out reaction , you have to choose your temperature accordingly; for example a i b n , and if you want to use a 100 degrees , it is too faster reaction.	10.016165080253161
But the l l dash can be same or different; from different metallocenes like cyclopentadienyl or indenyl or fluorenyl.	10.336649876486382
And ionic chain polymerization is very sensitive to solvent polarity , as we discussed from last week s lectures and especially for anionic polymerization.	9.45090860088908
I think we will stop here and continue to discuss the behavior of enzyme reactors.	7.885104058320167
So , i , i can write a generic equation or expression , say i , i for the initiator and yz , this is for your coinitia , i for the coinitiator , this is for the initiator or this for catalyst and this is for the cocatalyst , giving rise to a cationic species and a counter ion.	9.500967453045204
I must again clearly stress that the inherent parameters do not consider the diffusional effects or the partitioning effects.	9.094262882987021
Actually , from the radio activity measurements , you can actually get the incorporation of individual monomers in the copolymers.	10.363047768422856
So , how do you name this one.	5.699146811172902
We also studied what are the strategies for controlling molecular weight in a step polymerization and two recommended strategies are either , one should use a slight excess of the one of the two bi - functional monomer or a slight amount of a chain stopper which is nothing but a mono - functional group.	9.099023464247017
On the other hand you also see when you come to s0 / km as hundred approaching towards zero order regime the quantities remain almost equal all through , till you arrive at 90 plus or more than 95 % fractional conversion.	8.686795343224539
Then you are sure in one thing that your km and vm values are somewhere in this range.	9.225430663664811
If the reactivity of the original radical propagating radical is very high , then it cannot distinguish that extent and other weight , even if there is a difference in the reactivity of these two molecules towards this.	10.670460551829905
In between there are few polymers , which highly conjugative polymers , they have conductivity in the range of semi conductor , and they are called conducting polymers , and they basically not the commodity , or they are not produced in large amount.	11.35727513921362
So , this t 1 you have two binodal points and two spinodal points.	7.927236964910636
The difference between the two slopes is the 1 / klam.	8.872727093557096
Now this significant amount , fix amount is basically is prefixed.	10.463337846006242
For example , one beta proton transfer to either monomer or counter ion or say polymer itself , solvent or some impurities , which is present or a transfer agent , like the case of chain radical polymerization , we talk about the chain transfer is possible.	10.186669021597119
In the zero order regime the space time will be identical in the two cases.	7.543336414373727
The other entropies like transitional , vibrational , and rotational entropy are associated with molecules.	9.19977398329132
P is not the conversion unlike step growth p is not a conversion here.	12.380258529878748
But the use of soluble enzymes has certain very serious problems and the problems are listed here : one is that the enzyme has a higher molecular mass , a very large molecule protein and impermeability through biological membranes.	10.99652596786075
So , to reach at level of 100 degrees of polymers , you have to reach a concentration level of water molecules as low as these , 10 to the minus 4 order whereas , if you have 10 to the 2 order of k , you can leave with 10 to the power of minus 2 level of h 2 in the system.	9.914644702705695
The batch reactor can be used both for soluble enzyme as well as for immobilized enzyme . you can carry out a batch reactor in a stirred mode or in a packed bed mode with using total recycle and on the right hand side is the characteristic profile of the reaction species that is the substrate and product with reference to time.	10.094889587845811
So , we have the monomers which have undergo ionic copolymerization their reactivities are not too different.	8.366575890291436
Because of the nature of certain non - polar side chains to drift away from the water molecule , which in the case of an enzyme solution is usually water , it causes the non polar side chains to burry inside the core.	9.986064536145344
Now , in some polymer system which are not very frequently observed , you get this type of behavior which is a lower critical solution temperature , where the entropic term entropic term is negative.	10.110212986641287
And if there is the monomer is very complex you know or it has substituted parent name also you have to put bracket before you prefix the polymer poly term.	10.003676582156967
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry.	2.2688526398027764
In the case of an un - competitive inhibition the reaction velocity can be written as s.	5.623906293033185
Now , let us talk about other possibilities.	5.161193599417403
But as i mentioned in earlier , these are the generic examples , which we get in this page.	11.24709933314424
I also pointed out that vm is not a constant; it s a function of enzyme concentration and we must take a corresponding kinetic parameter as k2 which is often called as turn over number.	9.418491440785397
For example , if i write this , say , place an example of methyl methacrylate , this is the chain end where you have a.	8.495830608151019
The t g for this is minus 73 c and t m is 28 degree centigrade.	10.073121937903192
And , is typically the initiator efficiencies , initiator efficiencies lie around say 0.3 to 0.8, which means that the , among all the radical species which are generated around 30 percent to 80 percent of the radicals , actually generate or initiate a chain polymers.	9.480215987252265
We come to the end of this module on chain polymerization.	6.886041097774511
And the because it cannot stabilize the radical much so we are reactivities also comes down.	7.893963550789934
A very specific method is applicable either for very high value products or where the number of stages required are very large , they can be minimized to a small number.	10.822377162993327
In isolation and purification one of the very characteristic features is that most of the enzymes are purified by a series of steps.	10.371101443387175
And we did a detail discussion about mechanical properties , and we also discussed about thermal properties , and little bit of fire resistance properties of polymers.	9.054999099188139
So , you need a higher temperature , for doing the polymerization reaction.	6.380977212104075
We also discussed different types of monomers or types of monomers , which can be polymerized in radical chain polymerization mechanism and which are the types of monomers , which cannot be polymerized or it will difficultly polymerized in radical chain polymerization.	8.499004900653661
And , if you have these consecution over 5, 5 carbon atom or 5 double bonds basically , then it will produce colour.	10.030659032987531
Similarly , if you see that this is not following , this actually following even less than that; which means , that some of the initiator react initiator which are produced , they are actually; even you know they form the radicals which are produced by , and form the initiator molecules , they are not taking part.	10.278617105921882
The reactivity of the concern group at the end of that residing , at the end of the chain are same as when the conversion was smaller.	9.066427558221156
The basic principle of acid base catalysis is more or less identical.	8.553523279789099
Now , this is the octahedrally coordinated crystal and because it has to maintain electron neutrality , the titanium or the surface is five coordinated titanium and have a vacant d - orbital.	8.212375965759618
Then you can react with amino group of the enzyme molecule.	6.836233183175906
Let us just go back to earlier page and repeat this.	9.294238451895545
So in those cases lower fractional conversion but we keep very high stake on productivity; productivity is tried to be maximized.	10.255171920648579
Now if you look at the experimental value of a viscosity versus molecular weight of a polymer; viscosity tilled entanglement molecular weight , viscosity increases steadily with a slope of one , but above entanglement molecular weight the polymer chains and the entanglement.	9.840340624721014
So , which means that one by t c is proportional to m to the power half; that means , the critical temperature is again like the critical composition in this , critical temperature also varies with the molecular weight.	9.221051825789818
The hydrolysis of starch goes through three different stages; gelatinization usually a heat treatment process , starch gel which is acted upon by alpha amylase which is very , very economical or very cheap enzyme cost wise.	10.3646094625087
The third feature in favor of the batch reactor is the use of insoluble substrates.	8.466571146310649
The design of enzyme reactors , like in the case of chemical reactors is based on kinetic pattern.	10.485586400078162
Now this is constant for a particular polymer solvent temperature system.	6.809207637074907
So , let us take another example.	5.907030809071325
As a result , you can get effective different composition , which is not predicting from their r 1 and r 2 values.	8.745676725152672
We have multiplied here too or v / d either way.	9.231853193563069
So approach of r to this carbon is always preferred over this carbon.	10.9266776677562
You can use the expression which we will get it for the simple , any of this simple scenario where you have b or aa bb.	10.356105984433235
Here the f2 is not of the total feed stream.	8.46216281559654
Now , if we can stop those chemicals reaction then basically , we can stop the spreading of the flame.	9.691508242263438
That means you bring in an enzyme solution in contact with a carrier and leave it over night or over a long period of time.	6.971375707700768
In many cases the enzymes may exhibit a very broad specificity not too strictly specific.	8.598862271545745
Rest of the molecules which have much lower energy content will not be able to lead to product formation . on the other hand when we consider the second area where we use a catalyst the main role of a catalyst as we will also further confirm is to reduce this energy of activation by some means.	10.550066583182712
For example here you see that this is a typical soluble enzyme shown here.	7.327993773772779
These properties are called colligative properties and we know that there are four colligative properties; osmotic pressure of the solution , lowering of solvent vapor pressure , elevation of solvent boiling point , and depression of solvent freezing point.	10.250938495998273
In that case , we can afford to leave more amount of condensate molecules in the polymerization medium in order to build high enough molecular weight.	8.31085022922787
One can also consider either as a special case of ternary complex formation or a special case of binary complex formation.	7.526166168600723
For example , this pet is shown here; polyethylene terephthalate polyester , they can react with water and hydrolyze.	9.32691440561708
In this case , the dash is the mole fact , number of moles of the molecular mono - functional group having b.	7.918913269312596
We just assumed the hypothetical value of km , corresponding vm is calculated in a table and we draw a straight line with reference to let us say s1v.	11.942488140966196
In fact the basic role is played by the unfavorable interactions present in the active site.	7.557704146465175
And , colour may form , also from these protonated polyenes as it is shown in this figure.	9.254124549356503
I must again here remind one thing; this reaction velocity is based on surface area and not volumetric reaction velocity as we are usually used to in the case of soluble enzymes.	9.678199954177298
That means property of a polymer sample cannot be always obtained from just single value of same end , which is the arithmetic or average , like this case.	10.06297484686879
Now , we talked about this electron transfer initiation by , for example , gave this sodium and naphthalene and we talked about propagation step and how propagation step depends on the solvent polarity.	10.317512223530956
Let us compare example of polydimethylsiloxane or p d m s.	8.779143385179378
So , how many different ways you can place the first segment of polymer.	6.2709176361901635
Even in the case of glucose isomerase when we carry out the industrial reactions , the substrate concentration which is used is about 2.5 - 3 molar glucose which means almost about 45 - 50 % weight by volume.	9.927742446875062
Secondly it is also important to keep the enzyme in a good state that is not to allow inactivation of the enzyme.	10.243136439729412
These two molecules have a very distinct difference in their solubility at different ph; very distinct.	11.198957229432645
And 1 minus a are the number of chains , which kinetic chains , which has undergone termination reaction by the disproportionation reaction.	10.274838092651777
So , this expression is valid for point scatterer where no intramolecular interference happen between them no interference happened between the scattered light; the same scattered light originate from the different parts of a scatterer.	8.727214570976612
This clearly demonstrates the role of diffusional limitations on the effect of km and with the particle size increasing the system becomes more and more diffusion controlled for the particle is bigger.	12.453108973382088
You name , you know wear shoes , everything.	13.701830917459544
But the path way which leaves the enzyme species in both directions is not permissible.	10.403194630836138
Phi 1 is given by n 1 n 1 plus x n .	8.569706371566086
So , this is the combinatorial entropy for the mixture and this is entropy for the solvent and this is for the solute before mixture.	9.005520255446859
So , you can guess obviously , you can expect that this term would be higher than this term , because this was for polyethylene molecule , and this is for more stiffer chains , so this term would be higher than this expression , and this term is usually comes around 1.5 to 3..	10.734650171591511
If you look into the mechanism of substrate binding to an enzyme active site something similar happens.	8.570044199084283
Once a substrate molecule binds to one of the binding sites it makes a drastic conformational change so that the affinity is increased very significantly.	10.701004061257862
At high temperatures these similar activation energy was obtained even at high substrate concentration as in the case of low substrate concentration because at high temperatures the reaction rate was high.	9.515434096230674
So in the two cases on the right hand side is the hydrolysis of l form.	7.618439276488195
So , basically it is a fifty - fifty mixture of isotactic polymers , dyads and racimic dyads; which is a completely atactic polymer.	9.561894546778337
Stereoregularity in a polymer molecule , is critical , so if syntactic or iso - tactic polymer will have bitter crystalline , crystal ability , then ataractic polymers co - polymers are.	12.122467394145037
This is expansion happened due to because the polymer coil is in solvent.	9.605913874686365
But it is only a special case of an ordered mechanism where ordered ternary complex formation is not denied.	9.919494883970357
Another testing where , a load is just applied of actually , allowed to drop from a height on a circular disk and it can break this material or it can make a hole , just hole depending upon the energy.	11.190699734412929
Let us talk about the polar effect first.	6.988069498271292
Such reactors had been very poor in terms of long term operations mainly because of the adsorption of the enzyme on to the membrane surface.	11.565870249618149
There will be a gradient of substrate in the boundary layer.	8.169294261804318
So , let us start our discussion on polymer processing very briefly as i said , polymer processing can be done from a melt state or a solution state.	7.688045663824732
And , pvc is a very prone to degradation under processing.	10.310070576226538
If you are talking about because we are thinking the polymers as hard particles; that are why the term suspension , we are using instead of solution , but intrusion that is the solution.	9.92009238310005
So , this is the molecular structural units , this is the number of structural unit present in one chain and this is the number of such ends and you can sum total with it and sum up all such x mar , so all of x.	8.281946081468456
The basis of kjeldhal method is primarily estimation of nitrogen content.	13.294825942119239
Here r1 and r2 indicate the distinction between two amino acids and the carboxylic group of one and amino group of other amino acid condense and form a - conh bond which is known as peptide bond.	10.464445022426839
So , basically these two are again examples of structural isomers in case of polymer chemistry.	7.506427069082187
Lock and key arrangement was very easily able to explain the unimolecular reactions.	10.886131518060804
Normally we will prefer a carrier which is not very expensive.	12.191530013030443
Now when this in resonance , it will form this chain end.	9.203228561097493
It will flow the solvent molecules will flow past each other; it happens even for flexible chain if the coil size is little low , and that is dominant for this short chains.	10.255863160397777
So , basically from this discussion we can understand that a plot of log m versus elution volume should give a linear relationship and v e should decrease with increase in the log m.	9.506200184077162
Now with , you can get this information from this test , basically we can know , at what temperature this polymer start decomposing or degrading , and we can basically find out the temperature at which 50 percent weight loss or complete weight loss , whatever is you interest.	10.380792152799023
Now , let us talk about this monomer.	3.88382312249213
And if the chain transfer or transfer constant goes up , then also the molecular weight comes down compared to the case where there is no transfer.	9.519737806046884
So , this huggins equation can now be written as directly eta r is equals to c plus.	9.477586814543468
And in this lecture , we will continue our discussion on polymer solutions , the remaining part , and then start a new topic on chain dimensions , polymer chain dimensions.	7.27127188936961
And , obvious; and also , the interaction between the additives and polymer might be different at that higher condition , higher temperature and higher share rate.	9.964368092423735
Some may not be so.	10.734186568900956
And , these hydrolysis , such hydrolysis is favored during high temperature processing.	8.602522028707385
In this case we took example of sodium and naphthalene and in this case you can see this final or initiate thing chain species form is this , which actually can extend or propagate from both the sides.	7.9883049970317135
Now a increases as the coil expansion occurs in good solvent; in good solvent the coil expands.	10.818177485551981
With respect to the varying a you get a competitive inhibition pattern.	11.121021711810583
F is equal to one and as we defined earlier kappm was equal to km / pf and p we have considered as a constant parameter as far as the immobilized enzyme preparation is concerned and the diffusion does not play a controlling role here if f is equal to one.	9.863559571358511
One was proposed originally by natta and which is a bimetallic mechanism.	11.694349072710812
Now , another assumption is made in this approach is that e p 1 is same as e m 1 and we can and we write this as e .	12.148868571181039
So , the reactivity order would be this.	6.169860114312851
If you consider n binding sites what will happen in such a situation is that with each binding site being occupied by the substrate , the next subsequent binding sites will have much more affinity.	9.868491065912151
A very crude definition could include it as a hybrid device where a biological recognition molecule or a cell or cell component is integrated with a physical or chemical detector.	9.700810765787153
So , this is a cis product.	5.150348266493204
You have to develop an analogy and understand the relationship of the corresponding terms.	9.562384528439472
And that micro structure actually determined eventually , the properties of material.	8.929470334667458
Finally kinetics and stability of immobilized biocatalyst a very important feature which probably dictates the choice of the immobilized enzyme preparation.	8.938745194784932
But when you make a part its has its own load , it has some weight , so it has own load , and when you stack it this disk , basically the lower one will also have load from top.	11.00915228987111
So , what we know that that radical polymerization will always give preferably syndiotactic syndiotactic polymers.	8.718903303216356
Now , n b is r is n a by n b.	8.208963783705618
We can identify this m and r from spectroscopic techniques like m m r.	9.08965243743884
In fact i have shown here only one step just for sake of clarity and removing the congestion whereas this process might undergo more than one humps.	10.53502803867237
Now , this classification of step and chain growth polymers also is not completely unambiguous.	9.208416780912792
Again there are companies sell these polymers in different trade names and this is not expressively.	13.55430411521778
So , for cationic chain polymerization , no matter whether chain transfer reaction is present or not , you always end up having higher molecular weight.	8.312786353183775
And , to prevent that , what are the things we might do or it is typically done.	9.259695331761247
In that case , if you want to build high molecular weight in a closed system without removing the condensate out of the polymerization medium , then your k value , the value of the equilibrium constant has to be quite high to build a descent enough molecular weight which is that is why , it is never practiced.	10.002219802621216
One of the considerations in such a system is that all the path ways that converges at a particular enzyme species are permissible.	10.403845831499348
I think we must appreciate that the rate equation has a very new dimension in terms of rate constants.	9.267298136330206
Ease of catalyst replacement and reactor cost and ease of fabrication are the factors which are dependent on the type of enzyme reactor.	9.659121626145815
So , if this makes you , again cooh square.	7.337521133856255
The second category of effector molecules that we noted was inhibitors.	8.749361712109096
So , that is one of the ways you can determine from experimental value , experiment different experiment with different feed ratio and stopping the reaction at low conversion and then measuring the mole fraction of different monomers in the copolymer , but this is a old method.	9.010859411851007
They show absolute specificity.	10.233247263734562
And we know that it undergoes glass to rubbery behaviour change.	8.324031456371916
But when i say k2, i am referring k2 in the sense of the original catalytic function which was present , which is retained and only in the presence of a bound inhibitor on the inhibitor binding site , the catalytic function is lost.	10.268112091129947
The decay in the reactor performance will be more pronounced in the case of substrate independent thermal deactivation compared to cstr.	9.039051021950247
So , functional groups how many now.	9.451315442672124
If we want find out rate of this polyester exhibition reaction or the step growth polymerization , you need to know the rates of each step , and then sum up to get the rate of the final polymerization.	10.685895431181065
The applications do not emerge till they are available in large quantity.	8.820375036042732
So , you can simply write f 1 is r 1 f 1, plus f 1 f 2 or f 1 by f 2 is.	8.961327241661635
So , we can use this expression and from that , we can actually get the value for r 1 and r .	7.33799384106222
So , this is very simple where and this is done mostly from if the polymers are made from a single monomer which monomer is directly converted to the polymer , so styrene to polystyrene and acrylonitrile to poly acrylonitrile.	10.037526025730608
Now , by this , you may not have to remember all this approach , unless you are extremely interested to know the logic behind to get the final expression.	10.193092672378848
So , we will in this we will use m n for most of the time.	8.052182475806836
So , the chances of this type of carbonate linkage is forming 0.25, if i have fifty - fifty ratio in the feed.	5.937767434069032
E - kt . edt what it amounts to is that if you have a residence time distribution for any real reactor in the form of edt and if you also have the rate constant k , the first order rate constant which can be evaluated for enzyme reaction and you can get all the reaction fraction of the exit stream which has been collected and sum it over , it will give the mean age distribution , the mean substrate concentration in the exit stream.	10.150588612763988
So if you compare these two expressions , the one we already wrote in this page and the expressions which we know from flory - huggins equation we can write pi is rt.	9.94276780818616
A sometime small molecule comes out of the polymer , though we are heating , like is hcl from polyvinyl chloride h 2 o from amic acid.	10.959772587516316
On the other hand the protein concentration also gives us an idea of the amount of an enzyme present in a given sample.	8.574274548656875
These enzymes are often involved in many of the constitutive functions of a living cell where the cell wants a very broad specificity and thats why the nature has evolved these group specific enzymes.	9.874333366843105
And if you compare with radical chain polymerization , solvent polarity actually has no such role to play in case of radical chain polymerization.	6.875752023082615
He proposed the initial reaction rate for such a reaction can be given by an expression given here.	10.295122830580214
Thus , we have just seen from the freely rotating bond.	12.828663943847571
Polycarbonate is synthesized from two monomers this phenol a and phosgene to give you polycarbonate.	13.24178880342072
If you talk about p , what happens , that what happen when x n is infinity , when x n can become infinity.	10.062673067616272
It can also bind to histidine group and similarly give you an immobilized preparation with diazonium bond.	8.69094812234431
So , it has to be z minus .	6.89266771241755
So , basically m 1 will have a much higher tendency to more polymerize , whereas m 2 has little tendency to move polymerize.	8.608327299706929
So , that is , that is good.	6.81149852185581
Because , the stoichiometry are the interface is always maintained at one is to one , because reaction is not happening in the valve phase of the two monomers it is happening only at the interface and because reaction happening one is to one.	8.18388585896467
There are several columns by through which they send these gases before they actually can utilize this gases to pure the inert atmosphere in the reaction , in the reaction environment.	10.910723085369124
What happened to a polymeric material; the visco plastic material , how does it happen , how does it respond with time.	8.785412447179057
If the inhibition constant for this is km and if the system has to come to equilibrium , then the equilibrium constant for reaching esi from either side must be identical and this inhibitor constant will also become a km.	10.534382638708449
There are still problems.	8.922612097523695
Plasticizer increase the free volume , t g goes down , and cross - linking also decreases the amount of free volume , so t g goes up.	9.423086568049984
These three systems , the biological unit , transducer and anylate have to have a linkage.	10.756627813643133
What we also have seen this from this equation that the x n bar is linearly dependent on the initial monomer concentration as well , which means that to increase for a given rate constant , it is always referred to use a high concentration of monomer and that is why , typically this reaction are done at very high concentration in solution or in some cases , they are done in a bulk.	10.385008118853897
Now , how do you get this values for q and e now arbitrarily it has been assigned styrene.	7.485145722711963
So , depending up on which what is the origin for scattering for different electromagnetic radiation whether it is a light scattering or x - ray or neutron scattering; the optical constant will be dependent on the difference in polarizibility or electron density and so on.	9.388492557968279
Another very important feature is resistance to microbial , thermal or mechanical degradation because as you recall right in our definition we mentioned that it is required to be used over a long period of time.	7.925308206805631
And , you also discussed different steps involved in a radical chain polymerization and kinetics of radical chain polymerization.	7.443785647480921
The term k2, the rate constant k2 is usually in many cases it is fast also like for example in the case of invertase itself k2 has significant magnitude.	10.361601041286232
R p 1 is given by k p 1, m 1 dot , m plus , r 2 is given by k p 2, m 2 dot , m plus , so on; and , this r p n is given by k p n , m n dot , m.	9.009901951885206
Besides the inhibition pattern the next step if you recall is the relative concentration of feed substrate and the magnitude of s0 / km and the kinetic regime of the reaction.	9.322180197399026
So , in inelastic deformation , loss of energy happens and if at all it returns to the original state then , it does in a different route.	9.611659583543611
S as the interaction point and thereby you can calculate both.	12.321227303717887
And this d z is equal to this quantity where k is the boltzmann constant , t is the temperature , f 0 is we can get from stokes equation , 6 pie eta 0 r h where r h is the hydrodynamic volume; perform this we can get if we know eta 0 and the temperature , and value of this from this dynamic light scattering correlation.	11.081938636143374
In between the two the enzymes follow some kind of a mixed kinetics and that is one very characteristic feature of enzyme catalyzed reactions that instead of following a fixed kinetic order it follows a changing order of reaction kinetics at the two extremes.	10.889175875489235
So , you can have a meso , m r; which gives you a heterotactic or atactic stereo arrangement.	8.084158190443059
Wherever we are considering the involvement of ionisable substrates or the products that are formed which are ionisable , the hydrogen ions will play the role of an inhibitor or an activator.	10.871973866527494
Now this t g , we will talk about this d s c , how t g obtained.	9.146004909854438
In the absence of calcium ions , the enzyme substrate complex is not very stable or the dissociation constant of enzyme substrate complex is relatively high and therefore the rate of reaction will be very , very slow.	8.132597368138823
There is always a maintenance part where it has to maintain the protein synthesis but it is being used repeatedly and in many of the organs of the cell , the enzymes are supported on certain organelles so that they behave almost in a fashion of insolublised enzymes.	10.119488256118663
Also , we have seen that this is experimentally proven that once the length of the chain goes beyond 3, then the reactivity actually becomes independent of the chain length of the oligomeric species.	9.655352195120171
We cannot , this is very difficult to measure this , this quantity experimentally.	12.712999331604125
That is why the reactivity ratios are so different.	7.927041882789602
And compare this vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate , which is basically as we have known from our earlier discussions done in several times.	11.351696328440882
For example , if we have a diol , or a di acid , or a hydro oxide acid , in case of the polyester is , reaction is just talking about; re - activities of both the functional group 1n the bi functional monomers are same.	8.577843216809185
As the name suggests , these are those molecules which decrease the rate of an enzyme catalyzed reactions when present in the reaction mixture.	10.699189849062538
Any inhibition pattern is studied on these basic lines and yesterday we had looked at competitive inhibition and to summarize the nature of competitive inhibition the basic mechanistic step was that the inhibitor combines with the enzyme in a manner that prevents substrate binding.	10.838071409513486
For example , if you consider say maleic anhydride , stilbene or say one two simply one two dichloroethylene.	8.411489346211587
So , when molecular weight becomes infinity for the first time at what conversion , that conversion is turned as the gel point.	8.580308050153674
So , this title is probably inappropriate at this moment.	7.716289017577694
Xs0 = k 2e0t if suppose you approximate an enzyme reactor to follow either a zero order or a first order regime , knowing the values of km and k2 the error involved in that will be determined by the ratio of km / s.	10.591301458792616
It is only a matter of convention that we are following the ratio of 90 % and 10 % values.	10.189007819064763
If there , the copolymer is not soluble in the resulting monomer , then also there could be a complicated behavior of the 2 reactivity ratios.	10.285837433416104
Now , also there is no termination reaction , if your , if your termination reaction , then number of chains would increase , then the expected one and as a result , your polidispersity would go up.	10.440768794288251
Then their volatility tendency of volatility would come down as their molecule weight increases increased by this time.	9.555492299223808
In that process when the two substrate molecules gets bound to one enzyme molecule and one carboxylic group of each of the substrate molecule then the reaction is not catalyzed and then ultimate enzyme substrate complex is a dead end complex.	9.61638207649482
Then once the styrene is consumed , and then you will get the homo polymer of vinyl acetate.	9.934228340225065
Now , in in case of step growth polymers x n is considered at the end of the reaction.	5.6929494720144875
When we are talking of s , we are talking of sbulk because we are not monitoring the concentration of the substrate inside the reactor but we are concentrating on 1 / sb.	10.246578989533143
You remember , if you recall this initiating species for this reaction of polymerization of isobutylene by bf 3 plus water , this was the initiating species.	11.43571629808372
It is not a covalent linkage; it is a physical interaction and there by the enzyme is held but has been very successful method from the practical point of view.	9.991021618195695
If this solvent becomes more poor or poorer , it becomes , the polymer solvent interaction parameter becomes more than 0.5 and chains starts segregating and it is just close to , it is very close to your , so basically the contact interaction is positive , which is nullifying the entropy , favorable entropy contributions towards gibbs free energy; the favorable combinatorial entropy towards gibbs free energy.	10.597782262241873
Given everything is other is same , transmission rate will go up for a smaller size gas , compare to a higher size gas.	12.04909143539951
So , how many of a is remaining.	7.061858608820192
So , in real case , incase of real polymer chain there are long range interactions , these are long range interactions which cause the chain dimension to be generally higher than the unperturbed dimension.	9.34054878516172
So obviously if you compare this two , now there is a significant increase in the cis isomer as well.	9.773692277369202
Whereas , k d for b p o at 90 degree centigrade was 1.33 into 10 to the power minus 4 second inverse.	8.827483004208325
Most cases , in almost exclusively all the cases it is the isotactic , which get formed.	11.563077326740526
Now , for example , if we take a ri detector then this output of this detection signal is proportional to the concentration.	7.345313373330231
And you , these are the self expanded , this expression which you can look at , specific viscosity reduced viscosity inherent viscosity , intrinsic viscosity is talked about the ability , intrinsic ability of polymer chains to intrinsic , increase the viscosity of a solvent.	10.706512065777556
For all practical purposes the reaction velocity what we measure is v0 vmax that means the substrate concentration is very , very large and as i mentioned that we can never reach effectively to vm.	9.771403079579766
So , from the ratio of these two , you can now find out what is the moral ratio of the styrenic munity and the tertiary butylacrolate munity , and you already know the molecular rate of the tertiary butyl munity , so obviously , now you can find out the molecular weight of the styrene munity or styrene block as well.	8.684539987681472
Now , from our thermo dynamical knowledge we can write these expressions.	7.112742982425365
Chi c , we have only the got from last expression.	12.656570839784965
So , there is always almost equal possibility of this propagating and this propagating which mean that the resulting polymer will be a mixture of cis and trans product at a higher temperature.	8.938763246737253
So t g comes down , whereas again if we instead of a normal alkene chain in between , if you have a rigid groups which is basically restrict rotation around single bonds , the t g drastically goes up.	10.632484217717836
That means the enzyme reaction rate is modified or rather reduced to a new state in the presence of those inhibitor molecules.	7.684816036188641
The product cannot be formed without undergoing a transition state.	7.729262888625738
So , the maximum percentage t of a pmma , if you put this value here , it will come around 96 percent.	9.577117409608045
Here you see a bigger view.	10.4490367452297
Trying to draw polymer chains having different with different inks.	12.042682224074985
So , basically at the end in during the most of the reaction time , you will get same composition of the resulting copolymers.	11.693302315190579
Binding wise it may be independent.	13.776919313935087
There is some where some compromise.	10.129128668471024
The concentration of nad here is very , very small and therefore the cycling is taking place; there is no doubt.	11.517250221784622
So , if we know m w , we can get slope of c is equal to 0; we get the value for s square z , z average radius of gyration.	8.926397671247326
Then the first sign of gel formation happen and we call that as a gel polymer.	8.720772428442823
Living cells are usually used in those cases of bio - conversion processes where we require a series of enzyme reaction.	11.562757249496736
So , 2 moles kinetic chain will produce 2 moles , now rest of the 4 moles , if i consider that they undergo coupling to get terminated , then they will also form 2 moles of polymers.	9.385552688742747
And we will begin with radical chain polymerization , for about four to five lectures , followed by ionic polymerization , and other types of chain polymerization , later lectures.	11.022344226627762
We will not finish this discussion on gel permeation chromatography in this lecture; we will continue in the next lecture.	6.519438940559908
Now , at the end i ask you to hold hand and tell me , what is the average , average number of student in a particular bench.	10.055996441117298
On the large scale you can also have coils inserted into the reactor whereby temperature control can be monitored and another advantage is even you can have devices for addition of acids or alkali if ph control is the requirement of the reaction.	9.367207020058052
One of the limitations is that this is not a si unit which is an internationally accepted system of units.	10.176684118668836
Now , in those applications this fire retardants is a is a very important important criteria for regularity criteria for the polymers , to be used in those applications.	9.467071258722658
The ph requirement here is alkaline 8 - .	14.541949444825997
Now let us see i apply , this is stress or load.	11.422421520671397
We know n .	9.310601470252669
This had given example of butyl lithium , which is the very strong electrophile.	11.836855140517637
So , in this case this unit is coming from a single monomer of styrene which where double bound is replaced by a single molecules.	7.377874809240307
Do mathematical steps and you will arrive at the reactor performance equations which will give you the performance of reactor.	9.735080896427085
So , these are example about the chemical structure.	6.544995649302374
So , the preference one after one over 1 would be determined by the reference in their activation energies and if they increase their temperature , there will be no preference between this two.	8.973607376663788
Now what are the polymers possible with this molecular formula.	11.31990095985736
Now let us discuss little about this bulk scattering phenomenon , which happens very frequently in a polymer material.	8.017585816664992
Now , special type of branching if you have polymer like this where branches is coming from a single point , you get a star polymer.	10.919312197568217
Whereas , miscible polymers blend is also not desirable from , in practical point of view because if it is miscible then you get the property , which is average of those 2 homopolymers.	11.459610129082058
The first line indicates the reactor performance with respect to michaelis menten kinetics and the second line refers to when the reactor performance is in the zero order of the design that means when substrate concentration is much higher than the km value and the third line is in the first order design when the substrate concentration is less than the km value.	10.026328016058477
Eab then goes to form your e plus x plus y.	12.716550588645928
It can start by binding first with the a and then b will hook on to that or it can start with eb and then a will hook on to that or in other words that you will notice just like in the case of the non competitive inhibition the a and b both have separate binding sites on the enzyme molecule and therefore they don t interfere with each other and randomly they can bind and once the ternary complex formation has taken place the product formation will begin.	9.248368436812004
It will also influence the polymerization rate because the activity of the initiation complex depends how readily it can transfer a proton to the monomer and that in turn depends on the acidity of this cocatalyst.	9.27962776886527
So , case one is 0 and s 2 is also k ln w 2 is .	9.128857228305284
Some bonds are partially formed , they will be completely formed.	10.930613863967327
If we increase the temperature , then depending how it is effecting the values of k d i , k t and r p , the rate will vary.	9.029203409028202
When you use first strategy , you have same functional group present in both the sides , so that they do not interrupt with each other , react with each other , but you still have functional groups.	9.504439932687719
You take a central core on which spirally the enzyme sheet is wrapped around the core and in between to provide strength there is a matrix or there is a kind of a porous sheet which can keep the two enzyme sheets separated.	11.097057687900161
For example , polyester; polyester it has o h and cooh group.	8.158563684071325
So , you have a radical propagating chain and another propagating chain.	6.370366349840107
Now in last lecture , we completed our discursion on ionic chain polymerization , and we also studied our discussion on chain copolymerization , and we talked about or we discussed different types of copolymerization; namely we talked about statistical copolymer , alternate copolymers , and block copolymers , which could be different types of block co polymers , block , linear block trapped , and brass type of co polymers as well.	9.7314531053436
Now , is this polymer confirmation is fixed.	10.441060219582786
It can react with the third molecule and form m n x plus a dot so here one kinetic chain , which was suppose to continue one chain is getting broken by reacting with x a and forming a new radical , now this new radical can initiate another chain like this.	9.23075918569643
This is one arrangement and you can have same here , and now this is a arrangement which is alternating here , and this is two carbon have alternating stereochemistry , so this is a tryad , this is a t over tryad , and their arrangement is r r , racemic.	12.220539178404934
If you consider the characteristics f curves for different kinds of flow profiles , in the case of a curve you have a typical f curve for a plug flow reactor.	8.317128759989853
